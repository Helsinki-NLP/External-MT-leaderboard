A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he knew no one who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his act together".
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco native, Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, a former chef in Boston, had found his dream job six months ago when he was hired as the chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We are a small, close team, like a family, and we are old", says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and friends".
Louis Galicia says Frank first lived in hostels, but he finally got his act together.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and generous.
His way of being with his family was to cook for all of us", says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to argue with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the flow.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was a precious diamond that shone every day", she says.
Anyone with any knowledge of the case is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department's emergency number 415-575-4444.
The retired junior doctors are demanding new labor struggles.
The UK junior doctors (mostly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and asked for permission to take up new workfighting activities in a dispute over a new contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is asking the entire government to support the further work to be done starting in early September.
The JDC said the ministers had not resolved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students voted against the BMA's agreement in a July vote.
58% of the members who voted rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the junior medical committee, tweeted Thursday night a letter to JDC members saying the government "resisted obstinately" on the issues that McCourt said led to the refusal to sign the agreement.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC government has voted to reject the new treaty proposal altogether and demands that all our concerns be reopened to formal negotiations.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC has today submitted an official request to the BMA's government for permission to proceed with gradually expanding workflow from the beginning of September".
The dispute has resulted in six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first ever complete strike in the history of the UK public health system.
Johann Malawana, Director of the BMA's Junior Doctors, resigned following the vote as he did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract which the BMA had recommended.
Malawana told the BMA members in the pre-vote meetings that the deal was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Secretary of Health Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of foreigners?
It was the profession that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to reach a compromise and officially end the eight-month war on words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had a clear impression that the greatest desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties did shake hands.
But Putin's smile seemed thin and he barely felt the heat even with his own holding gauge.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin  five times, according to one report.
I didn't keep up with the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally sensed his enthusiasm, just the opposite.
But the constant coldness of Putin's image showed that the Russian capital has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the incident was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara with a strong word and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The offense was even more serious because it came from an alleged friend.
Regaining true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media campaigned thoroughly and aggressively against Ankara.
But all of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks were behind it all.
The most serious were allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-held areas in Syria.
Erdogan has vehemently denied the allegations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only held to get Putin the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
That way, Russia could have some kind of win.
The benefits of a strict ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted in a failed coup last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
The Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly the charter ban, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, travel operators and charter companies will certainly cry out for relief when air travel can finally be resumed.
They put their faith in the late-night rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruits and vegetables will fall when Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", stated an article in the economic magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it thinks the West has been greedy in responding to the coup attempt.
We must not forget the old anger at the rapid progress of Turkey's EU accession negotiations and the interference of Putin, who is keen to exploit the cold and to break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities in the wake of the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, which has its own concerns about the change of power.
Thus, at their summit in the Prameya Beach Palace, Russia and Turkey could convey what one analyst described as a "alignment of foreigners": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West combine their power.
Despite the public conciliation, the two still have major differences.
Most significant is Syria, where Moscow has established itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It is telling that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told the press conference that they had not discussed the issue at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer a question about the differences between the countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could reach a consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO member Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that after months of open hostility these two heads of state are at least once again in talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of RBS, the Bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced to provide only business services, so-called back office services, in the future.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank's global goals.
The bank had to back down when it collapsed almost eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It has sponsored millions of pounds of international sport, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now the front line has been seen as the right one to let more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain open to Scottish customers, but the abbreviation RBS will not be used.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWestern, except for head office and listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation for clients and staff at Inverness Shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is becoming an investment brand and because of the staff we have, because we are now becoming a much more diverse bank.
As the bank itself became a global brand, so RBS became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands".
RBS has already announced that it will end sponsorship of Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of various brands in sponsorship of the sport.
"Now is the right time to move into a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for our customers", says the bank's CEO.
"It would have been very strange three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched brands.
But the work we do and the focus we put on our customers' needs instead of our own has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time".
Frankie Dettori rode the Predilection to victory at Newmarket and reached his 3,000th victory.
Dettori is showering champagne after winning two consecutive Newmarket, which meant him 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori has confirmed his 3,000th win in the British Championships at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory that same night on the track of his hometown.
Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in flat-track racing.
He's been hit by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson before.
"This is special", says three-time hockey champion Dettori, who previously won the Ghayyar.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that this happened at Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly normal Friday night with a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and humbled".
Dettori receives the cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two of the jockeys who have reached milestones in obstacle course competition are the champion Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won a record 4,300 times in his career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner with 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockey's of our time, and it is no surprise that he is the one who reached this milestone, one that few have ever reached.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, and his enthusiasm and fervor have brought fans to the sport over the years".
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he hadn't only competed on weekends and only in big races!
Frank's riding career in the British Isles has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been a great follow.
He's a lively person, which is good for British racing, but most of all he's an incredible jockey".
Frankie Dettori ventured his achievement in a symbolic way by jumping down from the back of his horse.
"From flying goal-scoring to flying naked-scoring, Frankie Dettor has been a British race carrier for two decades.
I've been able to get up and down.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous Ascot 1996 victory in the "Magnificent Seven", but has also survived a plane crash and been banned from competition for drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had a hard time getting started, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his doubters, and returned to his best.
And he's not about to quit his career for a while.  Dettor recently said he wants to continue racing until he's at least 50".
Putin fired the head of the Russian administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly resigned from his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of Putin's inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin "decided to dismiss Ivanov from his post as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no grounds for dismissal were given.
The Commission has also examined the possible implications of the measures in the case of the new measures.
The 44-year-old is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated with honors from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the President's Protocol Division and the Cabinet Office, reports the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
The following words of thanks were given to Putin for his nomination: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your role as head of state, which means drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions".
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked for a divorce and recommended that Vinu be his successor.
Are your smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close associate of Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he has a KGB background.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both said Ivanov would step down at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown on the cameras, the explanations are only convincing to a few, especially during parliamentary elections.
Are you saying that the firing is the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has reacted very suspiciously to the official claim that a man who could be elected president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy.
The Kremlin's website quotes Ivanov as saying to Putin: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
I have now been the president's chief of staff for four years and eight months".
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he was deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin was acting as head of the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB), in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy head.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
In the past, it was thought that Ivanov would become the president of Russia after Putin's second term, since the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, the task went to another of Putin's closest associates, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, then returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds FBI investigator star Thomas Gibson was fired for beating up a producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent fight on location in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced the firings in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologized Thursday before his firing.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened", he says in his statement.
The details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the FBI agents in the next series will be released later, according to a press release from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Gibson, 54, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
"I was hoping to see the show through, but that's not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly, the best fans the show could have ever hoped for".
The 12th season of the series will premiere in the United States on September 28.
Mystery of the fish landing in Banffle Garden
Kevin Bain of Banff has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been washed ashore by a tornado.
Bain, who lives 500 feet [500 m] from the coast, published a vision in the Periscope and hoped to find an answer to the appearance of these five-inch fish.
Queensferry crossings are now connected to Fife.
The project, which is estimated to cost around £1.35 billion, is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected Queensferry's crossroads to the northern terminus and the mainland, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four "railroad" parts that are now almost complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The Fifé section of the bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stacks of vines.
The project, which is estimated to cost around £1.35 billion, is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
The Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Keith Brown, visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from the floor to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, and in this part of the bridge alone, over 30,000 concrete and steel have been used.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the land and the bridge is a sophisticated operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79 percent of the entire bridge is now in place, and the rest of the cover is getting its concrete lights in Rosyth today, which means the cover is ready to be lifted".
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first section of the bridge is always a major milestone in all bridge construction.
In this fantastic project, this piece represents the pinnacle of the road and water construction industry.
After the last part of the road was installed and connected to the North Tower's road, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e., terrestrial) gap.
This was done by pulling the northern plate 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive operation, but at the same time, it required high precision.
Massive because it is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3 percent inclination.
And it was very precise, because the tolerances that the work team had to observe were very small, only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went well".
Moelfre Bay Rescue tells us about three men who were miraculously rescued.
Three men who had been stranded on a fishing boat in Anglesey were saved by a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI naval rescue station issued an alert at 1.20pm local time on Friday after its crew detected the accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its unruly course without a guide.
"We saw the boat go right next to them and imagined the worst", says Vince Jones, who was sailing the lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, strong winds had fortunately driven the boat away from them".
A local fishing boat rescued two men, while the third, a 60-year-old, was found exhausted, crammed into a ditch and without life jackets.
They were all taken on board a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It is a miracle that these three men who fell under the water are still alive and in perfect health.
The boat's engine had an emergency armor, but for some reason it had been released from the man who was driving the boat when it fell.
They were very happy on the trip".
Pokémon Go is a game of health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have complained that teenagers and children no longer go out to play but instead stay inside and stare at the screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
At first, the screen time was just watching TV, then video games and, finally, smartphones.
So it's amazing to see that technology and the outside world don't close each other off.
Pokémon Go is a game application that is based on video games created in the 1990s (which later included cartoons, playing cards and other side-products).
Like many popular cultural events, this one also ended shortly before the new game was released in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Launch in other countries was delayed by a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
Within days, the number of users of Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as large as Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for Pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked by GPS, and when they find them, they can "photograph" or "capture" them.
The villain has taken a video game with him, playing a younger generation, and lifted his asses off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the average person per day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch smartwatch app Cardiogram, which found within two days of the game's launch that the number of minutes of daily movement suddenly increased from 45 percent to 53 percent. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company doesn't know which users play Pokémon Go, only the raw data on the exercise numbers.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have been deafening because of their boring campaigns and their advertisers' seemingly unhappy appearances.
However, the importance of the movement should not be underestimated.
People who move regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a host of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
This achieves three basic health benefits: exercise, fresh air, sunshine and joy.
You can even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon includes the evil pleasure seekers.
And yes, someone can walk through the door when they're playing.
What about it?
The break-in is done.
Because while apps like Fitbit might have tracked your activity earlier, they didn't give you a reason to move, like Pokémon Go does.
The appeal for innovation will disappear, and usage will decrease over time.
However, the success of Pokémon will lead to more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, which will increase the mobility of hunting people and improve their health and fitness.

Simone Biles took gold in the women's long jump.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
The dynamics jump.
I'm not a big fan of the booms.
You're gonna be a rock and a hard place.
She's great at everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American broadcaster won the world championship on Thursday and has made a difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic lightweight class.
His total score of 62,198 was clearly better than that of fellow "Final Five" silver medalist Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will compete in the women's individual foil event at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth woman in a row and the fifth American woman to win the multi-sport title, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final points came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to a whole new dimension and elevates him to the same level as other sports superstars like Michael Phelps:
Biles has been a force in her own right for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs so ambitious and accurate that 1984 Olympic medalist Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest power forward of all time".
In Brazil, there was one last competition left, which was primarily between Biles and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Springs with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States are welcoming their gold and silver medals in the women's individual foil competition at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles won his first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on the I.A. team, coordinating with now retired Martha Carolyn's family.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought anything of anything before, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program , which includes the  series of volts known for his power card, is adapted to Latin music that could well be heard on the streets outside Rio's Olympic Stadium.
It's not a coincidence.
Her adoption from her grandparents as a child and the discovery of the mother of coach Aimee Boorman has become a force to be reckoned with, and Boorman found her while she was on a visit to the day care center in the gym where Boorman trained.
He hasn't lost a single multi-race race since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite Mustafina's two laps in the lead, it was like a twist.
All that was left was the pole and the pole, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He returned to the top position after scoring 15,433 points and was crowned with 15,933 points.
Raisman gently embraced her as they waited for the final points  which was only a formality  and tears began to appear around Biles' red, white and blue shimmering border when the dream he once wrote in his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge for a four-year-old race, when he first placed third but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the relay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call the team's "mum", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent out aircrews to the public after his permanto program, and thus rose from a losing position to a winner, which at times seemed uncertain.
As for Bilis, this 19-year-old tweet made a week ago and widely circulated has now taken on a whole new meaning:
Police say they were listening to three musicals in their car and were victims of a serial killer.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder in a decade, while the victims sat in their cars talking and listening to music as they were shot, according to a police report released Thursday.
Authorities say on June 12th, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the side of the road.
The shooter was on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots from his handgun and then fled in another car, the statement said.
Police suspect the triple homicide was not theft, as the assailant did not take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the deaths were related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in areas mostly populated by Latin Americans in the past four months.
"The common occurrence is that they have been in residential areas outside homes", Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers don't want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that they are the same cause.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were killed instantly at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that the three had often sat in their cars listening to music.
Police also released a statement saying that a gunshot to an empty van was fired just half an hour before the three-man shooting, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found the shells and recovered the bullet from the car seat and the bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes to sing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital malnourishment, caused by a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Piccio, of which he was unaware when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I would not survive this.
I can't make it through this.
I'm not committed to this.
Which is not true at all  of course you are committed to it", he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in an institution.
"My reaction was that I did not believe that such a practice existed anymore", says Picciuto.
Edmund is walking on a roller coaster.
Edmund didn't get up and start peeing until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with a wheelchair and a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of the poem, which means "sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean common sign language, but it also includes the infinite invented by Edmund himself.
There may be a number of different diseases that are the basis of microcephaly: inherited, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
There's a wide range of symptoms and prognosis.
It is too early to assess the impact on the lives of those affected by Zika.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept asking, 'What's going to happen to us,
what we're going to do".
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it".
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers whose children have Zika-caused birth defects.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your children love you".
Heavy rains and floods caused large-scale rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday because of heavy rainfall and widespread flooding, and more rainfall is expected for the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are flooding their banks and spreading over a wide area as a result of heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, the Tangipahoa district alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
Flood warnings remain in effect through Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
According to the weather service, there may be an additional 76 mm127 mm of water in the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are projected to rise to record highs.
According to meteorologist Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers could be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that flooding in the Ascension district is a threat because flooded rivers are slowly draining into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, the Tickfaw River had risen to its highest point on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in western Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his half-brother were among the rescued from Gloster earlier Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 yards from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
The other half of the boy who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came in constantly", says Hansford.
"It reached my waistline".
His wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years he had lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family have all the injuries, and he himself is the only one of them who can swim.
Rescuers had rescued all three in a large military-style truck and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltered on Friday.
According to the weatherman, the floods will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports that a nearby observer in Livingston reported that between midnight and Friday morning, nearly 350 millimeters [300 inches] of rain had fallen.
Krautmann says the soil has been heavily wet since Wednesday's rains.
Officials say heavy rains and flooding forced the residents of Tangipahoa County to evacuate their homes and school hours were cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa city council had told CBS affiliate WWL that 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but now both have been flooded.
County manager Robby Miller says the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who were trapped in the flood.
The evacuations have opened shelters in Amite and Hammond.
"They can go home when the water starts to recede", he says.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly 20 streets were closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a major flood was in March", says city council member Lacy Landrum.
"This flood seems to be the same".
In Mississippi, the rains continued to rain steadily along the Gulf Coast, says Harrison County Fire and Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy says that a handful of flooded homes were reported Thursday, but no one was reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he's lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before, and more rain all the time".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was shot in the body by multiple bullets, survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, which is another 6-year-old boy who was shot in the city this week.
The boy's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
Parents said the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to the wrist, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets", the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television company.
"I can't believe this is real".
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he's had several surgeries.
The family tells the TV station that the boy is expected to survive.
He was just starting his first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man were also shot.
The condition of the other 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the condition of the other two was stable, CBS Philadelphia reports.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that the incident was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was filled with attack-type shells, which come from different assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shelves on both sides of the aisle.
Several armed fighters have been on the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told a television station.
The bullets also hit many homes and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I'm told the police are reviewing surveillance footage.
The second shooting victim in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl who was hit by a delusional bullet while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call the women's volleyball Olympic team, and there's more than one reason.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
Second, three of the strength and conditioning players on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's lineup, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also reinforced the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female energy executive has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were 1 and 2.
This is so great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose to surprise victory, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez and surprising and masterful radio programming.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
Team mate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
The views are at the peak of the species, but they are not the same in the entire country during the hours of the telescopic exercise.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same footprints as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the Final Five, as the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's final year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs run by their parents, which pay for training costs, space, travel, seating, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
Most of the installations of the TENs are located in affluent residential areas that can support the operation.
The training of gymnasts is provided by these associations, and this means a costly and long-term commitment to gymnasts' families.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both been training fans of the sport since they started their martial arts career.
We must provide a more affordable and accessible training in broadcasting for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own Air Force Foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organisation has offered free or low-cost broadcasting funding to over 15 000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin American) and a number of these have gone on to national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality broadcasting to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympics.
The exercise develops strength, agility, and body coordination, and teaches hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has inspired thousands of young girls who now want to start a squash match, and that's really great.
Participating in some sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girlpower" you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to begin their journey as healthy, strong, and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt 's proposal and are preparing for new strikes .
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes to wages and working conditions by agreeing to a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37 000 junior doctors or specialists who voted against the proposal.
Health Secretary Hunt said in July that there were plans to force the agreement, saying Britain's NHS was "no one's country" and that any further delays would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care during unsocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Committee on Juvenile Medicine, gave a statement last night, saying: "Juvenile doctors continue to be very cautious about the proposed agreement, with particular concern that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There's only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move on, because the time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the issue by speaking, but the government has been reluctant to engage in negotiations and sometimes even without any reaction.
I saw it despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the deal, and respond to the concerns of the junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors are ready for new work-fighting measures".
The previous strike at the end of April delayed almost 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times, when nurses and consultants were called to the stand-up guard to support the striking doctors.
The Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over the amendments by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend for the 54,000 junior doctors who are covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief of staff at the NHS, has appealed to junior doctors not to strike again.
Mortimer says: "Working efforts achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already on the cutting edge, causing concern, anxiety and disruption for patients, healthcare workers and their families.
We have been in consultation with the junior medical committee for the last two months, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have expressed our positive concern about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of deficiencies.
The workers were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues  such as development, flexibility in education, retraining, training costs, mutual recognition of curricula, education and gender pay gap in healthcare  was a sign of how seriously the workers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are committed to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May".
A medication that costs about € 2.40 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are now receiving a drug that costs about €2.40 a day, after the authorities recommended it for more people and longer use.
The anti-seizure drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of further heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is currently administered 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a member of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and an evaluator of new treatments, has recommended that ticaegrelor be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a member of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) that assesses the use of new treatments, has recommended that ticaegrelor be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems even further.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have a heart attack or stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fatty substance that builds up in the walls of blood vessels, which causes plaque.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is released, it can travel along the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new stroke is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The UK-based AstraZeneca tickagrelor, marketed under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of blisters.
The NICE guidance document published today recommends that ticaegrelor is given 90 mg for the next 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg and aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at the National Center for the Study of Introduction of Medicine (NICE), says: "While effective treatments are available to prevent the progression of the disease and the onset of symptoms, up to a quarter of heart attack victims experience a second stroke or stroke  often with the most fatal consequences.
The fear of renewal can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
We have found evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation of temporary use of tickagrelor adds treatment options for the thousands of people who benefit from it".
Since the efficacy and safety of tikagrelor  in particular for bleeding risk  is limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that the treatment should be used for longer periods.
The political correctness of the situation led to a flourishing of voting in Muslim areas.
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year for corruption, resulting in a government report.
The atmosphere of political correctness has led to a widespread blind eye to the electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles harshly criticized the police, election observers and city councils for blinking their eyes from election fraud "because of their over-sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Former local government minister and now known as an anti-corruption force, Pickles said that religious intimidation of voters was so bad that police should have been allowed to form security chains outside polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present their identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At this time, the voter must only give his name and address.
The report also proposes that the fingers be bathed after the vote in black, so that no one can vote twice.
Sir Eric says that whistleblowers should be protected more.
He called for improved access for journalists to the documents of the Council of State and to decisions of the informal boards and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favors them more widely in local governments", he says.
The British Prime Minister has asked for a report after the Tower Hamlet voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ordered that then-mayor Lutfur Rahman be removed from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "abusively distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and discouraged his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islam.
Rahman was said to "use the basis of his campaign to say that it was the religious duty of every believing Muslim to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were in question or were fraudulently cast by a person casting a vote in the guise of someone else.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud was coming from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the mail fraud, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were told to pressure people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote at the will of their parents, particularly in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin".
"We were concerned that . . . government institutions had turned a blind eye to such activity because of the 'politically correct' over-sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots to prevent "the harvesting of votes".
The report under consideration by Theresa May is also currently calling for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present their identity documents before voting.
I'm going to have to put my fingers in the black after the vote, so no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
The three-year limit for automatic postal voting requests.
Prohibition of political activists from handling the votes and postal ballots sent by postal mail.
The right of the police to form security chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to bring intimidation charges under the Representation of the People Act 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibiting photography at polling stations.
Only English is allowed at the polling stations (except Wales).
Enhance training to ensure a staff control rule that only one person at a time can go to the ballot box.
Sir Eric is a fierce critic of the London police and considers it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The electoral court removed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices", he says.
"He was found guilty without any reasonable doubt and the criminal record was overturned on many grounds".
He also criticized the city council's ineffective "tracking checks" by the electoral divisions.
"The court's decision in the Tower Hamlet case last year was a wake-up call", says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by some bodies' worrying and covert electoral fraud and its denial".
The resemblance of an Olympic cyclist to Duchess Catherine and other double figures at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were wildly enthralled this week by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But according to social media reports, this 24-year-old Olympian is by no means the only champion athlete who has the same resemblance to a celebrity.

CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying a Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the women's 4 x 200-meter relay, instead of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth, shocked viewers of CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has apologized after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "disappeared from the smell" and "died like a pig" during the race.
The narrator, Byron MacDonald, thought his microphone was off when he started to sound his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporting team that brought color, was heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he went fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that".
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second half in 1:57.79, and was 1.61 seconds behind Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to catch up to the beautiful China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly to the commentator's tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese mother died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air".
The final of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay, a Chinese swimmer, Ai Yanhan, was described as saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese is your egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with angry comments from Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
The tweets didn't hold back when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was.
Twitter host Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing the CBC and Canada and making us all sound like a racist gang. #anti-Semitic".
CBC host Scott Russell quickly apologized for MacDonald's remarks: "We apologize for the comment made on the newscast.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened".
CBC eventually had to apologize over 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comments.
Commentaire fellow Scott Russell was forced to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and pasted its apology to more than 90 other tweets commenting on MacDonald's remarks.
The TV company quickly issued a public apology.
"We are very sorry about these statements and the fact that they were broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show last night, and we apologized to our social media followers as well.
For the record, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not his personal.
Yet they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words".
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the radio and tried to defend his speech by saying that he didn't mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for my comment last night after the women's briefing", MacDonald said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
It is obvious that I did not mean anything offensive, and I am very sorry".
In the Primark , a woman who bartered underwear in the middle of a deal shocked customers .
The customers didn't know where to look when the woman undressed in the middle of Primark to make her underwear.
He made the situation worse by reviewing his underwear, taking it off his feet and putting it back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried four underwear suits at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
A Primark chain store in Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping center where a woman tried on her underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, says that after trying on underwear, a stranger dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He relates: "People were incredulous.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, undressed her own shirts and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but he did it without any shame.
Everyone was staring as he removed his underwear from his leg, and apparently he didn't like it because he put it back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like any of them, got dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks  nor did he think of the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had worn".
Davidson, 33, of Kent Town, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn't washed".
The case happened Tuesday afternoon.
"I have come to understand that the staff of the store tried to remove those clothes from the sale after the woman left  which is correct.
It would be terrible to take your new underwear home and find that someone else has worn them without having washed them afterwards", Davidson adds.
A Primark spokesman commented: "Primark is aware of the situation at the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been withdrawn from the market.'
I saw you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from the address of Dailymail.com can help make it a little bit safer.
We interviewed Grandmaster Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga League in New York City and asked for advice on how to handle a rifle from a nearby thief or assailant.
This video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker depending on whether the attacker is coming in front of you or behind you.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first step is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and get out of the line of fire, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker in the elbow with your knee, and when he goes through pain twice, stab him in the face with a gun pipe and pull back with the gun pointed at him.
The technique is the same if an armed attacker is approaching you, you have to move away from the line of fire, grab the weapon and turn it around so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the weapon and punch the attacker in the chest, turn the weapon away from the attacker's grasp, back off and keep the weapon aimed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash unless you're the Grand Master of Krav Maga.
The world traveler Ian Wright is making a guide to Europe's most filthy places.
A British traveler put his resistance and cocktail reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk planner and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking a euro coin, a handkerchief in the Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet washer and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a snowmeter to see for himself and to show the viewers what his tongue was pushing.
The experiment was made into a documentary film by Ian Wright about the inner power, and the results were surprising.
The thought of licking the toilet button on a train may sound disgusting, but in fact there are more bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his trip to Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about the strengthening of good gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but the evil mouth.
Ian Wright first became famous for his travel program, where he tested his gut's endurance by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The licking of the railway station hand tools and the toilet button undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: "Ever since I was a child, I have been quite careless about my health, sticking all sorts of things in my mouth, like dirt, worms, and dust".
In the movie, he really showed his reputation.
The border was only met in a dirty public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number of hands that are in contact is usually less than 60.
The border came across in a Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when the snowmeter measured 4,000 units  in freshly washed hands, the same number is less than 60.
Wright is adventuring with Valia in a documentary film produced by Ian Wright, tracing the power of the inner world, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in a bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
It's so disgusting, I really don't want to burn anything here".
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright  Traces of the Inner Force in collaboration with Valio.
From Valium, Wright received Valium Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut's good bacterial resistance and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the menu, juices and fresh produce division at Valio, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's fascinating to watch and at the same time tells us about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time trying to come up with something crazy, and we finally came up with the idea of asking Ian to come along".
Gastric health has become a global trend.
"Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
The document is an international trend in gut health, and we can provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our sense of humor!"
The film's director, Tom Hakala, adds: "I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had swallowed certain items we asked for, such as the Russian toilet that is also shown in the film.
Naturally, some of the items were easier for Ian to lick, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on tape".
In the 2015 SII survey, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular and 58% reported using at least occasionally products with lactic acid bacteria.
A troubled family destroyed a city-owned rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before they moved out.
The family left £50,000 worth of damage to the town to own the rental house after being evicted for terrorising the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple was forcibly removed from the apartment, the rental company's representatives reported in shock that the apartment was in a state of repair.
The walls were filled with openings, the floorboards were torn apart, the trash was spread on the floors, and the walls were painted with graffiti.
The couple have now moved in, and they're believed to be living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says: "This has been a nightmare for the people who live here, and no one should have to put up with this.
There's a lot to weigh in on, because the property is likely to be known as a less pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as the name suggests".
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time, and police said the family's horrors included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby victims, drug use and distribution, and loud shouting, quarreling, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, who signed the lease, was ordered to behave in an unsocial manner in June.
In several rooms of the house under the dumpster, old debris was found.
The house used to be a drug store, and the floorboards were torn down.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and police had to call the scene regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Authority evicted the couple for a forced trial this week after giving them an initial 11 weeks of extra time to move out voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction. They said their lives were hell on earth.
One neighbor says: "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been hard.
The police have been here an incredible number of times".
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been expelled".
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall Housing Authority's enforcement department, says the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were regularly called.
Trash and old toys were thrown on the wild wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own and family's conduct, as eviction is always the last resort for the Cornwall Housing Authority.
This case was very difficult because the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my task force, the police in Devon and Cornwall and the community who took part in the work and courageously offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbors and send a message that unsocial behaviour is not acceptable".
Fitzpatrick tells us that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their 20s.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction
Now, the housing workers must clean out the garbage from the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis, as well as blankets and other supplies, and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of a class B drug with intent to sell it.
He claimed the money was for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being displaced, Skeldon and her husband have reportedly moved into a private residence in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms were graffiti-painted.
Police say they're demanding evictions for tenants who violate the terms of the lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police says this eviction is a clear warning to tenants who are constantly challenging the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can do whatever they want without charges, as well as to those who suffer from this behavior", says Crow.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, shallow army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced a shock in their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane crashed to a staggeringly low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight that posed no threat to safety.
The scene shows the moment when tourists were forced to flee when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
The dramatic images show an army plane approaching near-touch on a sandy beach from sun-drenched tourists in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers understandably stood up in fear of the sound of the jet engines, which began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the photographers and video creators of the dramatic passing was Daniel Fernandes, who posted on social media, saying: "It passed the beach twice on a very low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling to the ground".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would crash on me".
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were shocked when the plane suddenly came into view and flew at an astoundingly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which was why the plane had to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke from nearby fires affected visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the fog and poor visibility caused by the fog, the pilot had to fly at such a low altitude.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exot's first half of the year results better than expected
The Social and Health Service of the Southern Caribbean (Exote) achieved a better result than planned in January-June of EUR 3.4 million.
The result of EXO was EUR 4,3 million in excess in the first half of the year.
The results were particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has led to the dismantling of institutional management.
The warranty was in effect for all operations.
This year, Exote is working to reduce the number of operations.
Exot shall cover the previously created deficit by surplus.
The remaining portion may be used to shorten lines and buy procedures for patients.
The full year's results are forecast to be EUR 4,6 million better than planned.
The Board of Exoto will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Forces officers took the oath of office in Immola
70 of the Border and Coast Guard Schools took the oath of office on Friday.
A military parade of Border and Coast Guard school cadets was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Forces Medical Course was held at the Armored Training Field.
The oath of office was administered by 70 deputies.
Special border guards are trained for the demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They're on duty 347 hours a day.
This year, 310 young people applied for the position of Special Surgeon.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Specialised icebreakers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The ceremony, which was held at the Veterans' Meeting, included five veterans of the Border Patrol during the war.
The average age of the people who were with her is now 90.
The oldest veterans of the service were born in 1918.
The crime reporting helps to investigate and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has had a Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit (RTA).
The unit's function is invisible to the outside.
The Hemme Police Unit has a total of four police officers in Lahore and Hemme Castle.
It's being pulled by a high-ranking officer stationed in the Gulf.
The head of the oversight is the Commissioner in Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinn.
They all work in civilian clothing.
The unit has demonstrated its reliability and its necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit is providing different reports to the other police.
It's not a problem, for example, it's gotten information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working practices
The establishment of the analytical units is the latest reform of the police work.
The goal has been to prevent crime, which means that the police will rarely go to the scene of the shooting until they receive an alarm.
The unit's collection and analysis of information helps to direct daily police operations to where they are most needed.
With the reform of police administration, one Crime Intelligence Centre was established in the country, with fewer than three national units and each police unit with its own Crime Intelligence Unit.
The PTR Centre, which is affiliated to the Central Crime Police, is responsible for national activities.
The PTR units are staffed by the Police, Customs and Border Protection Agency, as their name indicates.
RTAs, in turn, operate in areas allocated by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
Whereas an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's job is to know what is happening throughout the police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of your own institution, because that's what crime does.
The RTA unit has better basic police skills.
The unit uses its records, alert database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive crimes or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it's one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Every human being has his own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible in work, whether it's honest or criminal.
The way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it, the way you do it.
The number of police officers who are being investigated is the highest number of police officers.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees don't walk around the city with their heads up, but their work isn't entirely public.
The methods used by both the police and criminals are not mentioned, as this could lead to the development of their activities by professional criminals, thus preventing police crime prevention efforts.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they anticipate that they will pose a threat.
For example, a case like this was reported early in the summer, the way empty apartments were marked in home breaches.
The makers put a stick, a button or a tape on the outside door of the apartment to test whether the residents were actually traveling.
The preliminary examination shall be made public to at least the interested parties.
The analytics unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most sophisticated of the parties request a copy of the arbitration panel's minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time we go to the thieves, we'll go with our gloves on.
The case was interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppäs from the Häme Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola from the East Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of workers' rights.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The Commission therefore considers that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
National cooperation collects information from outside the institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl who was involved in a father-to-be murder was killed in Syria.
News reports say one of three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that Sultan was killed in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The sultan was 17 years old and his family said he was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"It is only hoped that this will serve as a warning example and testament to the people's understanding of the real risk of going to war zones - and that will cause people to abandon the decision to leave", Akunjee says.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East Asian schoolgirls boarded a plane that flew to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that the sultan had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had become a widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if he's elected.
Senate Democratic Chairman Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Republican Senators have not agreed to confirm Garland's nomination since Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose someone who is to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a phone call Thursday that he predicts Clinton's election of Garland "with great certainty".
Reid's informant later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether he intended to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "move the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid says the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are Donald Trump's "comrades" and "saviors".
He thinks Trump's not fit for office.
According to Treats , the naked calendar is as good for women as it is for men .
Treats is a collaboration with photographer David Bellemeren and is launching a 1970s-style, Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
Instead of public statistics, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nude-thinking magazine differs from the old-school Playboy magazine in that he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women".
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, can relentlessly enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify women", says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"I'm sure women want to be part of this project because it's going to be a beautiful work of art".
For example, those who want to use the calendar can post their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection under the heading "Not All Single Mid-Age Men", this claim is based on actual research.
According to YouGov, the much talked about new vinyl record is not a millennial boom, where millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but rather a middle-aged nostalgia.
The person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, 1824 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of fans to purchase records, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hide their emotions (56 % vs. 53 %) and enjoy being alone (69 % vs. 66 %).
But are YouGov's results accurate?
If this blog were a television news broadcast, a camera would follow me as I walk down Soho Street in a busy, unadorned gray jacket, and I would lift my hands, bend my hands into cups, and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out".
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its appeal and resilience as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises of private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialty record shops.
I'd probably ask the cameraman to stop the camera for a moment as I approach the men who visit these stores very close and try to observe them by assessing their age and character.
Stuart, 55, of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (who currently has two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (who currently has eight middle-aged men, one likely in her twenties) is on a meeting trip in London in the afternoon and spends his spare time exploring the supply of shops.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I guess I am", he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records".
These plates fill the walls of her living room, as you can see in the picture.
Part of the reason he's gotten so many albums and singles is because of his disposable income, and he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out and buy things he was young and broke that he had to sell again.
"I get a lot of late '60s and early '70s stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get it", she says.
He agrees that vinyl buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's my fault".
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit into the YouGov profile.
But he has noticed a new kind of influx of people who have been affected by the media hype, and these people have heard about vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"My discussions suggested that people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back", he says.
This could explain the vinyl-operated boom of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional significance of the tapes?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonika, they provide a comforting community for the like-minded.
Wez said some of the older customers were particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may be haunting some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar records means stability and reminds of the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or a material asset to get some sort of comfort", says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your thoughts out".
"We're like social workers!" cries Wez's coworker behind the record cover.
An ICM opinion poll in April revealed that almost 50% of vinyl album purchases in the previous month had not yet listened to the record.
The poll also found that 41 percent of vinyl record buyers own a CD player they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers don't own a CD player at all.
At this point in the news, I'd probably look serious while browsing the surface of the bossa nova collection.
The new vinyl release is also linked to the "pocket phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman for Sounds of the Universe (who at the time were three middle-aged men).
"A customer recently came to the store and said that he did not have a record player, but that he wanted to buy a Radiohead record so he could put it on his shelf", says Jonny.
"These are not very large, but they do exist.
They're more interested in material things than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just starting out".
The customer base is much more diverse in Fopp, which I'm going to be the next one to reach, and the company has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl records.
The clients include 70 couples, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is pleasing, although the mood is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the sound of jazz, the newest sex-thirsty synthesizer pop from Wild Beasts.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to tell the painful psychological trauma of being around someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppia for a few minutes, watching a variety of discount records.
He's more interested in watching than shopping.
He says his income is low, so he can't collect the records.
"They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to on the computer or otherwise, but the finesse of vinyl is"... he lets go of his delightful sigh and continues:
"I can't explain it, they're so unique".
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans, Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who imagine they're flipping their jeans, but instead they're just gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a moment, and I see a father and daughter who're thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairway with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of contemporary and classical music, the key records for any medium-sized collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because it's just an element of decoration and part of it is so high that it's not even reachable.
They're pure art vinyl.
But given that all the ways to get attention for these records could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search tour of Soho, there's hardly any reason to complain.
It is not surprising that the population group that is most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
Although I have studied the validity of YouGov's findings, at least in the recording industry, they do not exclude the large number of female record labels and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or work.
At least they're not spending their Thursday mornings in Berwick Street record shops, browsing records, and avoiding the 30-year-old TV producer who stares at the badly-aware middle-aged men in a scary way.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest-lived vertebrate  video report
Scientists say that the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest known ice shark was 272,512 years old, a female 5 centimeters long.
The French court rejected the application for the dismantling of the forestry shops
The French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants by placing thousands of refugees in jungle camps.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to dismantle 72 temporary shops set up for refugee camps, which sell people in the camps a variety of goods from tobacco to energy drinks and haircuts, and can buy tea at temporary restaurants for 50 cents or basic drinks for a few euros.
The Calais prefectural authorities claim that these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve risks of fire and hygiene.
The aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants were essential to the camp, as free meals provided by the government-backed organization and other bodies were not enough for the camp's growing population.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the prefect of Calais' concern "fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, camping grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants are of far greater importance than just providing food for people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, a nonprofit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unattended minors at the camp, who are the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address that requires the children's coffee shop to be kept.
According to a letter to the Guardian, closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in summer fire volumes, the population of the jungle cholera has risen to a record high of over 9,000.
Food prices in Finland are falling much faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply for the pleasure of consumers and the discomfort of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost 5% in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, they have fallen by 0.9%.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food prices have risen by one percent.
Over the past three years, food prices have fallen the second most in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels.
In comparison, only in the UK have food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are from an article by Ilkka Lehtisen, Head of Development at the Statistics Centre, published in the blog Info & Trendit.
The paper compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the overall trend in consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to 1994 levels.
It was a very alarming situation.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership brought us", says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, and then food became cheaper year after year.
The price is now weighed down by Russian food import bans that have hampered food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price decline.
The big retailers S Group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
The consumer has seen the price competition as the most prominent advertising campaign.
Finland is still not a food hub, despite the large decline in food prices.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with similar wages to Finland.
According to the newspaper, the value added tax has a significant impact on the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the comparative countries had the same VAT rate, the same countries would sell the cheapest food in Finland at a third rate.
The paper translated Finland into Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the countries of the comparison were seven, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition", writes Lehtinen.
The newspaper notes that its calculations of VAT as a percentage are indicative.
School ain 't what it used to be .
A return to school may notice a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be implemented at the beginning of the term in all primary schools.
It is the guideline for all schools in Finland.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official goals.
The new guidelines have been in the works for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, they're giving up teaching fine writing and instead starting to practice coding in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade and social studies in the fourth grade.
The main change, however, is the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived spine found in the world, a shark can live up to 400 years.
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), which is well-known, does not reach sexual maturity until 150 years of age.
It may live another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the wild, it is only surpassed by the Icelandic pear, whose oldest known individual is dated 507 years old.
Greenland shark swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females can stretch dogs longer, reaching up to over five centimeters.
Because the rate of growth is slow, only about an inch a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified the adult icefish from 28 females that had been caught by the fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiation exposure of the eye lenses.
The average life span of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazonian fish, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice cubes reach sexual maturity at just over four centimeters, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockman fired nearly 300 salesmen .
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off by Stockmann, a department store company.
The joint ventures, which were in trouble, closed in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of some 300 jobs, most of which will be laid off", Stockmann said in a statement.
It states that the number of sellers of warehouses will not be reduced in order to avoid suffering from customer service.
In addition, some 80 support staff are offered new sales jobs.
Stockmann's negotiations involved some 3 000 workers.
At the time of their introduction, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in manpower will aim at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme with a target of EUR 50 million in savings this year.
The reason for this is Stockmann's difficulty in making a profit from the goods store.
Although the Group's operating profit improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the goods trade is still losing.
According to Stockmann's CEO Lauri Veijalaisen, the sales in the warehouses have not reached the company's objectives.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the assessment of the impact of the measures on the environment.
The second quarter's performance improvement was mainly due to the success of the Lindex clothing chain.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter revenue and earnings.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating profit was a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating income is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the northern hemisphere with temperatures below 20 degrees across the country.
The centre of low pressure over northern Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, reports HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
It's also raining in the central part of the country, but it's warmer in the south.
The temperature is not very summery anymore, as the country's mercury levels are below 20 degrees.
In the northern rainy areas, it'll be 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya's athletic team is fueled by a doping scandal, a strange explanation for a coach's deception.
Kenyan general-sport coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah had performed as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform at is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenyan national team manager Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had taken a sample of Rotichin in a surprise test.
Doping officials have been to Anzrahi to report the incident.
I told him Anzrah was sent home because he "crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, even signed documents.
We cannot tolerate this kind of behavior", Kip Keino, president of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympics are starting on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that very moment.
It's still unclear if the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at last year's World Championships and is already the Rio winner.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan national team claimed that Anzrah had acquired an athlete's credit card only to get free meals in the village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for testing.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he feared it would be revealed", the source said.
Where is everybody?
The Rio General Stadium is ruining its void
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching the Olympics.
On Friday, the Rio Games began with a competition for the world's top sports medals, but the world's top teams were able to showcase their skills to a stunningly empty audience.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day of matches were sold and 65% of the tickets for the evening matches.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was crowded with cheering crowds.
Tickets to the finals are sold out in Rio.
The number of spectators at the Rio Olympics has been highlighted even before the Olympics.
For example, rugby, melon, and riding have seen thousands of empty benches.
When Brazil's medal-winning teams Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach soccer in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the viewership was filled.
After the Brazilian double, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seat crowd was only about 30 percent full.
At least the reason for the bad performance is that Brazil, struggling economically, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to football-savvy Brazilians.
Even the first match of the Brazilian national football team, however, was not allowed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, the race organisers' spokesman, said over the weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold by then, a significantly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell", Andrada told Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have fluctuated from about nine euros to over one thousand euros for the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
The stadium in Rio had enough empty seats in the morning.
Even beach soccer on the sands of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
Jukka Central competed in London in 2012.
I've had enough people with the papers.
A new way to protect nature - to get land rights
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to the conservation of nature by new means.
The Foundation, which was set up last year, is acquiring ecologically important natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and entities can redeem land rights in cash.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be purchased for a fee.
The holder shall be granted a right of veto for a block of 187 square metres, which means that in practice, each holder does not need approval if the land use is to be changed.
The holding rights may also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be inherited or given as a gift.
No need to go carrying flags or chaining yourself somewhere to protect nature", explains Juha Leviägas, who acquired the management rights for his company.
The acquirers of the management licence receive accurate location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website lists the names of the acquirers of the rights in the same map as the block of land.
Leviäkangas sees its conservation project as a risk only if the Foundation changes its activities from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a public benefit foundation dedicated to promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but that shouldn't be possible.
The Helsinki Foundation's Guardian project is based on the protection of natural areas in a way that they remain intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of shareholdings, but the Foundation has its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims to move beyond Finland's borders and plans to buy land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Mall from 13 to 19 August.
The worst torment of big cities is for bicycle thieves. Look at your home.
Bicycle thieves torture Turku worse than any other major city in Finland.
This year, more wheels were stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bike thefts reported to the police, the Helsinki Gazette found out how many bicycles and parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January and August this year, per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to the fortune, Helsinki, Oulu and the Gulf rose to the top.
According to police, four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 residents occurred.
In Espoo and Kouvolas, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
I mean, that's a big difference.
"In other cities, the number of burglaries relative to population is double", describes Police Commissioner Tommi Reen.
The police in the city are wondering why the city is at the top of the list.
It's extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in the market than anywhere else.
I don't have the answer to that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by the amount of cycling in the city and the number of wheels at all", reflects Chief Officer Teemu Äikäs.
The police authorities, Tommi Reen, have long expected Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top.
The number of bike thefts is largely dependent on which cities are the study and cycling cities.
There's a narrow center in the market, short distances, and plenty of wheels for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a very special city, with city centers far apart and bicycles not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
In Finland, the number of bike thefts in January and August was slightly lower than in the same period last year.
There's no reason to be so happy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts a year.
That's 50 to 60 dollars a day, and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 bicycles a year.
"It's a lot of money", Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, since only a small percentage of victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime of bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are ever reported.
A typical known bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in the act.
"Cases are also being investigated in other cases, such as when stolen wheels can be found in a drug case", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly in the course of their own work or in the course of a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He says that wheels are stolen from, for example, shopping malls' wheelbases, courtyards, warehouses and wheelbases, or virtually anywhere they are usually stored.
The most stolen bikes in the world are the Jopoes, like in previous years.
The U-Lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
For example, some thieves take a bicycle for short-term use, but a large proportion of stolen bicycles end up being sold online.
They'll stay in the home market.
"At least the police have not learned that stolen wheels are rarely exported", says Reen.
The police say the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some of you may have doubts.
The buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, for he may be guilty of concealment or breach.
"The alarm bells should ring if a good bike is sold at a discount", says Reen.
Special librarian Severi Hirvi carries his colorful knife for the protection of the Kallion Library in Helsinki every day of his working life.
He has had five bicycles, but none stolen, says Hirvi. "Never taken, but he's a good monk".
"Maybe this isn't so much a thief's attraction, it may not have any hysterical value", reflects the Helsinki Deer.
A quick-selling Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Helsinki's Kallio, locked his bicycle in a small U-lock.
Now the bike is pushed against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike to something solid, like a wheelbarrow.
"It's a lot to think about because this bike is the most expensive thing I ever owned", says a student in Helsinki about his white bike, which cost about five hundred euros a hull alone.
"My friends keep telling me the wheels have been taken".
"Somehow bad wheels, like those back-to-back Jopoes".
The vigilante himself was stolen a bicycle from the home company's yard a year ago.
The wheel had been unlocked, though, so Valve was able to wait for it to be seized.
Under 15 for crimes they're responsible for?
Helsinki is testing the US-based rivals
In Helsinki, a so-called 'equal-law' team is being set up to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the experiment was applied to those under 15 years of age who are now free of criminal liability.
The jury is missing the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that a jury of your peers discuss what happened with the perpetrator and issue a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator may join a jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to a family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Tommi Laitio, director of the Youth Action, says the model is not rigid.
We have other mediation models that are used in conjunction with each other.
"Everything is directed to a more responsible direction of youth activities so that everyone does not get ruined by the first mistake", says the Act.
The equivalent body has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young person does not get in front of an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with approximately his or her peers.
The model has been tested once.
According to the service designer Iikka Lovio, who supervised the experiment, the abuse was successfully solved.
Especially the first crimes of children under 15 may not have been addressed at all.
"It has been a message that you continue on the path you choose", Lovio says.
The Ombudsman's Office is part of the Migrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are being offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received it to see the draft.
According to the paper, an open letter was sent to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to go to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, along with his indifference, incompetence and record-breaking disfavor, threaten to cause a vote-off for Democrats in this election", the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congressional elections can stop Republicans from drowning the Trump-decorated anchor in their necks.
The letter said the decision shouldn't be difficult because Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent out within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians such as Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is clearly Trump-opposing Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have exhibited dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials in the country announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to American families with children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policies on Thursday night.
I was running for president to make sure the American economy worked out for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends", Clinton said in her speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases for the rich and in part by private money.
The construction program is a hand-training program for American dunes who suffer from the factories' move to cheap labor lands.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We're a building crew. We have to go back to building!
Clinton said that.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the status of working-class families.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, by the way, when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax fugitive, it has to pay exit tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the free trade agreement he once supported.
"As president, I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to speculation in the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed tax cut has been described by Clinton as "Trump's pigtail".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was herself the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of small businesses whose bills Trump has left unpaid and clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton whispered.
The following are the number of viewers in Rio: The Finnish people are not tied to the boxes, but the mobile app is interesting
Sports games are usually shown in TV viewer statistics as the sharpest mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached a record-setting audience.
Once, the races have been held at the edge of the boards by at least 12% of the population: on Tuesday night, the swimming was watched by 615,000 people on the Olympic Channel on TV2.
For comparison: the EM World Cups last month attracted almost 800 000 viewers at a time on TV2 and the EM World Cups in football attracted another million.
So far, the Olympics have been dominated by Sunday night cycling and the fifth-day opening of the broadcast, both of which reached an audience of nearly half a million on the Olympic Channel at a time.
General Manager Panu Pokkinen of Yle Sports is pleased with the audience and reminds that for the first time, the spectators will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns are watching the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We're happy with the number of TV viewers who are actually going to the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports events for which Yle has owned a full channel.
When the show is on 24 hours a day, and the viewership is 20,000 to 500,000, that's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly due to the time difference - a large part of Rio's racing broadcasts are in Finland at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone now considers it a lack of interest - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening games, interest would have jumped upwards with it.
Furthermore, public sports are just beginning, as are other Finnish sports of interest: sailing and horse riding.
The initial viewership has been close to what Pokki said.
When the sport starts, the numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the early days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already on the way to 200,000 downloads.
"We'll get the network viewership figures later", Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as desirably for all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has arrived and the error has been corrected.
The Rio Arena has been delayed and other minor technical problems at the beginning.
The applications have been updated and should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are seen on the Yle Canal and Arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and Yle Talk broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympians are not only perhaps the busiest Yleu ever, but also the last to be followed only from Yleu's channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be available on both Yale and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is the lake of the Sun, which is 95.3 metres deep on the island of Kristilla.
It could be deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving instructor, found a 20-square-foot [20 m] weight on the cross, which the dive computer measured to a depth of 104 feet.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Centre tried in vain to confirm the observation by sounding a bell.
The method may not be found at a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 m) and Suvas Water (90 m).
The Saimaa, Second Water and Main Lake are more than 80 metres in length.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sunflower.
The bottom of Lake Inari has not been mapped accurately.
"There might well be unknown depths", Kannela reflects.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean latitude, it's the Great Lakes, 23 meters.
So your sun will not be among the ten deepest, and the spring water is farther from the edge.
Correction, August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: The last paragraph corrected where the deepest lakes in the mid-latitude were wrong.
The tax rate is flattering: the tax rate for pensioners is still tightening
The tax rate for pensioners remains more stringent than for employees.
Ihalainen says that the disadvantage was highlighted under parliamentary votes and that pensioners were promised equal taxation to payroll.
The Government's proposal does not contain such a statement.
We think it should definitely be in there.
The promises made should be kept after the election, he told Western Media.
Earlier this year, wage earners received a reduction in earnings, which eased their tax burden.
The issue was heated in the House by opposition representatives who were bemoaning the then Finance Minister Alexander Stubby (co.) about the election promises.
Buying power is secure, it's not growing
The Commission considers that the Commission's proposal to extend the exemption from tax to the State aid granted to the State in the form of a reduction in the amount of the aid granted to the State in the form of a reduction in the amount of the aid granted to the State.
He says that tax cuts have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's insecurities.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo about the desire to respect the competition agreement reached during the difficult times.
He says that keeping a deal is important to credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It is done by the social partners, so it should not be questioned.
It will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of workers' rights.
Ihalainen urges the government to tackle longterm unemployment in budgetary conflicts, at least to halt its growth.
The number of longterm unemployed in June was about 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will be elusive.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social decline in the future.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to exercise vigilance and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
While there is no reason for Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand to cancel their trip due to the explosions, the embassy's guidelines on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish tourist season in Thailand is the turn of the year.
Most Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has sought to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at this time.
Overall, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the perpetrator
Westphalen said there's no information yet on who carried out the attacks.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in divided society in Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The bill passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In one country, people were arrested for speaking out against the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, ethnic and national conflict is being waged over Muslim populations, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
However, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations in the past.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The impact on the course of the day will be such that the authorities will be extremely strict about security.
Thai police: The attacks are not international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and were different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been shut down, according to the AP, Thailand's police news agency.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the past 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in popular tourist destinations such as Phuket and Hua Hin.
At the popular tourist destination of Finland, Phuket, four bombs exploded in the night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngas, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
The popular tourist destination Hua Hin has been hit by four bombs, according to local authorities, both yesterday and today.
In each of the twin bombings, at least one person was killed.
In addition, in the southern Thai village of Surat Than and the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in both.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Many tourists also know Surat Thani, which is the gateway to the holiday islands of Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The assailant is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the head of Thailand's ruling military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks has not yet been identified.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We can't get people to panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Minister of Security, at least Hua Hin and Tran's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the attackers were intended to destroy the country's tourism industry because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to exercise vigilance and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the authorities' instructions.
The Finns who intend to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the nighttime attacks in Finland and their victims.
We've been able to get a little more information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
In the last attack on Hua Hin, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded near the famous watch tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The governor of Surat Than said the bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
The strike killed a city employee.
At least one person is injured.
The police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Biles won the women's quadruple sculls.
The United States' Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russia's Aliya Mustafina was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Rio Games for breeding championships in the floor, jump and pole vault.
Biles has been a master of women's gymnastics for the past few years.
He's won eight individual world championships in three years.
He has won the championship of the four-man event and the downhill event three times in a row, and the last and second year of the pole vault.
With the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The best World Cup medals in Biles are the jump and the jump.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Sky has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think there will be any more miracles", said Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some 20 years.
An experienced businessman has witnessed many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year, the bombing in Bangkok.
If these two have not driven out tourists before, this one hardly has.
The office of the Hoovila company is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
The housekeeper heard the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about 9:00 local time and said he shouldn't come to the office.
The official said that both the beach and the main road on Bangla Road were completely closed early this morning due to the attacks.
A lot of my local employees came to work this morning in the usual way.
They thought the road signs were set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to a Friday holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere in Patong was calm, and traffic on the main street was allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many on the beach had never even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 a.m. Thai time, traffic in Patong had returned to normal and most shops had opened.
According to the site, the explosion was quite small, says Huovila, a visitor to the site.
Later, the car in question was seen at the Crown Supper in Jouxholm.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The police spotted two identifiable men hiding in a nearby six-room apartment.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of operating a motor vehicle, stealing and causing grievous bodily harm.
The police are grateful for any leads.
Research Director on the changes in leadership in Russia: Clearly moving away
Russia's most senior leadership change in years came on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired its chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino, of Estonian descent.
He's a former diplomat who served as Ivanov's second in command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that redirecting managerial functions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to stop people from claiming power independently of the president.
According to Kangaspur, it's also possible that Ivanov has been involved in a fight with other executives or screwed up.
The station is closed to Ivanov.
Ivanov, who is now part of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special environmental and transportation duties.
In a video of the state media, Putin declared the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace him with the "Vino", Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear demise.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's priority list.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people in Russia at the height of its power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have been exchanged in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnönimy of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than Ivanov's successors is that Putin changes his neighbors to younger ones.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in their retreat in Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the town of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars that took them to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of Manbij, an important city for the Islamic State, last week.
But it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Previously on 7:30 p.m.: We had previously misrepresented civilians fleeing the city, in fact ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of Interior's document disclosure line is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's line on the publication of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The voter tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authorities' own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior has previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the State Council Office and that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Minister's communications director tells STT that the Ministry has seen a need to reform its practices.
The last Olympics for Usain Bolt are starting in Rio.
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time in a value-added race.
He was offended from the start by his backpack and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic trials.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key", Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included light-skinned sambatans and fan-turned reporters.
The burden surrounding Bolt underscores that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when general sport has struggled with doping scandals and growing interest.
Bolt's last Olympic loss came in Athens in 2004, when he ran 21.05 in the 200-meter dash.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promising man who was slowed down by injuries and a lazy training position.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, breaking the world record and ending the competition's confidence with a time of 9.69.
This is harder .
A year later, at the Berlin World Championships, Bolt reached his career high in clock measurement.
The world records, set in Berlin at 9,58 metres and 19,19 metres, are still in place.
Riossa Bolt has announced his ambition to set the world record in the 200 meters and 19 seconds under, but no one believes it will be achieved except Bolt himself.
The 100th most challenging Bolt is the 2004 Athens Olympic 100th Justin Gatlin.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated an American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has never lost a single final of the Beijing Games since he took office, if he's ever made it.
In the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, Bolti was left out of the race because of a cheating accident.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Uranus' final goal line is Bolt's next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm under, I remind myself: this year, I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, the state news agency, the 18-year-old Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
A sample of Chinese drug user Chen Xiny was found to contain prohibited substances.
I also suspect Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was deported for doping on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with evidence of an epo-hormone.
She placed fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese woman has taken her doping case to the CAS of the International Court of Sports Appeals.
Xinhua reports that a sample taken by Xiny on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping allegations in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female bodybuilder Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of an epo-hormone.
Kenya has been granted a visa to return to the home of a sports coach from Rio for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test situation and had given doping evidence in his favor.
According to media reports, the suspect is Kenyan sprint trainer John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rothschild's race slip.
Nothing stops Phelps from making history .
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the American Michael Phelps swam the 200-meter dash in his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to win the same Olympic gold in four consecutive Games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mix, ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun. I'm having a laugh at the BBC Olympic science commentator Helen Skelton in the Sunday Evening Post short interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (pictured) on Monday is the most read story on the Sunday Times website this week.
Next up is the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much of a stressor if there is a small compliment in the Somme or British press on his revealing and special outfits.
TV is visual media, he's insisting.
Skelton is wearing high-heeled shoes and a short-heeled dress that is certainly at least enough exposure to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
But there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small bags are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to tune in and maybe even surprise you, but he's insisting he doesn't want to be in the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and we need to focus on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the elevator reaching Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is fine with me, Skelton's fart.
You know what? I'm gonna...
It's a dish out of nowhere when it comes to dressing.
I'm a little bit amused if this one hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests on terrorism charges.
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people on terrorism charges.
Police made the arrests in connection with the race's security.
Police made five other arrests in connection with the same incident and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the terrorism detainees are members of the same group whose members were arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to be connected to the Islamic State.
The detainees were reportedly inciting violence on social media.
The messages calling for violence were circulated on, among other things, the recommended WhatsApp service.
The Rio Games are being held in the hands of 85,000 police officers.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their opening match of the Rio Basketball Tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball court and closed it to the public.
Police allowed the public inside after they had controlled the package.
This was the third time in Rio's Olympic history that police have conducted a controlled explosive.
Police have closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The audience got in after the police had controlled the package.
The crowd didn't stop watching the game until the start of the game because the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package that was found in their possession.
The police blew up the package and only then let it into the audience hall.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race in a sleepy way.
With two losses, Spain, who started the race, beat Nigeria by 96-87.
In the previous two games, Spain won silver.
Police have conducted a controlled explosive operation for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police detonated a suspicious find near the destination of a road cycling event was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their opening match of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty spectators.
The Argentine lady blew up the Traitor Siren . The Finnish man was planning a protest .
The wind at Cheater-Siren was a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The Traitor-Sire wind was strong on Thursday.
An Argentine lady blew the Traitor Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted to breach.
He got stuck in a car accident, and the others ran away, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told us.
The athlete has been considering a protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get my compensation, Cheater-Sire said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last minute, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish man was left in the car with a car on his way to seat 27.
In total, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in London is eighth.
The crash didn't really affect the pain.
Friday's a big day, so we're racing for the 10th-12th.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first report, the Traitor-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says prolong life
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his life is prolonged.
And sometimes things that a person cannot control themselves can bring him years to live.
These include the tendency to be overweight or obese.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't always have to even bother. Just pick up a milkman.
The long-standing mystery has been solved through a variety of investigations.
The Medical Daily has released seven of the strangest findings.
Science says all these things could add years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee intake has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer' s and Parkinson' s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death", especially for neurological or heart disease.
Studies, again, speak for alcohol, showing that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental use can extend a person's life by up to six years, says one study.
The argument is that this prevents the spread of infections.
They, in turn, can promote the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found that laughter affected a person's life span.
The seven-year project was followed by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test.
Gender, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
Besides, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have an extra year of life, he must also have an orgasm.
I'm sure professionalism will bring you more years, and there's no denying that.
However, longevity does not require absolute diligence.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a large butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to a low mortality rate.
Whether it's an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he's more likely to live longer than the average bottleneck.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that longevity is a result of a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to seek recognition, such as a Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 found that those who shop daily are less likely to shop as parents.
This is because running a concrete store reduces loneliness.
It has been shown to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause death.
So, if you count your credit card out of your hand, then online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk driver who was a goddamn drunk collided with a truck .
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car accident occurred in the Kosk of Varsina-Finland.
The accident happened in Kosk, Koskenti and Sorvaston on Friday at 9:00 p.m.
The truck was heading towards Forssa when the passenger car came to the same road, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was parked on the side of the road after the collision, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car went up the aisle and then over the aisle to the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 and was driving a private car was crushed by a car.
The rescue service pulled the injured driver out of the car and took him to the Central University Hospital in Turin for treatment.
The woman's breathing test was 2.02 promile.
He's under suspicion of driving under the influence.
The post office sent the wrong city with the card.
The list of exit cards of Salon K-Citymarket was incomplete because the postal service had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjo.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernion, was shopping for a set of discharge cards at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages on the freight lines because the Post delivered our cargo to the Wall Street!
We'll get more when the mail gets the load delivered!
So unless there's a traffic jam in the lawn, the sign says.
The company's flag is associated with the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The Post will always have grass cutters until the end of August.
Haltian thought the sign was mostly funny, and he decided to share it on social media.
I was so impressed with the updates.
The media has been on the phone all the time, and the attention this has brought to the matter is incredible, Halti wonders.
Last Friday night, Halti's update was shared on Facebook by over 700 people.
Haltia got her favorite stuff stuck in a bag of candy, even though a few of the cans were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the transport services business of Postal Enterprises, apologized to Ilta-Sanom for the damage.
The fact is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (The River of the Plains) and we didn't go to the third stage (The Hall) anymore, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first thing that came to the news was the Evening News.
Teja Halti wasn't mad at the sign because she found all her own scissors in the selection.
Lotta Backlund, who weighed 30 pounds, posted a photo of her change.
The comic book producer has lost tens of pounds since the birth of her baby.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a photo of the couple's change on Instagram on Friday.
Last spring, Lotta was on a skirt and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in the year 2014.
Comedian, television producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss career back in 2009.
She's a total lifestyle change and she's lost a little, quietly, 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lot has changed over the years.
Backlund's before and after photographer has collected a number of appreciative comments from national lifeguards.
You are so beautiful.
We're on the same road, motivation is strong!
Pija Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were all involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm from your pictures, as I myself go to heaven on the same journey, another tells me.
Last spring, Lot lost the last few pounds on the Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Evening Post that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then 10 pounds.
In three months of hard work, I finally lost five pounds.
The family of the woman murdered in Lovice wishes:
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Lviv hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered by donating to a police documentation.
The Sipoon Veterinary Medical Center has released a Facebook update to express the wishes of the victim's family about the donations to the police.
The publication reports that the victim had worked as a substitute in Sipo's veterinary practice and also completed her nursing training there.
The vet's office reminds me of a woman with touching words.
He's cheerful, smart, with a sense of humor, and he's not afraid of work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the donation funds will go entirely to police departments, primarily for the purchase of security.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Lovisa was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors told the Evening News that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and cocks.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked by police dog Börje, who was fatally injured in the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal ruled that Post had infringed the Equality Act.
The postal service had no right to withhold the wages of employees who refused to familiarize themselves with the hired worker, the Kanta-Häme Court of Appeal ruled.
The Court of Appeal ordered Post to pay the employee the majority of the remuneration and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
The judgment stated that Posti could have withheld only a proportion of the employee's salary corresponding to the employee's share of the day's work.
The appellant submits that the employee was placed in a more disadvantaged position because of his trade union activities, which was contrary to the Equality Act.
The worker had complied with the PAU's organizational decision to ban the introduction of the postal and logistics union.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU decided that Post employees should not contact the employees who broke the strike.
People's News first reported the incident.
Turkey returning to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to a democratic and human rights-respecting development path, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (French) in their reply to the Journalists' Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The press association had earlier asked Sipil and Soin in a letter to express their concerns about freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini emphasize the importance of freedom of the press and expression in Turkey, as Finland has repeatedly stressed.
Putin has removed the head of his administration from power .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin has said.
The Soviet Union's Communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will take the place.
Ms. Saino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
Vinayos will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a close associate of Putin, will be transferred to special environmental and transportation duties, according to a Kremlin statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer and proposed to replace him with the "Vino", reports Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev was elected president.
Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2011 before Putin was re-elected president in 2012.
The BBC Man U's giant prize for gambling won't be seen at the Premier League opening.
The world record holder for the football transfer will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed England.
Manchester United giant Paul Pogba is banned from the game as ManU opens their season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba a €105 million loan to Juventus in Italy, according to the British media.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game as he was banned from Juventus.
He got two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it's gonna be a one-game suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA has told the BBC.
Pogba's next match is in round two of the league on August 19th, when ManU will face Southampton.
Flow's madness of magnitude is a virtue.
The precise criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival's status as an internationally respected event, with the world's leading artists.
Flow Festival is starting on Friday in Helsinki.
Party writers have typically expressed themselves in self-taught dress.
One of the main performers on the scene this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area will be decorated with art installations and sculptures.
"It's never been enough for us to just have a headboard and a beer tent", says the event's artistic director, Toomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in Helsinki's Suvi Bay, has grown from a small block party to an event attended by tens of thousands of visitors.
The key to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves want to go to?
It's kind of weird in the events industry to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act according to the authorities' regulations, says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out this year.
The aim was to increase the number of visitors last year by 70,000 by 5,000.
This year's festivals will also see a number of interesting local and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visits is a good thing, because you have to finance the work somehow.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like cattle rustling in a vast lane.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been amplified over the past 13 years by 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurants and bars in the partly artificial area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance halls, this year's venue will be a 15,000-person tent.
The Rock admits that the event could be more simply realized.
I may be a little bit of a big-ass, but we've managed to keep Flow's spirit alive.
If it's lost, this is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for Kalli is that even great visions are now practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, activities were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the holding company operating Flow had a turnover of around EUR 6 million.
It can produce "crisis things", such as the construction of that 100-foot-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in self-stamped dress.
Alongside the music scene, we can also talk about a community of trending young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out, above all else, in content.
Yet, fashion also fits Flow's values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main performers is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop, rap and soul.
According to Rock, Iggy was booed because this is probably the last time you'll see him perform in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is a hell of a good one, and he's done some hell of a lot of shows over the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the bushes.
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night local time.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bomb was apparently hidden in a flower bed and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
From 1989 onward, wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a much talked about picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't look good, you can watch it from here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said the bomb exploded near the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bar squares, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one of them died.
We don't know how many people were injured.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, a popular destination for Finns.
No one is reported to have died.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one person was killed and three wounded.
And in the city of Trang, there was one bomb.
Police said they had discovered at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet exploded.
The Thai authorities say that the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces that are not satisfied with the Thai military leadership's actions.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been increasingly involved in the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, the paratroopers are not called to combat until several months after taking the oath of allegiance, reports the Central Finn.
According to the head of training for the Armed Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnisen, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat, for example, among the paramilitaries who serve for 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the head of training, the first assignment is to the reserves of the reserve forces.
"No one in the reserves or in the reserves is assigned to a mission without the training they need", Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it was revealed that the Defense Force will begin training its paratroopers for immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units may be used for military operations as needed during the training of paratroopers.
Pamela Tola was given a huge amount of money for her home tax.
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, director Pauli Waroma, have won a penalty for the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The two-storey detached house had a retail price of EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious humidity problem was discovered in the house, which caused a health-damaging microbial growth site.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a disposable property in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss of EUR 198 000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price cut from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the plaintiff's and the court's cases.
The court ruled on the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal ordering the seller to pay a discount of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller has to pay the couple's legal and settlement costs totalling EUR 47 344.
The court granted a slight price reduction because some of the need for repairs had already been known to buyers when the housing was sold.
However, the Court of Justice held that the construction errors were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
So , look for a good home .
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a comfortable home because they did not want to start repairs.
He had the impression that the building was in good condition and was in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the inspection report were not inconvenient.
The risk and inconvenience mentioned in the land survey report were ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and meltwater along the cliffs.
However, it was not clear from the discussions that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that rainwater from the rock might have to be diverted slightly within a few years.
The transaction was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the humidity problems in the apartment were far more serious than previously thought.
During inspections in 2012 and 2013, the site was found to contain microbes, which the Witnesses said were caused by both rocky rainwater and capillary uplift.
The inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could have entered the interior through the porch.
Over-the-counter, hypoglycemic, or hypoglycemic, was found in samples of siding in the household, basement stairwell, living room window frames and basement laundry room.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also disputeed whether the extension of the building was contrary to the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the Espoo City's decision to make changes to the condominium prior to the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though proper permits had not yet been issued.
However, home issues were a key issue in the court case.
According to the Court, the buyer could, on the basis of the information obtained from the seller before the transaction, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no immediate need for substantial repairs.
The Court of Justice found that Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out the usual wider examination.
The buyer has not failed to comply with the deposit obligation, the court said in its judgment.
A horrific record-keeping: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - including Finns -
In a recent article in Dagens Nyheter, reporter Christopher Andersson writes that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilm records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards are from the Nazi race agency.
The Bureau of Race was under the command of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of even larger numbers of women who were expected to be able to give birth to up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women were given gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The Office of Race Research investigated women's background, including through research of church books.
The purpose was to make sure there were no Jews among the women.
Women also had to be willing to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give the Bureau of Race Records a handwritten life cycle and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Office wanted assurances that the women were "child-loving", "spend-saving", and "good national socialists", who spoke German well.
Women who failed to meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesmaids of SS men.
The case does not mention the fate of the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside.
Lebensborn families provide for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, reports the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting the birth of children.
The German Mother's Medal was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum says.
As the sixth of the Traitor-Sire, the Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the first leg of the Finnjolli day sailing event at the Rio Olympics, but was knocked out in the second leg of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the second start failed to place him at 14.
The Wind Betrayer-Sire fought off the RSX Day Departures in 17th and 3rd places.
In the overall standings, Cheater Siren is sixth.
In the 470th grade, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening day.
In the overall standings, the Lindgrens are in 19th place.
The recording of the Satellite's body was made a couple of hours into the night: "I was so in a corner".
Jari Brillanpää has been one of Finland's favorite artists for over 20 years.
Having gone from a cruise ship barman to the king of tangok in 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and a star of dance clubs and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to climb and is currently on a high climb.
The book, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of her favorite singer Jari Brlanpää - Paljaana, was released today.
In the book, Bridgehead tells of his life and career, for better or worse.
His career rose to a total boost when he won the crown of the Tang Dynasty at the Tang Market in 1995.
At the race, the bridgehead sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a piece for the bridge at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen had arranged into a slightly different shape.
The song "Saturn" became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go according to plan: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible cramp and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so upset!
The bridgehead is in the book.
If you had a hit recording, you wouldn't know it was a pop song.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to be perfect and top-notch all the time.
The second incident in the book about the man's most popular verses happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Brillanpää divorced his then-partner and the case eventually ended with the lyrics of You Deserve Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics that Sara Törmämäs had ordered were not what Bröndby had hoped.
Bridget had imagined that she was making a record that told the true story of her own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were based on the news of the 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper's news report said that Jarin and his ex-girlfriend had divorced because of excessive partying and alcohol abuse, but Jarin said that it was a complete hoax and not true.
Jari, according to the book, was furious about the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually he decided to sing it, and that's fine.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of voters supported the split and 48% would have remained in the Union, despite the fact that the opinion polls of the voting week predicted the opposite outcome.
The UK economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their position to remain in the EU.
No reputable research institution or university has spoken out in favor of the divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers have expressed disagreement with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign "It's the economy, stupid" was thrown into the garbage can in the UK's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics is looking at the answers to the Brexit disaster from the professional community.
The typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the reasons economists have for losing their position in the economy is that people don't understand economics.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, so it is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real UK.
Many also have the idea that a decrease in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it would boost the export industry.
The Commission considers that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus among economists was insufficiently high.
They were particularly irritated by the BBC's fairness, which gave as much room to economists who favored EU differences as to the overwhelming majority representing only a few percent of the Economic Committee.
The anti-EU press was not interested in commenting on the consequences of the divorce by the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic literature bodies.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they didn't care because economists represent an elite with whom voters don't think they have a common interest.
The academics of big cities like the Economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is an economy too.
The main argument for the Brexit vote was immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant cuts through your hospital, an immigrant exploits you.
These arguments are valid.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center's waiting room is full of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't have them?
Every school has immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they were thrown out?
Every town has foreigners.
How much more space would the Aborigines have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They cover jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists were unable to answer them, and if they did, their answers were not visible.
Economists have failed to explain that immigrants have made Britain more employable, less well-being-centered and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are the net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund was set aside for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish firm Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that the Aberdeen plan was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan B, or the pro-EU split, was prepared for a victory a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their funds out of the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have adequate liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily listing of real estate funds that the news touched on.
The old man said the normal rate would be 15 to 20 percent.
The value of the fund at the time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is around £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open-ended real estate funds, Vanhanen says, of all the open-ended real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even less.
The real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the pro-EU divide camp won, Europe went to hell.
However, the two weeks of voting in the real estate market were rather quiet, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he assessed that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they plundered the situation and took the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was directly compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This is making investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors became nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors one by one.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash it had raised, but it also ended up freezing its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually close the deal, they changed the pricing down.
In practice, he gave investors time to consider whether it was worthwhile to panic-out the money.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of them cancelled the announcement.
Since then, the market has been fairly stable, and now for a couple of weeks it has been very calm, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such debasement in Aberdeen's Manner European Funds.
But there were a lot of questions.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
The old man said that the closure of the real estate fund transactions received unreasonable attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK real estate.
Aberdeen closed for six days and the company sold less than 10 properties out of 80 in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might be holding its fund closed for the second half of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem "worse" for Aberdeen.
The main questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even opened up new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen notes.
The exchange rate between the red and the dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and the market is experiencing a 15% drop in sales compared to the period before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% less.
There are many willing buyers, says the Old Man.
Brexit has had a negative impact on the London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation didn't look very strange.
But on the fourth day, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
I thought that was the strength of your head.
I realized this is going to be a plan B thing, says the old man at his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already completely alive, despite the morning.
The normally silent television screens in the office produced news, and the usually loud crowd was completely silent to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his departure.
When the markets opened, the screens were all red.
It was a morning I never thought I'd live, says the Old Man.
Nor did Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, complete two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, despite the milling.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and so the situation was somewhat peaceful, says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote has begun a corrective movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The point collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market began to see sharp declines in the UK and particularly in the London real estate market.
London office space was forecast to decline by up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison is gone, but the air is still uncertain.
It's not like it's on the faces of the old man who spent his last summer days in Helsinki this week.
He believes that it is too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
There is so much still to be done: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The first reports on the development of the London real estate market have already been received.
The information on price developments from CBRE, a real estate services company, covers about a third of the market.
According to them, prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent between June and July.
In the City of London, the mine has accumulated 6.1% of the mine, the Old Man lists.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're changes in the monthly.
The monthly index was launched in 1987 and has only been worse in five months, says Vanhanen.
All the same declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting that Brexit was compared quite quickly to the fall of Lehman and the global financial crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks the illustration is not quite right, because this is the British domestic crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has now seen not panic sales like it did at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
I'm not sure if you can afford it.
The repair operation could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, he is not surprised by the price correction movement - one that could have been possible without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world's leading cities have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and, in particular, the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started off really high.
London's prices have risen for four reasons, the Old Man's list.
The UK economy has grown strongly, so has the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership to go global, says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment opportunities abroad.
London is known as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced, for example, pension companies to seek profits from new items.
On top of that, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhasen, the debt burden has been used much less now than it was during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
♪ Dispersed, dispersed ♪
In London, prices have been steadily rising since last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen started to lighten its holdings in London, and last year, there were net sales.
There was a twist to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the Old Man.
He's not afraid to judge the future, but he says there's hardly any bullshit.
The mood suggests a downward or steady direction ahead.
The old man has seen more ups and downs since he's been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that working out the mines is the only way to survive.
If you're prepared for the risks well, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If it's decreased, then the risks are decreased, says the Old Man.
S-group will start recording purchasing data more accurately than ever before
Soon, the S-Group will know what you're eating, because today, the retail group announced that it's starting to gather more information about its target customers' purchases.
Once the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will start to collect it for purchased products in early May.
The S-group follows Kesko in this regard, as the information on the goods purchased on the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information shall be collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have ever banned the use of product data, Riitala told the Economic Gazette.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the change in registration of the S-group.
Kesko already classifies its target customers into 10 groups based on their food purchases.
The rating is updated monthly.
The number of customers is also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent.
The data will be used for customer-targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchasing data shall only be collected from the own chains of the K group.
The Commission has also concluded that the Commission is not interested in the possibility of using the information provided by the Commission.
Lidl Finland does not have a port customer programme and does not have one planned for this year.
The Finnish local market has its own Single Bonus Programme, which can be accessed in the Electoral Houses, Siwo and Euromarket.
We're not currently collecting product or product group information, we're staying at the end-of-year level.
So we know where the shop was, and we know the day of the purchase, and we know the customer's receipt.
"We have not reached the level of the K-group or the S-group", says Anu Ora, commercial manager.
He said the customer support programme is to be renewed in the future, but the local shop will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not allow for the registration of product information.
Start with the experiment.
SOK's client and owner register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information also includes occupation, education, residence, years of birth and previous personal data.
The same persons and their roles are also registered.
The S-Signal Card Shop records the date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of the purchase and the payment method.
In addition, the information on S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
Starting in early May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, for S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, the data is for the time being recorded at product group level.
The aim of the project is to improve the quality of the services provided by the public sector.
S-Group says they're informing their customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is in the vaults anyway, whether you want it or not.
The applicant may check the data stored on the S-group websites.
For example, the banks cannot access the data, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila Puppy is Customs' newest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first exploding puppy
The black Labrador's puppy sniffs five similar land-lined boxes at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it's firmly seated next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite game.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a bottle of scented scented gas.
"Food gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now", says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to the e-commerce
Heila is the first dog in the customs service to specialize in weapons and explosives and will be deployed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Heila and Suntie may also be transferred to other border crossing points and ports where necessary.
However, the airport will be the main workplace of Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks were the subject of a number of measures by Customs and controls have been tightened since the attacks, says Inspector General of Customs, Mikko Grönberg.
The second way to train the armed and detonation forces in customs is through the port of Helsinki.
With the increase in e-commerce, up to 40 million mailings are sent through the airport each year, possibly including foreign-ordered equipment and explosives.
In recent years, customs have made online purchases, passenger baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport, including about 300 items related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials.
Heila will be working in different parts of Helsinki Bay.
It's gonna be looking into all the checked baggage and mail.
In the future, it will be of great benefit to the port sector by allowing it to go through large container areas and to mark areas that require further investigation, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the Heila, Customs is assessing whether more weapons and detonation dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School at the Church
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull School for Dogs in the Church.
Suntio also trains with Heila at the police and defense forces' specialists.
The police have a strong background in dog training and the defense has expertise in explosives.
Customs and other authorities decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues in Helsinki Bay include the customs authorities' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador breeder Heila has been selected from 10 puppies.
The criteria for selecting a dog for the airport include the ability to scratch and hunt, and the tranquility of the dog as it deals with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Sun's house, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but he is also a family member.
Nothing goes home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Heila's got a lot of fine orders coming from the coal mines.
The nightly news cameraman loses the camera's mic protection to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-like protection immediately on the "snap" command.
A tough competition from a working dog
Heila's elementary school graduation is next year.
The next level of tests will be held in October to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in Helsinki Beach in the second half of next year if all goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, travelers cannot come to the beach to pet a dog in a workrobe, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of a working dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year.
They have a working life of about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they are retired and in the care of their owners.
Workdays may be long, ranging from eight to 10 hours, but active work hours last only from 10 minutes to a few hours.
There's a lot of competition in the city for working dogs.
Heila's employed about 20 to 30 customs officials.
I'm lucky Suntie didn't have a working dog before, but she has years of experience working with dogs and supervising customs.
The mini-state won its first Olympic medal . The nation gets a day off .
The country's under a million residents in the Olympic Rugby League are so highly regarded that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the case after the championship was decided.
The day of freedom is the day after the team returns home.
The hero team is also allowed to hold parties in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the final in the capital Suva, where a screen was installed on the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even in Chinese restaurants, they watched the game, I heard them cheer", Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
In Rio , a Finnish elevator turned after a violent performance .
Weightlifter Milko Tokola made his last attempt after a hard-fought 175kg fight.
The stool has a special and life-threatening trait to lift.
During or immediately after the heavy lifting, he has been paralyzed many times.
No one's ever been able to tell me why.
Tokola was found in Rio with a weight of 175 kg and a weight of 145 kg.
His total weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola was trying to get his weight back to 175 pounds, just like the other guy.
On the third attempt, the weight increased with a furious scream.
The body trembled under the weight until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish elevator's joy was accompanied by the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired Estonian striker Prosa - Vikkausliga - Evening News
The Rovaniemi Football Club, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa for the remainder of the season.
We're looking for a top player with a lot of talent and a small chance to make it to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We've been through a bunch of 50 players from around the world with over a dozen player agents.
Prosa has gradually emerged as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Floral, California, where he has scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He's also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is due to join RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjo, where the Rovaniemians will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
The RoPS needed a new attacker when Alexander Cook, the last season's painter, moved to Australia.
The modern family star is back in the spotlight: teenage shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became known as Alex Dunphy in the modern family comedy series, is once again being disgraced by a menacing body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini-horses that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts not only exposed the actor's feet, but also this back.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by making a significant change in style and behavior.
The star has posed for her social media posts in very few clothes and taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very small robes.
Winter, on the brink of adulthood, has also recently released several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see the picture, you can see it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life, and he grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more he looks on the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was just 11.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his altered image.
It's not hard to imagine where he will be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard", says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge them to ignore criticism.
You look great!
No matter what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration to many women, a bright young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland, attracting tourists with a flashlight: in autumn it is possible to see the random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to encourage Japanese people to start their return trips from the start, Visit Finland said in a statement.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese resorts.
The winds are the main cards of our winter travels, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and the snowy landscape.
The demand for return trips in Lapland in the winter is high, but we are now trying to increase sales of the autumn trips.
Few people know that the revontulism season begins in early autumn and continues into late spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake surface reflects the rays of light, making the view twice as random, says Anne Lind, vice-president of marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's revamped campaign is focused on wealthy, urban Japanese women aged 25-35 who dream of travel and new experiences.
They're already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Among other things, tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising.
A survey by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turin and Tokyo showed that Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more unique sights than Finland, and Lind believes that this reventole has enormous potential.
The number of overnight stays for Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than twice as many nights as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for tourism in Finland, having spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in the Rugby 7 World Cup when Fiji's champions won gold
Britain's impressive success in the seven-man rugby competition was broken by Fidzi's victory in the final at the Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday, number 437.
Fidzi taught masters in the field of handball, move, side-court, back-to-back, track and field and wrestling, thus winning gold  if the country had won its first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss was silver, which was a slightly more consoling relief for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day.
The South African boxers' strong victory in the 75 semi-final earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fidji team in this form would have defeated the British, even if the 15-man team had been in full force.
Britain may be comforted that at least one Briton will be awarded a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former England rugby sevens coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens tournament while Ryan was coaching.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Losing hurts, but progress is shocking.
Fidzi started out great and presented his skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his crew had collided with a group of moving buses, and the world champions rose to a 5-0 lead as Osea Kolinisau made a corner jump.
With the clock ticking, Jerry Tuwai scored a second goal on the right side of the goal kick.
We were 120, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant stunt prevented the shocking third painting by Leone Nakarawa, but it did not slow Fidz's departure for long.
After seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal in the right corner, after which Great Britain was down 17-0 on the grid.
Nakarawa scored the second goal of the game, with over a minute left in the first half.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvouvou jumped through the weaker obstacles of the British team and jumped over the goal line.
After the painting was fired, the opening period ended at 290.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British were still in the role of apprentices.
Which is pretty much true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes in the half and managed to hold the Fijians for a total of four minutes, a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored thanks to the Fijians' excellent team play.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 367 by scoring a left-handed goal for Great Britain, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the audience.
It was hard not to admire Fidji's pure joy.
The lowest winner made the final round of the Fiji Cup by scoring a goal at the last minute.
The bell rang, the Fijians hugged each other, and the British fell to the ground, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had defeated Japan in the semi-final by 205 and Britain had overtaken South Africa in a tight semi-final, where a draw was decided by a goal kick from Great Britain.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his stunning footwork and fell under the paint thresholds in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England's 15-man rugby union team player Anthony Watson, sealed the win and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to pursue gold.
There's no more emotional gold in these games.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning made history with 220 wins and found further purpose for their golden moment at the Estacio da Lago.
Although they were two in the air, the third boat to be heard was coach Robin Williams' voice, who encouraged them to win their second consecutive Olympic gold in women's doubles, making them the first British women in the history of sport to achieve the same feat.
Their superiority was undeniable, their 39th consecutive victory and yet another record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the water like a young goat, does not fully reflect the nature of success.
Behind every salt-glass is a large group of helping hands, each of whom has contributed twice as much to achievement, but the most important of these is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who didn't know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was very tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be removed.
If it hadn't been for the surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way we think a little bit".
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were lucky that Williams was able to start his own breed outside of the season in early 2014, when the suspension caused as little harm as possible, if at all, under circumstances like this.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It worked as a stimulant.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward six, nine and 15 meters at a time, when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
The gun itself is a long way off, but this one has made it a little bigger".
Immediately after the win, the thoughts of the two were on Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more normal trying to overcome his own unease.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who was on a tour of Afghanistan, says: "I've been in the rubble this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much".
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years of Helen and Robin's safe have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not have wished for a better person to train with or a better coach".
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The duo have found a superb rhythm that their rivals have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 yards, as the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very much caught up in the moment.
Helen's hockey is "Stay with me, stay with me".
It is very important not to get off track".
"We did well in the journey, and at the same time we did not try to do anything miraculous.
We were not aiming for heaven today, we just wanted to make a good bond and win the race we did".
Two people think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover is having a wedding next month with Steve Backshall, a character from the television series Nature.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on me".
"After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better", she says.
Iceland replaces the government that was robbed by the Panama floods
Iceland is holding an early parliamentary election in October, which is being called for by protesters who have been angry at the Panama floods since spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed the tax evasion of many Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it wasn't enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day is now October 29.
Analysts say it's difficult to predict how much the nation's latest anger will affect the outcome of the fall election.
In the June presidential election, criticism of those in power was evident, and a non-political candidate, Gudni Johannesson, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS.
The Republican presidential candidate of the United States, Donald Trump, has withdrawn his latest speeches of terror.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in the organization's creation.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speech and demanded an apology from Trump.
As commander-in-chief of the military, you should never let anyone down like that, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-favorite burkini swimsuit for swimming, reports the Guardian, for example.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that swimming and swimming are forbidden for anyone who does not wear a well-mannered and secular swimsuit.
The decision also states that swimming pools that exaggerate religious affiliations may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, a man linked to two extremist groups linked to the Islamic State attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the Oulu area 's swimming water has exceeded the seawater level in the blue-green lagoon of Lake Laukösö
Water samples taken from official swimming pools in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the beach of Lake Pigeon has been detected with a bluish-black spark.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Environment Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
The concentrations of E. coli and enteric bacteria from the intestinal compartments of all bathing waters except the coast of the Mediterranean Sea were below the measures provided for in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E. coli and enterocoke levels in the waters of the Marine Basin were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-black deposits observed on the shores of Lake Baikonur do not yet render the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-black deposition, which will result in blue-green deposits of water on the surface.
Environmental action is monitoring the situation with a tight inspection.
If the bluetongue becomes bluetongue, the swimming pool reporting table shall also be provided separately.
Check the results of the swimming water samples here.
The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 laying down the rules on the application of this Regulation.
The reduction in forest donations is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The income tax law proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the generational tax on the forestry sector.
The Ministry of Finance has proposed that forest yield reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest areas, to rejuvenate the ageing population of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's objective is to promote an entrepreneurial forestry sector.
The forest owner would deduct the net capital income of the forestry sector.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote generational forestry changes is good, says Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Association of Agricultural Producers (CFA).
However, the applicant finds the tax reform proposal to be a criticism.
The forest grant reduction shall be undertaken on the net capital income of the forest owner.
That is the capital income from which all other deductions are deducted.
MTK and Hakkaraisen consider that the tax reduction would be more effective if the reduction could be made directly from the profits of the sale of wood.
The presentation of the VM is based on the premise that the reduction in the net forest income prevents the loss of forest income which would be deducted in other taxation.
A person like that would get a tax break even if they didn't sell the wood.
The calculation model is a little complicated.
The average forest owner can't see it, says the Hacker.
He also said that the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
The threshold for the tax reduction on the value of forest production is EUR 40 000.
It's been drawn too high in the mind of the Hacker.
In this way, he said, it would remove 82% of Finnish forest owners from the reduction zone.
He says the model would have an impact on about 10 percent of forest ownership.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the space.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest yields has been taken away for decades, according to Hakkaraisen.
The reason for this is the ageing of the forestry sector.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of forest owners are retired.

Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent findings of researchers at the University of Turin can help to make cancer treatments more effective.
The findings of the research team of Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and the tissue cells grow normally in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to a normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published in the highly regarded journal Nature Communications on August 4.
The prosecution is still investigating the murder of Muhosh's family.
The court continues to hear the family murder of the two convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family in Muhoks.
One received eight years and four months, including a young manslaughter and a brutal robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of grossly endangering traffic safety as a young person and of driving a motor vehicle as a young person.
The appeals court's ruling was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harshest sentence.
The prosecutor is demanding a lighter sentence for a man convicted of murder as a young person and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were on time in full understanding.
The appeals court said the 17-year-old boys killed a man who worked as the head of the school's child protection unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder allegedly attacked a driver sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The director had escaped and had entered the young man's room, when another young man struck him with a blowtorch.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the psychological investigation, both of the convicts were at the time of the crime in full understanding.
The court found that the young men had been planning to flee the family home since at least the day before.
The ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, only reproducing at 156.
The world's longest living spine is a confirmed ice shark, says a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The fact that the ice is growing only one centimeter a year adds to the life of the ice.
Only one species of shrimp is known to live longer than the ice shark.
The researchers were able to determine the age by radioactivity.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residue.
They were the basis for the scientists to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, but a throw in one direction or another could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump as the economic wisdom of the world - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state's tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's corporate tax reform was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with the most profitable tax breaks.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
If we didn't, we'd have a really big sum of money, $1 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent, after Trump's 33 percent cut.
We'd give up the inheritance tax altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulating business and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards set by the Hellenic authorities must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform is going to have to be reviewed.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump says "destructive" trade policies are the biggest cause of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
It would be a 45 percent tax on imports from China and a 35 percent tax on imports from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanity, not globalization, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
American cars will be driving on the streets, American planes will be connecting cities, American ships will be guarding the seas, American steel will be raising new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his usual ways, Trump faithfully reads the speech written by his aides, despite 14 interruptions by well-organized protests.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump's program as leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released her own program early Friday, Finnish time.
The Wave of Attacks on the Past - People's News
The sea is waving fatefully, but a real wave of attack is hitting the streets of Madrid... and the reckoning with the past can begin.
In short, that's the heart of Pedro Almodóvar's story of novelty.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, The Traveling Pants (2013), was a short-lived and semi-running satirical comedy, preceded by Iho in which I live (2011), the highlights of the Spanish actress' career.
Equally, Julieta (2016) is somewhere between the two works.
It is a conventional inner drama of love, human relationships, and family, centered on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and can be seen from far behind.
Life seems to be a pattern for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left wondering until the end of the movie.
In the form of a long letter, Juliet recounted the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
He starts from before the birth of his daughter, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
In the second female role, Julieta is portrayed by Adraina Ugarte, a young teacher from the TV series The Time Between the Ommelt (2013-2014).
Juliet's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a treat, but I would say quite a bit, literally, by repeating the process.
For the Almodóvar films, often with such a distinctive flair for humor, there's always a fair distance to Juliet.
It's a solidly staged, well-controlled, place-by-place movie with good music and a very sad film with elements of elegance.
Instead, the Spanish director has a visual richness of colour that starts to strike a little bit of a silent eye as a pure fashion piece rather than a dramatic exercise in effect.
The characters in the film are suffering from illness, death, or some other sudden loss, but the surface remains the same.
This is particularly true of the costume: in the case of the name person, the accommodation varies from scene to scene, and the same applies to the apparent replacements.
Almodóvar is very precise in these matters, but the main thing, the adjustments to each scene, are not particularly improved.
Mechanically, when it's repeated, the effect is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written a screenplay based on three novels by Alice Munro, a Canadian who won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.
The novels have been published in the book The Carnival: Stories.
Almodóvar has contributed to dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filmmaking.
The subject matter would have been emotionally unparalleled in the drama, as big as the subject matter of the film, especially the sheer guilt.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The main cast includes Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti.
The movie's opening night is Aug. 12.
The government is trying to win the election.
The ministers are not making any new cuts, they are hooking up so that the fundamentalists do not collapse completely.
But the surgery, which is scheduled for spring, is done at the grocery store.
There's no more surgery.
The four billion dollars already decided on are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Co) assure under the budgetary procedure.
It is true that there are no new operations in the VM's presentation, since the social security operations were decided on as early as the spring.
The reduction in the child benefit, the social pension, the basic unemployment insurance and almost all other social pension indexes will be 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployment insurance scheme will be reduced from 500 to 400 days.
The training operations are continuing.
The royal ghosts
Why are ministers so emphatic about not having new surgeries?
Because next year is an election year.
The royal election is in April and they're the most important heat meter of the election season, not the gallops.
It has been seen before that the result of municipal elections in different directions by the governing parties is ruining the government's mood for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that the ruling party expects fundamentalists to lose a crumb, despite its previous election result being unpopular at 12.3 percent compared to parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the fundamentalists received 752 new deputies, many of whom will be paid next spring for their influence in the right-wing government.
The life cycle of the government of three or so major parties depends on the survival of the fundamentalists.
It has not lasted long, but more than half of the voters have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's position have also emerged.
The rhetoric of no new cuts is to overshadow the fact that they will be done vigorously next year and to try to soften the blow to the fundamentalists.
Major surgeries in 2018?
In a year, things are probably going to be different if the Sibylla government is still standing.
The government has set a target of debt consolidation for this election period, but the budget proposal for Petteri Orpo will take into account EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the election period and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt seems neither to have been borrowed nor even to have slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means new, even tougher cuts on the old ones in the 2017 budget lines.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018 and then in the spring, what comes next will be voted on in parliamentary elections.
I don 't think these things have made you go into debt .
It is clear that the current measures have not been able to create a positive mood.
The Commission's proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States are also in line with the Commission's proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States.
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be universally based, meaning that there is no attraction from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recovered much since the collapse in 2008, except during the period of the recovery policy initiated in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% over the decade, increasing from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a market economy investor in the form of a market economy investor.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt collection of the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment is around EUR 6 billion, which is almost entirely covered by new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the assembly and the fundamentalists of what is responsible.
Question: You want to leave a lot of work to the honorees
Three out of four believe that the responsibility of the municipality is to provide day care, youth work and exercise, according to a study by the KAKS Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
The vast majority of the population also has responsibility for libraries, culture, public universities, building control, secondary education and waste management.
The responsibility of the country is to be more clearly defined by the provinces, specialised healthcare, vocational education, higher vocational education and training and the institutional care of the disabled.
No tasks in the responsibility of the municipality for the administration of public order are to be transferred to the State.
A juvenile drunk driver ran a chase to escape police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from the state of Jönsü ran away from a police party on the island of Ilomantsi on Friday night at 1:30 p.m.
The police tried to stop a motorcycle that was driving without lights, but the young man ran off to run away from the police at a fair speed.
The journey continued to the Sonkajan Beach, from which it continued to Sorronahonti and to a smaller forest road where the motorcycle ran off the road.
Soon afterward, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman caught up with the fugitive.
The ventilation test on the driver showed a 0.75 per milliliter.
He also did not have a driving license that would have entitled him to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious road safety threat.
A truck in a rock fell into a ditch .
A truck in a rock fell into a ditch on the Knees River on the Cavinti River Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had been driven to the left in a corner and out of the road and fell into a side lane.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver from the crashed truck through the door above the left, along with the rescue helicopter crew and paramedics.
The car owner was responsible for lifting the vehicle.
A truck that fell down the road was spilled with hydraulic oil that the rescue service sucked into the mud.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the Air River.

The materials of the major accident in the air. Watch the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest.
The storming of the Parafest festival tents caused extensive destruction.
Arto Pippuri, President of the Parafest Association in Joensuu, said the festival will be financially viable and could be held next year.
The last performance of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, was on the final stage of the competition on Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theatre beginning at 1 p.m.
The Art Center of Ahos has a Parafest show at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
The program is being organized as planned.
The fall flow is generated in a cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a falling airflow.
Changes in the water's shape in the cloud bind the heat, and as a result, the descending air cools and accelerates its velocity toward the ground.
The Meteorological Institute reports that there are several summer floods in Finland.
It's hard to predict the path of the seizure.
The storm surge struck the backyard of the Joseon Art Museum, the site of the Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5:00.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, he slightly injured four people.
One child was in the group and was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
Londoners are getting older because of air pollution
A study has shown that the skin of Londoners ages faster than normal.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The Evening Standard reports that the British study was conducted.
British skin care company Caci analyzed the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin in London without any.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of their peers in rural areas.
The tiny particles that age the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illnesses, killing nearly 9,500 Londoners each year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to pass through the most loading layer of the skin.
The CAC study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk to work near busy streets.
For example, people in London may try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing various masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor brakes were cheating .
The man had moved stones in his yard by tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor hit the man.
The man did not fall, but the tractor pushed him so far that he was taken to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor couldn't take the wave any longer because it hit the rocks in front of it.

Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Cup of salibandy since 2003.
The sixth race is now underway in Tampere, and only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American races.
I was working at the market and playing with the women there when I noticed the ad.
The United States was setting up a national salib band.
I got interested, and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near the town of Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I first came to Joensuu, there was no such thing as salibandy at the SM level.
They were playing basketball in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later played ice hockey in the SM series with the Jumppa.
Jumppanen played for the university in the salibandys SM series in the 1991-92 season, and spent the next three seasons in Josbas.
Along with playing, he trained the A's for the championship.
The women's SM series peaked at silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-liiga through 10 games, totaling 169 matches, 51 + 34 = 85.
The last SM period is 2001-2002.
The Pussycat and the Tattoo Curve were named to the national team .
Perttu Puska, who was raised by the Joseba family of the Salisbury family in the River Estuary, and Tatu Väänänen, who is from the Estuary, were selected for the Finnish national team to play in the Czech Brno EFT on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, 25, has played in the Helsinki Erak before the six-man country match, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender from Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, has recovered from a hip injury and is a regular member of the national team with 117 international appearances.
The national team also includes the Seinäjoen Pelivelli competitor Mika Kohonen, who was last seen wearing a Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salibandy team is the Count Count Count Petri Kettunen.
Beach volleyball star Essi Hasun 's circle closes in Kouvola .
Essi Hasu is retiring from beach volleyball at least temporarily after the season.
The Finnish beach volleyball championships will be decided at the Kouvola Sportspark this weekend.
Over the course of three days, medals will be played in both the adult and youth competitions.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Air Ballers and the Finnish Air Ballers' Association, the six best pairs from each series will be selected for the SM final tournament.
The local colour is represented by Essi Hasu, a member of Elimäen NMKY, who has been part of the Finnish beach volleyball team for several years.
Now based in Helsinki, Hasu is eagerly awaiting games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see it this weekend.
I'm sure the Pesis Stadium is going to be a great arena.
I haven't played in the big leagues in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu's mood.
The Kouvola neighborhood lit up Hasu's sparkle for sport and gave good dinners for a great pastime.
I've got a lot of memories of my childhood.
I started flying at age 9 with the E-girls of the Elements NMKY.
The main thing is a big game shirt, knee pads with a curved ankle, and a lot of high-pitched aces and choreography after the score, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team's shared spirit created an environment that was comfortable to play in.
All the families were very active. Our team-mate's father trained us, and our mother was president of the club for a long time.
As a junior, Hassou's beach volleyball was a natural legally binding weight for the ball.
The pool on the curb has been playing drums since the 1990s.
The operation has always been active.
I also went to the Junior Junior Junior Tournament myself, thinking that one day I would be there playing.
Now that dream comes true, Hasu plays the weekend with the youngest kid, Anniina Parki, in the SM finals.
The aim of the second-ranked pair in the tournament, after Rich Lehtosen and Taru Lahda, is clear.
We have a medal as a realistic goal.
We still lack the SM gold in the prize box, the Hasu throws it mysteriously.
The weekend performance in Kouvola may be the last audience Hasou knows.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are expected in the civil war.
Yeah, well, my international career is over after the Kissing Ball.
Otherwise, the toenails will be nailed, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
A storm surge knocked down tents at the disabled event in Joensu, a major accident was nearby.
The storm has knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Johannesburg.
According to the newspaper Karjalaisen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to a hospital for further treatment.
According to the cattle, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show in one of the larger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened Friday at 5:00.
Markus Viitaniemi, a firefighter who interviewed Karjalain, told the newspaper that the situation was a catastrophe.
The paper says the outcome of the incident is in doubt.

Solomon's Ark Bravely Left as a Farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial activity means taking risks, working hard and being diligent.
A young farmer, 25-year-old Solomon Koli, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
Koli started about two years ago with his younger brother, Valtteri Koli, as a continuation of their home business.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and counsels the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant borrowing and increasing the supply so that bread could be made available to farmers.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always loved to hang out on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yard pond, and at first the bank wasn't too excited about it.
However, I myself took a very courageous part in the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken the initiative if he had not believed in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out for the better.
The goal of Salomon Kol, a carnivore, is to invest in even larger carnivores.
The work has paid off, as Solomon's Colli has been selected among the top ten in the Contest for Young Food Producers for the Future of Rural Life magazine.
He's currently competing for a potential win.
He can vote on the paper's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months

The average annual inflation rate measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was 0,8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (% in July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been 0,2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0,2%.

The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
SnapChat's anime franchise is being criticized for being an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says it was the inspiration for the anime, but some observers say it's racist.
With the help of SnapChat's lens tool, some 150 million daily users can alter reality and play with identities in ways that are approaching absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an anise, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are unadorned, feature-deforming tools that create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All the delusional steps are quickly becoming public knowledge.
SnapChat's lenses have received criticism, accusing it of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin as a beauty target.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into dirt, twisted their teeth and turned cheeks into pimples, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people.
Critics also wondered if these repeated contradictions pointed to a larger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage spread widely on Wednesday, and online publications such as The Verge and Motherboard wrote about it the day after Snapchat announced it had removed the filter.
The company explained that the lens was intended to honor anime characters, not Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Part of me was bitterly opposed to the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet about the images was widely circulated, said in her email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds: "It is hard to deny that the very tasteless Asian cocktail is comparable to the efficiency of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellowface, but one that has been taken to a degrading extreme".
Snapchat isn't the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry.
The large audience on Snapchat is made up of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their parents, which could mean that they are likely to expect even more sophistication.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, things like this don't go unnoticed as easily as they used to", said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer for Medium Publishing, decided to delete his Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article published in Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnic conflict reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white and male-only leadership and ended his post with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that their one-man staff does not have people of color to make decisions like this, or they have employees who are also people of color, but their position is not one that would allow them to express their opinion directly and easily", says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the allegation.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff on the basis of its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss its staff's ethnic background, but according to its spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups and promoting engagement within the company.
Zhu himself says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say this is not OK".
According to a congressional expert panel, military officials misrepresented intelligence about ISIS.
A congressional panel of experts released a report Thursday that officials at the U.S. Central Command's military command changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground suggested.
The chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee on Intelligence and Defense Spending, a Republican subcommittee, formed a task force that reported on "general discontent" among intelligence analysts in the House Armed Services Committee, which analysts say enhanced its assessment of U.S. actions against the Islamic State.
Central Command, Centcom for short, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by senior Centcom executives generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism than the facts on the ground showed, and were, without exception, more positive than analysis by other intelligence agencies", says a press release on the report.
"The events of Centcom cannot be tolerated  our soldiers suffer when high-level policymakers are presented with false analyses", says California Republican Rep. Ken Calvert.
"The Centcom executive portal's mistakes extend to the top of the organization".
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015, including the descriptions and analyses of US operations to train Iraqi forces by Central Command.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama's administration were forged, it provides an analytical picture that suggests Centcom executives would have pressured them to give a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were far more positive than what actually happened", says the report.
"For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military strike to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015".
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear", said Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence officials in the U.S. armed forces manipulated intelligence to reduce the threat of ISIS in Iraq".
The Republicans formed the task force after learning of the analysts' suspicions that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will follow more detailed results as investigations continue.
In addition, the DOD's inspector general has launched an investigation into the intelligence of Centcom.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were in part consistent with the Republican group's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence on ISIS and the Iraqi security forces", said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic member of the committee.
According to Schiffin, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "broken analytical morality" and "insufficiently ignored divergent views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to a "predetermined or official political line".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional survey.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, which was launched following claims by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans says in his press release that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security topics".
The investigation has other implications besides the fact that it seeks to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by several defence authorities).
But last year's claims could have raised questions about President Obama's confidence in Central Command and its honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIL intelligence reflects the disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that despite the objections of many analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush supported only a small number of troops in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency against ISIS intelligence.
According to officials, last year, the Hooker Task Force concluded that despite conflicting public statements, the air strikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the investigation were not communicated outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers had judged testimony to the Senate to be too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April, and General Joseph L. Votel took over as commander of Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth women's national field hockey double and consolidates its position in the mid-term debate with Britain .
After scoring three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, when the United States defeated India.
Five points in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had ever done the same.
"I have no idea", he says.
"I'm not one of those people who likes to read about what they paint".
But he knows this: The Americans have won four games and lost zero in their Olympic tournament and share first place with the British team, who continued their winning streak by defeating Japan 2 0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which will decide which of them will place first and which second in the six-team division.
The first to avoid a long-term confrontation with the highly regarded Dutch team that won the second block.
Despite Saturday's game, the Americans have already boasted of their surprise success at these games, four years after it finished last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and made his first National Hockey League debut at age 3 (his older twin sisters played hockey in Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final roster.
This was followed by the 2012 race, where he and his team were hardly successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as head coach, and things began to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual, and physical", says Bam.
"Our employment in London was not what it is today.
We have made a complete change".
Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half, hitting the ball close to the goal line.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept the 10 position until the third period, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, kicked a goal in the middle, hit the ball, and led the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored her final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The game was the first in the tournament where U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal blank, with one hit in each of the first three games for the Americans.
Briggs is now in his prime.
Same as Bam.
"Our investment is good now", says Parnham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of the game on Saturday.
In the middle of the Olympic pool, a trampoline brings a woman.
No matter where or when you are, you're bound to hit the Olympics.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next lively message, constantly and everywhere.
It's like the Olympic Butterfly itself is a flaming hostel, moving from archer to swimmer, swimmer to strength and strength triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in a coffee line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympian, is charming with his smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would be seen and included in the best time to watch and listen, would be a favorite of sponsors and would appear in good-natured TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic torch does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Farther from the center, in the shadows are some less well-known sports, such as air gun shooting, archery, volleyball, and taekwondo.
We'll always have a breastfeed, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a humble story about my own special, I want to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility has been so low for the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic event.
The ignorance can be regional.
The United States has had athletes compete in the Olympics, but the country has never won a medal or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and the women's medal table is second to the Canadians.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending the gold medals they won in London.
But there's a bit of a sub-baseman's charm in Trampoline, which is partly because to an uncivilized ear, it sounds more like a circus school than an Olympic one.
(I acknowledge in this connection that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has the comic potential that cartoon characters have used in endlessly continuous pomp scenes, but it also has the same value as gymnastics and swimming pool, which are the species that combine in a trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning "trampoline".
Ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline that will sink them to a height of nearly 10 meters, and before they land on their feet, the jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic movements, such as turns, tails, and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged on performance, difficulty and "flying time".
The Rio Trampoline Championships are contested by 32 athletes from 17 different countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic trend is straight forward.
When gold is sought, the metal hopes must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes backwards and forwards around the field.
In addition to the painting or the starting wall, they also have another goal for which they strive in television-based reporting, namely world or Olympic recording.
This determined pursuit is exalted, admirable, even fanatical, and even enough to bring tears to the viewer.
But I also find this a little tiring just watching the games.
This tram will give you a breathing break.
In the trampoline, the direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
A powerman jumps up like an astronaut, falls down, and he's not bothering to get back up.
Of course, the sport also has a competitive aspect, and it is not easy, but it is not about jumping or jumping too far, only about a dreamlike and a fusion of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen as only the Olympics can get.
The women's qualifying and final matches will be held on Friday afternoon and will start at 1 p.m. local time, with the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which begins at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of the Olympiad, they bring a moment of peace and beauty that may not be noticed in the midst of the general rush.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering attractive male athletes and objectifying them  as the US men's gymnastics officials recently suggested  according to the Wall Street Journal, then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fanbase to be alarmed.
A whole generation of protesters in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States.
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed political change-driven protests across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
However, in recent months, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests that are spreading to a wider area.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Demonstrations, allegedly filmed in late last year or early this year, show security forces beating young people with their hands on a wall.
The UN's top human rights official now calls for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult", says Rashid Abdi, director of the International Crisis Group for the Africa's Horn project.
By population, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries have promoted stability.
The US military and intelligence services are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive this much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, and the capital Addis Ababa has even been given a new freight train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from a democracy model, with human rights organizations continually reporting on the government's repressive policies, opposition in the country being very limited and dissenters being quickly suppressed.
Many people have been expelled from their land, imprisoned, killed, or driven into the desert.
But things may be changing.
"If a nation is suppressed and has no choice but to show its will, it will be blown out", says Seyoum Teshome, a professor at a university in central Ethiopia.
"All youths show their minds.
A whole generation protested".
There are many issues of discontent, from land use to the government's repression of power.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies have won the last seat previously held by the opposition, which means they now control the whole parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, where the escalating situation in June killed hundreds of people.
Analysts fear that the separatist groups that have been more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromia Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the chaos and rearm.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been raging for years under the surface is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It was only in the last few years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and Internet access improved.
Even though the government has repeatedly blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many people still access the Internet through intermediary servers that hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to demonstrate.
The second reason is the growing solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest populations, the Oromo and the Amharic.
Oromos and Amhara are not natural allies.
The Amharics, who are mainly from the Christian upper land of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country's politics and business and have stripped away the Oromo people, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is changing too.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella", says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest protests have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharians and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by a tribe of tigers, who make up only about six percent of the population, yet control the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analyses show that he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between the opposing sides.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct", says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes for almost unknown reasons.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariah comes from the south.
His analysis shows that he has no confidence in the security forces that run the Tiger Tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced similar unrest was in 2005, when thousands protested the elections, which, according to analysts, were first cancelled and then stolen by the government.
In the unrest after the election, many protesters were killed, although the death toll was lower than in the previous months, and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their long-term infrastructure planning, such as the new high-speed railway, and for their significant progress in fighting poverty.
But the anger within the Ethiopian government has clearly not stopped it from gaining strength.
And anger is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the city of Amhara, Gondar, protesters attacked tiger-owned businesses, and hate speech against tigers is spreading on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft to monitor Somalia, a neighboring country, but the US has recently closed the base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires a strict balance", says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried to recant his words on Friday in a debate he faced in his latest campaign, claiming he was not serious in repeatedly claiming this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to clearly communicate to his country's citizens.
His supporters also find themselves in a dire situation, trying to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at the election on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he said that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
But early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said he was sarcastic.
Trump tweeted his speech the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest criticism storm surged when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy by lowering his earnings.
Trump and Clinton were holding their economic policy line-up talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
He tweeted that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
In late July, he received widespread criticism for appearing to urge Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails, and later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic".
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and withdraws his words when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that arouse controversy among his supporters, watching how supporters react to them, and then 'clearing up' one way or another depending on the reaction", says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows they are round enough to pass through different seals".
Instead of softening his statements to the election public, Trump has changed his style even more dramatically in recent days as his support for the bill has continued to decline.
A new poll conducted by NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist, published Friday, found that Trump's support for Clinton is significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is tightly level.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speech, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But with increasing scrutiny in the last few months of Trump's presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal supporters in a position of being forced to publicly defend Trump's comments, however provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, argued vigorously for the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think his statements are justified, political", Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little, almost unknown organization, which Obama mistakenly called the 'series of the universe team' and that's why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq".
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to continue its activities when it failed to resolutely handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before the polls in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued his attacks on the media on Twitter, accusing them of his speeches being rigged and discriminatory toward him.
He mocked "ugly and pathetic" television commentators who tried to find out about him but, according to him, could not succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, saying it only made it clear that he was not a candidate for president.
The cafe in Greenpoint has been closed due to the unfair rental increase
Verb Cafe was a little-crazy coffee shop in Williamsburg, where cash was the only payment method, and there was no Wi-Fi, but it did offer good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its Bedford Avenue sidewalk when the rent went up unreasonably.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals consider this lower than the middle class to be a miserable loss of coffee.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club is gone, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop".
But even though New York isn't what it used to be, there's a new one coming out of it.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the staff are the same, and the atmosphere is still unfinished.
The coffee is still good too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When one customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same vendor as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
It also re-used even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new, though, and
Added new products to the list.
There are goat-chicken-egg-cheese sandwiches and filling capricious and browned onion rings.
There's also a list of black-and-white balls.
Coffee is no longer beer, but juice made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of serving coffee, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regulars were starting to come to Verb in a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg", he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently went to a coffee shop on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took a walk to the Verbs, then in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I started to like Verb's coffee and culture", she says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice cream, which is also listed as a good idea.
Another long-time client, Tom Rosenthal, has been a loyal guest at Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work and order the same thing without exception.
"I walked into the coffee shop every day at over seven o'clock, like a machine, and they were already making my cabbage with all the fillings", she says.
Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders her regular produce, but she occasionally swaps her bagels for bread, chicken eggs, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not mad that the soap store took the old place.
Soap Cheri's owners even offered to make a special coffee pot that uses Verb's own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still be able to hold on to the offer", Rodriguez says.
The Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also been happy to welcome the coffee.
One of the new customers turned the menu into a pool, and Rodriguez says that he is now looking for a suitable place for his new neighbors to feel welcome.
The new place has brought other advantages.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell coffee with cold brewed coffee.
The cafe could also be expanded into a building next door.
But for many customers, it's enough to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular at Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe closed.
Whitt says, "When the new place opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had come home.
"I missed the smell of coffee".
The grim food of the great pasture in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after his inauguration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his White House office.
Known as a culinary man, President Roosevelt had enjoyed the luxury of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the frog's-feed pasta and the Maryland turtle-feed.
His menu that day was more modest: Devil's eggs in a tomato sauce, potato juice and a dessert of bone marrow.
"It was a show of culinary solidarity with people who are suffering", says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of a high-rise apartment building in the Lower East Side neighborhood through food.
Their new collaboration is A Square Meal, published by Harper's and published Tuesday, which depicts the history of American food as a great sheep's day in the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by agreeing to meet with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, regular lunch bar near the Flatiron Clouds, which opened in the same year as the Great Depression, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive juice sandwich and Coe, 57, turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat pie, the couple said it was appropriate for a discussion about eating a very large portion of the lamb.
"The grief was very popular", says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut butter, liver butter and peppermint.
They were made of materials that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that you can eat them for a whole meal".
Andrew Coe is mocking.
"It must have been as heavy in the belly as lead", he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
The women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked cakes were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the people survived when they were suddenly forced to give up abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and troubling topic for Americans", says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally troubling was the new affordable diet: According to Ziegelman, the mysterious food items such as snacks and pastries became staples, and pastries were said to be "a great way to tap into food sources" because chefs could cover less attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been a staple of American food for years, became a sparingly used luxury.
We tried strange mixtures where the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional requirements and not taste or even healthy cooking.
In her research for a book that also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oatmeal spoons filled with peanut butter for the food of the off season.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table", says Coe, who
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oatmeal don't fit together at all.
This was typical of many household recipes".
Household economists, such as Louise Stanley, who served as head of the Federal Housing Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to be strict budget managers and respond to the challenge of making delicious dishes from dust like carrot-skin bagets.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic meals.
Particularly tasty are reports of government responses to its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like the millionaire and elegant gentleman who had become him.
"He liked European cuisine, like fish and a throat cactus", says Coe.
"He ate in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality".
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example with his belly.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, the food served at the White House was not only the tediest in Washington, but also the worst cooked".
Many of the disability foods were discarded as soon as the land was back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition continues to be reflected in the way we pay attention to calories and nutrition and the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple says that as they wrote the book, they began to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away", says Coe.
"People even started to feel bad about his food", recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one time with wind chimes".
When the main dishes were emptied in the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out a homemade feathery snack, the same one that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called a bone meal", says Ziegelman, adding that giving a name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, just feathers, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly soaked our spoon in a thick brown bean.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe did the second time, and the third time.
"Nuts would make this better", Coe tells his wife, sounding like a positive budget executive.
Gilead is being paid full attorney's fees for the C-hepatitis drug patent dispute with Merck.
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. was entitled to full compensation for the attorney fees it received in the litigation over a patent for the hepatitis C drug with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was released in June of $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck's patents for Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni success drugs, and a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of misappropriation of a whale and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to relief from the attorney fees it received for defending the case.
Merck is trying to get Gilead to dominate the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat as many as 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other demanding the private ownership of the laboratory-based sophosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
U.S.-backed forces have taken Manbij from ISIS.
U.S.-backed forces have taken control of the northern Syrian city of Manjibi, near the Turkish border, as the last ISIS fighters leave the city, a military spokesman said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) now scramble through the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages taken by ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are still conducting search operations", Darwish said.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, revealing that her and her husband's income at the time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech awards, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reported earning $3 million from a Simon & Schuster spending book about her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton, have released their 10-year tax returns.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should be able to determine whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be models of economic transparency", said Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind the excuses and quits his promises to release his tax returns.
The way it is, the US presidential candidates have always made their tax returns public, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to the IRS to review the tax administration and say that's why Trump hasn't released his income statements.
"The move is yours", Clinton's campaign aide, Ian Sam, tweeted, referring to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he won't let Trump release his tax returns until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, have said his refusal to release the information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his contributions to charity, his business relationships and many other ties, including ties to Russia.
Clinton has been holding onto this issue and posted online on Friday a video highlighting Republicans in prominent positions who are pushing Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in her speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, not to make public tax returns", Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no or little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax attorneys and auditors as saying Friday that the situation could continue to be similar.
Federal tax rates have risen to a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a bill, said billionaire investor Warren Buffett, that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent of the taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is headquartered in the same location, challenged Trump to meet with him, where they would both reveal their tax records.
Buffet says he too has been subject to a tax audit and that Trump is not afraid of tax authorities, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns all the way back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now reside in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32% of the actual federal tax in 2007-2014 and their actual combined tax rate was approximately 40,5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax returns show that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was earned by payroll.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and interest income totaling $109,000.

Lightning condoms filled with chili powder in support of elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep elephants away from a human shelter.  Elephants are in a hurry by throwing chili powder-filled condoms at them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign with the U.S. Nature Conservancy to teach villagers in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and farms without harming elephants.
A long time ago, spears were used to kill elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"With the development of the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now villagers can trust that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming them", says Honeyguide Foundation executive director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first to alert an intruding elephant is to point a flashlight and sound a trumpet.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw in the so-called chilip cloud.
The powder mixed with mud is placed in the condom together with the beam, after which the condom head is closed so that only the ignition line is left out.
When the ignition cord is turned on, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually, one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
A final weapon is a projectile that fires a flame known as a Roman candle into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli route number from Arab "body"  RT News
A French-born Jewish filmmaker sparked media fears after it was revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not mention the Israeli route number in its country-code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, expressed his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find a hotel on a routing list in Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel will be completely destroyed as if it never existed?"
It's Lanzmann who writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the move further shocked the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our visitors are Arabs, and they are demanding that the Israeli route number be removed".
Interviewed by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a great shame".
"This event is a shock and a shock to all of us.
It's such a shame.
And it's even more embarrassing considering that we're in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
That's all you need to explain.
We are waiting for the hotel to make the right decisions", says the ambassador.
The case caused quite a backlash online, which was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the claims of the alleged Arab customers.
"Despite" was the expression used in a publication highlighting the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the allegations, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"No direct order to exclude Israel from the itinerary was ever issued", writes a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber products in a protest by Brazilian students
Students met with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber products against protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement officials tried to disrupt the student gang, resulting in police using rubber products and tear gas.
Hundreds of students attended the demonstration, who wanted to show their frustration with the government's plans.
The governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a savings measure to close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new ones.
Some of the protesters were graffitiing the walls, protesting against Michel Temer, who was temporarily running for president.
The student demonstration came just days after the streets were filled with protesters supporting President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate voted to impeach him.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 %  RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent, reports Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in doing business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
'Russian companies are continuing their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further trade growth is of course one of the primary objectives of inter-country cooperation", Dzhagaryan says.
The Commission notes that the volume of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was fueled by the sale of aircraft, vehicles and weapons", says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was among the first 20 countries to have tourists visiting Russia for the first time.
And it's not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year", he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz, and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he says.
Scot Callum Skinner scored the British to win the gold in cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner claimed fame in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrom last night as the British trio defended their 2012 championship in London.
Skinner, 23, of Glasgow, was the anchor, inherited from his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoyle, who made a legend of himself by scoring and taking the win over what is considered the preeminent New Zealand team.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of their six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the feat after finishing sixth at the World Cycling Championships in London in March, despite Hoy's retirement from racing.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first drawer.
Hindes just showed up at the right time.
Hoey's decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Scottishman Skinner was a man who the British coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoye four years ago, set the Olympic record in the time trial, but New Zealand was faster in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in doubles.
Hindes was a complete loser after his rounds, but Kenny struggled to take the lead, which Skinner retained.
A major change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down with a larger range, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep pace.
Hoy followed in his role as BBC commentator and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped into the award show.
"I'm flattered by the comparison", says 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow.
I'm just trying to do my best and be successful.
We made the Olympic record in the finals and won the world championship.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to beat it".
After his victory in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to having fallen onto the track on purpose because of a bad start.
Later, he withdrew his word and the British competitors had no complaint.
This time, the victory of the sovereign was not related to problems like this.
Hindes says: "The atmosphere was like London, all the British flags flashing in the mirror.
Our team has been unified over the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships, winning the Olympics feels great".
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten championships in Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of progress made in the last five months, we have five successful days ahead of us on the velodrom.
As Kenny has shown with his talents, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoye's achievements and winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years Hoyta's younger and was also born on March 23 (a magical date for British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), would be evaded with six gold medals and one silver medal.
The medal award would be the same as Howie's.
Kenny's next race is the sprint, which starts today and ends in three days.
"Right now", says 28-year-old Kenny from Boltonia, "I can only enjoy this.
Team competition is always the best.
You'll enjoy the win with the guys.
Winning alone is a little lonely".
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get the knight's worth".
This was the only medal match of the day, but Britain had more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-man team time trial drivers.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record for the gold medal set in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 10:42) are being contested today on the second day of competition, and the focus of attention is certainly on Wiggins.
He had a fight with the competition officials yesterday before the deadline when the editors asked him to measure his height.
In the same women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milnavi, set a world record time of 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its great cycling team to take over the mid-Olympic and bring home a host of medals.
After the very exceptional evidence from full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas, not the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of great athletes like Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton's rivals.
However, the first night of the velodrom competition shows that Britain's already legendary reputation for reaching the top at the perfect moment is once again being fulfilled.
The future of Portland smelter in the wake of the end of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland, Victoria, aluminium smelter and the employment of thousands of workers is at stake when the power company supplying the smelter said that one of the plant's owners was terminating the supply contract and that all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the Victorian Government's decision earlier this year to stop operating the plant.
The firm, 20 years of support, will be terminated in November.
Alcoa's Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
The Commission has also taken the view that the measures taken by the Member States are not in line with the objectives of the common agricultural policy.
The snowball effect could continue to increase, as the distillery consumes about 10 percent of all electricity in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Angles power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland distillery is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially caused by the strong Australian dollar and more recently by the plant's production price.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter at its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other smelter owners to terminate their contracts as well.
The majority of the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, which has minority interests in the plant between CITIC in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
The AGL states that the agreements are known as protection agreements which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contract is terminated in 2017 with a duration of 12 months.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission is not in a position to take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the form of a market economy investor.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million "in anticipation of termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts 'will not affect Alcoa's ... capacity to keep the distillery operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the distillery'.
The American company said it had signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 that was set to go into effect in November of this year, although it has yet to determine why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
The weak economic situation in the sector has led analysts to be cautious in their estimates of both the Portland, Victoria, smelter and the Tomagon plant near Newcastle.
AGL's chief operating officer, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
'If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant decrease in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as producers, that would not be good news", says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian TV star Kendall as the pornographic daughter of September Vogue
Kardashian-Jenner model and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses for the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising partner and has appeared at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at me in a room full of my loved ones made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?), scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar breakers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest) pretending to have forgotten their sister's cover.
The plot is a cliché, and it is used in almost all the birthday parties of the donkeys' shows (Seacrest utters the words "Did you think we forgot you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get her other daughters to join in some way.
Her appearance in the September issue of Vogue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
September issue is the best-selling Vogue publication of the year.
A number that is more of a picture book than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion website Fashionis estimated that last year's 832-page study had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September issue is so eagerly anticipated that in the past two years, the magazine's images have leaked to the public before they were officially announced.
Previously, the September national models included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more about celebrities working as models than models who are celebrities.
Oscar-winning Dior advertising executive Jennifer Lawrence was in the picture in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model of her generation, and although she would rather be among the celebrities who work as a model, she is quite well-connected.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, real-life TV stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called gifted women who excel in entertainment.
Beyoncé, who was featured in the cover photo last year, has one of the strongest years of her career behind her, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of her TV background, Jenner's position in the world of fashion will always be a nuisance.
In June, Victoria's Secret original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "crazy".
These feelings have resurfaced once more when news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, the constant complaint of dissatisfaction seems unessential.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's been to Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
He's the advertising headline for the Estee Lauder makeup winning.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, maybe just as a way to meet her sister and her kids.
Legal aid centers turn away 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are being turned away from legal aid centres and the sector is preparing for the impact that additional cuts of funds will have on already marginal centres.
In Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal aid and legal services are already turned away. Most of them are elderly, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and unjustified displacement and similar injustices.
The public legal services, which are already overworked, are preparing for further cuts in the appropriations.
From June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing an additional 30% of federal funding.
According to James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, the latest report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres shows that thousands of people are already being turned away from the centre each year.
If the federal government doesn't back down, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are continually underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they seek essential services", says Farrell.
"People who leave violent relationships, people who are under uncontrolled and crippling debt burdens, families who are separating, unreasonably dismissed workers  all have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately release these financial cuts so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
It is time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients and the Palazcu government must invest in this important work.'
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump's campaign after no action was allegedly taken after its executive was told that the campaign manager in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun while driving a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a federal court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software consultant for the state campaign.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be handled internally before he, in his own words, realized that this would not happen.
Bordini said in his complaint that campaign manager Earl Phillip "put out a gun, put his right fore finger on the trigger and pressed a pipe into Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, after the complaint was filed with the local and regional campaign manager, Bordini was told that at least four other people had experienced the same thing as Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage", Bordini says in his complaint.
The vote comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused widespread outrage when he told a crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of the second amendment"  who are considered gun owners and gun owners  could take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose judges.
Trump's campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not encourage violence in his words.
Bordini's lawsuit calls for compensation from the campaign for negligent conduct and from Phillip for overtime, abuse and the emotional suffering they cause.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message asking her to comment.
Phillip was never reached despite attempts.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, said Phillip had just left the campaign.
The call for Phillip's consultancy, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been on a controversial campaign trail.
The Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to hear the case of Mr. Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow.
Heathrow is also a booster of the economy and a source of prosperity  not just for local communities and London, but for the whole country.
To me, this was the thing that was most interesting at Heathrow, and like the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all of our regions.
The Olympics were a huge asset to Stratford and the East End.
We're doing this by re-creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We are creating 10,000 new places of study and 40,000 new jobs for local communities alone, eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the London 2012 Olympics, there are always people who think Heathrow's expansion is too big a challenge.
As for the Olympians, I was told that Britain would never be ready for them and that we would be in a situation of embarrassment in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question you ask.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and boost the economy by £211 billion, bringing skills and employment to the airport environment and the whole of the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, including Terminal T5 which has been voted the best airport terminal of the year for two consecutive years and Terminal T2 which was built in the middle of the world's two busiest roads.
Now they are ready to produce a third corridor, backed by a private investment of £16bn.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for our country, and I am convinced that there will be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time we put the same Olympic spirit into Heathrow's expansion so that we can secure the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of Heathrow's board and former Secretary of Commerce at the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad-free cat and mouse game
The efforts of online advertising companies to mislead anti-advertising software have become a cat-and-mouse game, says one anti-advertising company.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking anti-advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it said users could update their anti-advertising software filters and thus again block community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the labeling codes for its desktop site to make it harder for ad-suppression software to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says they've discovered new codes.
Adblock's Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that "this kind of bullfight between the open source ad-suppression community and the deceivers has been going on since the ad-suppression was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be making its own corrective action again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how much of a concern the advertising industry has become.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use anti-advertising software, according to a study by PageFair and Adobe last year, an increase of nearly four times since 2013.
Facebook has 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in the misuse of anti-advertising software in its desktop application, as the notifier said that the anti-advertising software does not work on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop advertising is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update its user settings advertising tool to give users more control over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters for also blocking the viewing of some of its regular Facebook posts.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem", said a Facebook spokesperson in an email message.
"Advertising-proofing programs are flawed and ineffective, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves".
A woman committed suicide by jumping under cars on a Swiss motorway
Victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for eyewitness assistance on the highway in the early hours of Thursday following an accident in which a woman was deliberately left under multiple vehicles.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman made her desperate act by lying on a dark road, and she was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her suicide attempt was clearly suicide, and among the vehicles of the overpassers was a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
Police said many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and police are asking them or other eyewitnesses to report.
According to lawyer Gilles Hofstetter in the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneve, a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
It remains to be seen whether charges will be filed against the drivers involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid the collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to determine", says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases where drivers are not held accountable.
According to the newspaper, in both cases the person was walking on a dark highway, and the court ruled that drivers cannot expect to bump into pedestrians on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police department was acquitted of the charge of murder after he collided with a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had drunk a lot of alcohol and had stopped the road.
The court found that the police officer responding to the emergency call had a justified driving pattern and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unforeseen situation".
Any person with any knowledge of the accident that occurred near Morges on Thursday is requested to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus has been habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been habitable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that allows the study of Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions on Venus could ever be similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on its surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide.
According to previous scientific presentations, Venus' slow rotation is explained by its thick gas sphere.
However, from the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth's, and yet it has been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet likely had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic diversity to sustain life and prevent rapid decay.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its daytime orbit is almost two months at a time", says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain, creating a thick layer of clouds that acts like a rain shade and protects the surface from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperatures of the atmosphere are even a few degrees lower than the Earth's current temperatures.
The model created a story about Venus that matches previous assumptions by planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to extreme heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
In the carats of water left in space, only a thick carbon dioxide-rich gas field and a deadly greenhouse effect, known as Venus, remain as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of a new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is resigning his position as Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from his duties as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of ice hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in team decision-making.
Colorado's vice president/general Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the team will immediately begin hiring a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been serving as the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche and as the associate head ice hockey coach with diligence, passion and determination", said Roy, 50.
"I have spent the summer thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach and the vice-chair of the team's ice hockey activities must be in complete alignment with the organisation.
He must also have the say in decisions that affect team performance.
These conditions are not currently met.'
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today", says Sakic.
"We are grateful for all that he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future".
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for the league's coach of the year for his first season as Avalanche head coach in 2013-2014
He led the team to 112 points and a win in the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and hasn't made the postseason in the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record in 2015-2016 and were five points clear of the Minnesota Wild in the second Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career  two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
The North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend the strike
The main negotiators say the North Sea oil workers' strike will be suspended as all parties to the dispute enter a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services provider Wood Group have been held on drilling rigs in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The parties' joint statement states that 'Wood Group and Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute'.
From the beginning of next week, we will hold a series of day-long meetings over the next few weeks to discuss problems from fresh perspectives.
Trade unions justified their recent actions, which they said were the first in more than 25 years, in protest at possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
The Commission has therefore considered that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
The company's tariff reduction follows the decrease in prices of contractors operating in the countries by 10% in 2011.
The company claims that the additional operations give it the necessary mobility space to deal with the downward trend in the market.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to abandon oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, in an effort to increase capacity after its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour shortages in the North Sea for a generation.
He said the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the Mediterranean and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few", says Anderson.
The new projects in the North Sea are expected to cost less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler is measuring the speed of stars in the Pleiadian constellation .
The newest task of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the speeds of stars in the Pleiadian constellation to date.
Using the new data, astronomers can determine why stars in the same galaxy orbit at different speeds and how orbital times relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results to other galaxies, we will learn more about the relationship between the weight and age of the star and even the history of its solar system", says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian constellation is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the galaxy were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching adulthood.
They're spinning faster than ever.
At its peak, the stars that grow up are bursting with massive amounts of stellar air.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they travel through the star's magnetic fields.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of the identifiable starbursts (corresponding to the sunbursts).
The latest data on the speed of rotation listed indicate that the larger stars are moving slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers. Bigger ones spin more slowly than smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiadian 'dance' that slow-spinning stars are typically larger, while the fastest-spinning stars are typically very light", says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian galaxy is so close together, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars relative to their orbital velocities.
"The Pleiadian constellation provides a supporting pillar for theoretical models of the rotation of younger and older stars", says Rebull.
We want to know more about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop "dancing".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Pleiadian rotational speeds in three new articles to be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
