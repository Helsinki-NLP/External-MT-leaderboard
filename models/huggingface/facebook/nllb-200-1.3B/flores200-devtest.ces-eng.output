This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed axis called the rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - the researchers concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or display, and the scientists believe that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not young ones.
Scientists believe that although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, it is a sample of the feathers of an adult animal, not the dusty feathers of a young.

In France, voting is traditionally done without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope, stating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts an envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a rather strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes were found in them before the beginning of voting and that no envelopes other than those inserted by the voter's count and credentials were added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the entire process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, told reporters that no further information would be provided until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will be related to border disputes in which Palestine wants to keep the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects involved seem to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the treaty, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were under close ranger supervision during the PEST study as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Sporting Shooters Association), qualified volunteers were recruited under the auspices of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shootings received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country to new elections.
The Commission represented Martelli's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure of the election and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 equipment-related accidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay "really regrettable".
The quake struck in Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were soon released, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced the elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While Liggins worked at the hospital, he began to work on preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that when given a hormone, it accelerates the maturation of the fetus' lungs.
The Sin-chua news agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday discovered two black boxes with flight logs.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, Luna died on the night that there were two moons in the sky, unique, as she was, a strong woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman, and she was a great woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels said Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I loved her and I'll miss her... maybe she's somewhere better.
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disagreed with Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during her campaign in the 2010 federal election that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
34 percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for extremist views in the survey, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his objections, his eligibility was questioned.
He couldn't take the pain medicine he needed, because drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water supply on Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed since the comets hit the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and recklessness".
There's speculation that he's going to try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology, which enables air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
No emergency services will be introduced, no overhead railway will be built at Wembley, no parking or parking-and-ride facilities available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation options have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was expected to take much longer, because of the breeding of endemic finches, Darwin's middle finches, and migratory cactus and coniferous finches.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be pulled into thin wire that can be bent and braided, or it can be split or pressed into sheets.
It can be processed to a considerable thickness and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it is often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry tablets together and then use your clean wet hands to make a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which men and women frequented together.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite to make the call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces its signal back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and field of view.
To take a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a big rocket that measures over 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in ways that have never been seen before, and the most important thing it has done is to make transportation easier and faster.
He brought us trains, cars, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) whose main diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the ecological no-go system, which means that each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, living in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to 30 females and young.
Females are usually closely related and represent a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can scream.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion with a full throat, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than the ocelot itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, which allows them to sense the direction of movement on the ground.
They can see very well at night, thanks to their night vision, and they can move very quietly, hunting by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or a river or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or ways of adaptation to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which people breathe out.
Plants feed on the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it didn't fear anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered by more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set of teeth planted on the top floor, meaning that nothing that crossed his path had a chance to escape.
We don't know for sure, but they could have had a broken tongue, and their diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meal compositions, including wild boar, peacock, grasshopper, and a type of rodent called a plush.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their meals sitting on chairs, while rich men liked to have a feast together and lie on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia until later centuries.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which were considered their home.
People sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which was open only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurats were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't that important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite the discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although all countries were part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence, there was a treasure map.
Although the document has a note on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence contains the words The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that the large parchment document (29 3⁄4 x 24 1⁄2-inch) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was simply added as a sticker.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had cooperated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, which was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
Civilization is a certain culture, shared by a significant large group of people who live and work in cooperation with each other, i.e. together they form society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means "civil", and it's related to the Latin word civis, which means "citizen", and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it defines the size of society in a way.
The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and the appropriate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress as its sole component, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state agencies to enforce laws, which often did not cooperate.
Nor did it have any power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, and only then could they be amended. The states took the central government lightly, so much so that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world, and in 2006 Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic trials.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands, and the largest of these is Honshu, making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
In view of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes referred to in a geographical sense as a "mainland".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwest Taiwan, beginning a transformation of the original grain-producing practices, employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the southwest and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonosek Peace Treaty, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main spires: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analog film era.
They're still being made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has taken over the digital camera's sensor formats.
Although it's a bit confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio in integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and derided rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamics in the image while maintaining order.
According to this specification, the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired wealth and power, became the object of close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christian religions united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the money resources of the church are there for that very purpose.
The central authority of the church in Rome for over 1,000 years, this concentration of power and money, has led many to question whether this principle has been fulfilled.
Soon after the clashes broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain was crossing international waters to prevent any ships from reaching the entire ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with only limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine military force.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
As witnesses to the horror and cruelty of World War I, nations longed to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (the supervisor from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, with the most famous being the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Qing dynasties.
During these periods, there was a ruthless war between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in the struggle for the throne in the great palace of Si'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, for instead of rank based on class, it now depends on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their own countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the realm of worldly life, and often visited the cave known as Hira on a mountain called Noor (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual orientation.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if you knew it existed, because inside the cave it's completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the beautiful clear sky and the numerous surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The upward-slipped mark looks like a V and the downward-slipped mark looks like a clip or a square with no underside.
Up means you start at the tip and you press the loop, down means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the loop) and you pull the loop.
Moving upwards usually produces a softer sound, while moving downwards is more powerful and penetrating.
You can write your own labels on the paper, but keep in mind that printed labels have their own purpose from a musical point of view, so they should usually be followed.
On October 6, 1789, frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and Queen Elizabeth's sister, Philippine, were forced by a mob of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, which surrounded an angry mob, shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of the criminal gang waved the head of the royal guard to the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, with interest on the bonds flowing in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
The extra surplus value derived from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines would, of course, constitute the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which are generally considered to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or the technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an "impact" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that if motor vehicles appear, it will inevitably lead to the development of roads.
But the national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, which causes new medical techniques to be invented to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, because they were consistent with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its importance declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders brought back to Europe valuables such as silk and spices, which were more valuable at home than they were on the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication, Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style, and one of the greatest advances of that time was the use of buttons to tie clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
Self-sustaining farming is farming carried out to produce only the quantity of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sustaining farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures connect like-minded individuals who feel left out by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often show their membership through the expressive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized as adults.
Some werewolf babies were imprisoned for long periods of time (usually by their own parents), in some cases they were abandoned because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children could experience severe abuse or trauma, and then be abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised as animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully raised by nonhuman animals, a wild child exhibits almost identical behaviour (within physical limits) as a given caretaker animal, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
The Kostra is not a teaching method but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who undertake the acquisition of new practice, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of ladder, but also a little clip in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual Builds designed to analyse, motivate and explain procedures that might be too difficult for the student himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that lacks proper nutrition, care, and education, but such cases do exist.
We believe the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to cover all needs that were not met in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are proposed as important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal engagement' and 'continuous interest' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighme and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micromessages  facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
In particular, you can tell if the other person is lying by correctly interpreting the micro-virus.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge honesty.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutations add a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination blur in both directions the differences between the two sets within each generation.
For primates with digestive systems similar to humans, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources that are available in open savannah.
And if they don't, the consequences are dire: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be protein in leaves and beans, but these are hard for us primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides high amounts of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors were tackling the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as they force a person to get up and go to the toilet.
The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good the life force brings. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only thing that's stopping us from achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple in principle, they are the kundalini of yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened by the yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for another 40 years, and it actually fought with proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian outskirts.
But those plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the troops invaded eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the navy was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but at the same time the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this operation, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies failed, then Germany might be able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and often were watched by shepherds, often children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the trail was mostly made up of parallel boards, it allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on other, somewhat thicker trails of the time.
Barbed wire was introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually found that the rails were more efficient when they had an iron belt on their surface.
This became commonplace, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron railways were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
Dimensionally, they are found in fossil Australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
In many cases, it's the same as symptomatic treatment, but unless we're just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and get rid of it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of human scientific and technological progress, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After passing Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now called Dunlap prints.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Statue of Independence.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The earliest known surviving copies of the document are the Dunlap broadsides, or 25 prints from Dunlap's printing press.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's still a lot of dinosaur-like features on the birds.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information processing encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are represented as binary digits  or bits in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are too common to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the description for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both insidious and beetles are tame, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can decide on a plan to adopt their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the child's parents can become another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the guiding principle of most scientific research.
An experiment is a test that is used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but for scientific research, it's also important to ask questions and observe.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior are often fundamentally dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillators that continue in the time of a free-flowing cycle even without the presence of external stimuli.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the major pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either labeled DNA in the radioactive phase with phosphorus or labeled a protein in the radioactive phase with sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells of the germline have been affected.
Only mutations in the germ line of cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks and studying information on the ecosystem concerned.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to work, and in the meantime, others pass by, heading to work from where they had just left.
In this dynamic transport by shuttle, everyone is involved and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has upended the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely encounter such a level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is it something deeper?
Operations is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Traffic flow is unfortunately difficult to study because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, the operation usually has some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships between three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and more efficient in finding food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, they are the only insect that cannot fold wings, scales, and gills.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moves around the earth.
That makes sense, because you don't get the idea that the Earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, flowing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles in some places.
The Amazon River is responsible for 20 percent of the water that flows from our rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon's main stream is 6,387 kilometers long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in either size or technical precision of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the relics of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, since these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be relatively easily extracted with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four clusters of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they would change into new substances that would form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that the dot at the end of this sentence would fit into trillions of them.
That is why the pencil, after its invention, has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and secondary use.
People are now texting on computer screens so they can't get in touch with the clipboard.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to keep a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like driving a heavy truck up a hill, and then you split the nucleus and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust.
The crust is strong for about 70 km on the reverse side and about 100 km on the reverse side.
It's weaker under the sea, and stronger under the mountains.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas, because the crust is thinner, so the lava could easily reach the surface.
Content theory is about finding out what people can relate to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do those things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues  peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and leading people to accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're going to be unrecognizable and you're going to feel like you have to change everything that the team does and do it your way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This discussion often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as the contact points of their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of the so-called 'invisible team' (Larson  LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
An invisible team is a management team to which each member is subordinate.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity can be demonstrated when all available resources are effectively used across the functional components of the organisation.
As a result, the process of a cooperative organisation overcoming a barrier can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
To be innovative, an organisation's management must create an innovative corporate culture, introduce knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used by organisations to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of the pineal gland, narrowing and refining this area of research.
Scientists in their research support the interconnection between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to observe and study brain structures and processes that no one has ever observed before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connections to science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is embedded in a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every subject, and the teacher would often like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual excursion sharing is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and every year they revamp the site, but the old versions stay online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing, and while their blogging is often marked by sloppy spelling at the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also encourages students to have an overview of the world around them.The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend education beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs allows students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their views on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, the beauty of the Muskoka region and others are still waiting to be discovered.
All of this and much more underscores that Ontario is a foreign country considered to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people will be surprised by the following statistic about the population: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of wildlife it can be considered a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to these countries, and it did well in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by the Sahel in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Wives: It is recommended that all travelers identify themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful not to make it look too expensive).
Women should remember that because of cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment and that it is not uncommon for a man to watch a woman walk, hold her hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't excuse it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city at Dar el-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as charcoal, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of brushes, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out in view of the current state of fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
The usual fare for a short trip in Goma is about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Timbuktu is a poor city today, but thanks to its reputation as a tourist attraction, it also has its own airport.
In 1990, because of the desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS show Divy Africa World, hosted by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the cities in the country because it seems more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of the JAR and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there is a fee to enter the park and a contribution to the conservation of nature.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider to be a major travel destination.
The display of buildings that make up the urban landscape of Hong Kong is likened to a glittering column graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the dense urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the site that was appropriated by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest strip of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stretches of mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately one third is covered by water areas or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian tigers can currently be found in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day long, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, we recommend buying a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are served by small Japanese shore buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 232 feet [83 m], the bridge is 1,378 feet [378 m] long, and it has two lanes of 3.5 feet [3.5 m] in width.
The vertical light height below the bridge is 15 metres.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the area we now know as eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing self-sustaining agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payagua, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounters of Spanish conquerors with groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Minor tournaments and matches are also available at other times of the year.
If you're interested in tournaments and where to get tickets to polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, but you may be able to use British or American currency, so be sure to ask your creditors in advance what payment method you can use.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make the exchange before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is here when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; normal temperatures in the summer months are above 30 °C.
Winters can be deviously freezing: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but together with wind and humidity, the air seems colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most animals in the park are used to humans, they are still wild animals in the wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wildlife!
Though peaceful on the face of it, buffalo, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Many visitors are injured every year because of not keeping proper distances, and these animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so leave them their space.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wildlife attract odors, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous naval stalemate of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, given that Auckland is situated between two harbours, the most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in North Harbour County) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located off the coast of Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
They're sometimes populated family beaches with a large selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better choices.
Tap water is fine, but if you're afraid, there's usually bottled water available.
The idea of flat white coffee is foreign to Australians, with the small black being espresso, the cappuccino being full of cream (not foam), and the tea being served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're top-notch.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
Still, take the advice of authorities, follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The four-toed sloths are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of Seventeen Seventy, and can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The sea crocodile does not live actively in the ocean, its primary refuge being the mouth of the river north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives travellers the assurance that they will have a place to stay at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can also be booked through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transport or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also support you with your reservation if you need time to think about it or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any amendments or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp on site and most participants consider this to be a necessary part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you'll have to get there as soon as possible to get a camping spot that's close to the music production.
Remember that while the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival music may continue into the late night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you're going to cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because sailing through ice creates unbearable noise in exposed places.
St. Petersburg round-trip cruises include time in the city.
Casinos usually try to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, and often lack windows and clocks, and it's often difficult to find a way out.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep visitors in a good mood and in the casino's premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the company's behalf, but drunkenness negatively affects judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or in a mountain pass had to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction on icy and snow-covered roads is low, so you can't drive as well as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make it impossible to ride.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or by landslides or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and for many tourists it is the highlight of the trip.
The term safari in the familiar sense of the word refers to a journey by land to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with a telescope.
A tourist safari consists of a walking tour lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at various locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted as early as 1964.
If you booked your 2020 tickets and accommodation before the delay was announced, this may be a difficult situation for you.
Event cancellation rules may vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based event cancellation rules did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2 500 and 130 000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7 000 Japanese yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry him out, and many hotels have a stationary iron and ironing board available for rent, even if they are not directly in the room.
If an ironing board is not available or you do not like to wear ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause crushing or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes a minute, in others, several minutes.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests they do not know in their home regions.
A difficult insect can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or in worse cases, allergic reaction, spread of poison, or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill a person are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other charges in the areas concerned.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when buying products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, often passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep angles, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are the norm.
The maximum speed allowed is significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to it is even more important.
Interestingly, though, mobile phone services here are far better than in many sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, very similar to their southern neighbours in Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples used throughout the year, followed by cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds and fox nuts, and the popular pastries are often especially good for a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some rich sweets, try the pastries, which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dry or wet depending on how much fluid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an overarching concept that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, this term usually refers to cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simple dishes, with peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The trunks on either side of the saddle serve as a support for the rider's legs.
They provide riders with greater stability, but may be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but his leg gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, the rider may pull behind.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole that is fairly narrow.
Some saddles, especially English, also have safety skis that allow the strap to fall off the saddle when the falling rider pulls behind it.
Chochamó Valley  Chile's prime minister's favorite mountaineering destination known as South America's Yosemite, where you can find extensive granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the mountains offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes thanks to the endless potential of its walls.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports consisting of downhill skiing or snowboarding on snow-covered terrain attached to the legs.
"Skiing is a frequent travel activity with many fans sometimes known as ""ski-wanders"", who plan their entire holidays by skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old, cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational ski club being opened by the Norris in Australia in 1861.
Ski tourism: This activity is also referred to as ski tourism, ski tourism or ski tours.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although not part of this activity, the latter being done on rugged terrain and requiring far more sturdy skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar tourist trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover a little more than a distance on foot  but you will rarely move at the speed you would on a backpack-less run and in a controlled foot.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a number of independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, operates in this respect similarly to a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without re-passing passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antiques, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, where for example the age limit in North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items may be classified as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Rearing livestock is an important livelihood for the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sami people traditionally raised reindeer in large numbers, and they also subsisted by fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, and used reindeer only as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.

You may prefer to look to the advice of other governments rather than your own, but it is primarily for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
The views presented are often confusing, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it takes different forms depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

The course usually covers all the problems described in greater detail, usually in the form of practical exercises.
The course usually lasts 25 days and includes role-playing training, in-depth first aid instruction and sometimes weapons handling.
Books and magazines on wildlife survival are common, but there is little publication on war zones.

Backflow is the wave coming back and hitting the beach, often at the cliff, etc.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, and it is here that a fast flow into deep water can be created.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away again, or according to your ability and depending on whether you've been spotted, you'd better wait for help.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is a smaller initial enthusiasm phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture often have a particularly difficult experience of readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home from abroad, you are used to a new culture and have already lost some of the habits of your home.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country must adapt.
People may not realize that even travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The Pyramid Light and Sound Show is one of the most exciting things to do for kids in the area.

The mountains of the peninsula here merge into a plateau, and then reappear to form the 200-mile-long Ellsworth Range, which is split in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or Sentinel ridge is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the 4,892-meter-high peak of Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a cell phone, because to make a call, you have to be outside without any obstructions between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping including recreational craft and expeditions that require remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Travel and study are becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off.
It's especially popular with people who graduate from school, allowing them to take a year off before going to university without jeopardizing their education.

Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal islands.
It is not necessary to have a yacht on islands and lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaking offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland  one boat for every seven to eight people.
It is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this number is one in forty).
Baltic voyages usually have longer stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit this historic city for several days and then return to the boat at night and spend the night there.
If you are only going ashore on cruises, you will not need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include Berlin, Germany.As shown on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the tour.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome fear of the unknown or a feeling that the situation is out of control.
Freight forwarders are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies have a problem.
If they were to send goods by air freight, then on some routes it could take several days for the goods to go through unloading and customs control.
The only way to do this faster is to send the item as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly first or business class is to pull out a big bag of money (even better is to get your company to do it for you).
But it is not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the standard price of a business-class ticket and 11 times the price of a first-class ticket!
In general, it is not worthwhile to look for discounts on flights from point A to point B for first or business class.
The airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and prices correspond to that.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has been plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

In addition to many more common species, rare fauna can be found here, such as brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and zebra.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries provide pledges to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own pledges, especially the colorful ones, you'll be served by a monk or nun at the entrance with a smile.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can borrow these from the storefront, but these clothes don't wash after every use, so you don't feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like the cuisines of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever ingredients are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie (you), are always capitalized at the beginning, and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.

However, people who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that they do not need to study it separately.
The observatories of the pre-modern era are mostly obsolete today and serve as museums or educational centers.
Because light pollution at their peak was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge devices in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms known as hanami has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were a favorite flower.

Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have also been adopted by non-Christians in Christendom and by non-Christians worldwide.
There's a tradition where people wake up on Easter night in some exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may just as well be a pre-Christian celebration of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during Easter weekend, when the congregation often bursts into celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands were brought there by swimming, flying, or by wind or sea currents.

Since man's arrival, a number of mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience a polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This offers a convenient opportunity to observe the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less all the time.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is usually not a problem, you will enjoy a view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
The standard business attire is a suit, and employees refer to each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, and rather than praising individual achievements, emphasis is placed on group effort.
