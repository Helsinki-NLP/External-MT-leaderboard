Let me see.
Tom was beginning to realize what was happening.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of supplies.
Not here.
No one was happy.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I tried to sleep.
Tom is always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just texted me.
Tom's somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.

When do you want to leave?
There's got to be some kind of logic.
Did you work yesterday?

I have a question.
What else was there?
Tom said that Mary was probably still doing that.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me leave early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's going to be quite cold tonight.
I'm not going to ask Tom for help.
How much did you pay to do that?
You don't have to stay.

It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost all of us.
Tom needs to be home by 2:30.
Do you walk to school?
Is that Tom's girlfriend?

I was just going to wash up.
Have a good one!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me to be on her team.
No one is listening anymore.
You are brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit him over there.
Put it down.

What is she like?
A pickpocket took Mark's passport.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including shipping.
I'm going to miss you.
I sat on a bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come by tomorrow.
What kind of insects did you eat?
I saw Tom get hit by a car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees that.
I got on the wrong bus.
I declined the offer.
Mary has already done what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
Have you reserved a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about a picnic?
We couldn't buy tickets to the concert until we got money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I am a Palestinian.
I can't do this alone.
Tom needs you here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place cannot experience the pleasure of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a Coke and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's something wrong with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Are you all right?
You may be the only one who can do it.
Who's wrong?
Your singing makes professional singers blush with shame.
You know Tom is lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom is a bully.
He was big.
Tom knows that Mary didn't do it.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
Do you want me to ask him?
Tom and I aren't afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We are busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how to do that.
Are you drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began on the fifth day.
Mary said she liked doing that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew that Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got a bill for electricity.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do that.
All members are required to be present.
Are you uncomfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree with you.
I'm very fortunate.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She was crying bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
Sami will find out.
A witness who has seen with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is done.
When I went into the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very kind.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to arrive?
Tom ironed his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We should call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party was?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll have a bite.
I don't want to anymore.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom will be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, I would love to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
Spring is coming.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's turn around.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you scared?
You ruined my life.
We need to invent a secret language.
Are you planning to stay long?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My children are at school.
I put my suitcase away.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old. I'm not old.
I'm thinking of you.
I was just doing my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant oasis.
Put salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat lunch.
I'm not accusing anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
Tom speaks French quite fluently.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped himself dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
This is a bracelet.
I have plenty of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need the facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Tom is leaving Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss each other.
Millions of people die each year from hunger.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
The letter had the wrong address.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all in the chocolate.
They have changed their religion.
I should be more careful.
I was just jumping them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he up to?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He is a strange person.
I just got my hair cut.
Mary said that she had never learned French.
I think I'm going to buy a new car.
It's our own fault.
You are so sweet.
It'll cost about fifteen dollars.
I knocked on the door.
His theory is worth considering.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
This is not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She is a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You were singing.
I did everything perfectly.
I like to write.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
I'm going to be sixteen next month.
Do you think there's a chance that's going to happen?
Accept your dreams.
What time does your last lesson end?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's wrong with her?
How was the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We have to help Tom.
It rained all day.
I was upset about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom is going to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy the flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Keep your voice down.
The sun shines by day and the moon by night.
I'm getting the hang of it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have a right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I'm having problems with my boss.
This is a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Is Mary your girlfriend?
London was in the fog.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to see him off.
Get out of the way.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't be angry.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brasilia.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay the phone bill.
Tom can cook.
But the music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve a break.
These are fresh.
Tom has huge eyes.
The oars have seven colors.
I don't think Tom should be doing this.
He is gloomy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his honest opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
That's where you or Jane should go.
I'd ignore that if I were you.
Tom will be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm joking around?
I was very tired today.
I'm being honest.
Happiness does not consist in having many things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom pointed to the side of the mountain.
The taxi is here.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
This is mine.
How strange!
Can you read Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a dick.
Did Tom give you something for me?
I could never have done this without your help.
I always have coffee and a glass of wine for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat breakfast.
I'm the best.
How did your exam go?
Can I pay later?
Did that just happen?
Mary didn't take her umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
The truth is, I lied.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can I borrow your tweezers?
This is your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
Patrick can't write properly.
I was too embarrassed.
I went into detail.
Tom said he didn't want to do that.
Let's go to the aquarium.
Do you know what the problem is?
Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry. She doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We are comfortable in our new home.
There are only two things in the world that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy".
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
You reap what you sow.
What are you staring at?

I was born that way.
Tom and I ran in the races.
He came home late in the evening.

There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how are you?
The password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take out the trash.
You're my friend.
He has two cars.
They've got it.
It's all right.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!

Thank her for her help.

What are you doing tomorrow?
This is my wife, Edith.
This student is an American.

All dogs are animals. But that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
Those who can only think of one way to spell a word obviously lack imagination.
I am confident of his success.
Tom didn't do that.
Where is the nearest subway station?
Tom ran out the window.

I think you've said enough.
I'm a customer. I'm not a customer.
I'm very greedy.
You are crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
Answer me now.
I suspected Tom was homesick.
Tom hasn't done that since last year.
Are you done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
No one has seen Tom.

Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he didn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where is Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
Why on earth would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth's magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
This is Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
I'm not wearing anything.
Are you planning on doing that somehow?
Am I making myself clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom will probably be punished for doing that.
Tom is happy no matter what.
No need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
At first I didn't believe him.
The phone is not working right now.
Tom is with his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get in there.
Tom could be fined if he does that.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really unreasonable.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he had seen John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?

Thank you for your help.

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

The party's over.
A unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look over there, there's a shark!" "It's a whale, Tom".
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very hospitable.
I'm a nerd, you know.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my fault, not Tom's.
The meetings went well.
The wind blows from the ocean this time of year.
I saw Tom smile.
Go on, get out of here!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and beat up that bully.

I'm good at that.
Why did he quit?
Tom said that Mary had left.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased opinion is that this is a terrible movie.
You are very elegant.
As you wish.
I could change.
This is important.

I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do this?
I hope you come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
You can't buy love.
If you didn't want to come, you should have said something.
I'm ready to work.
What the hell is this theater?

I can't keep up with you.
Mary dances well.
My grandfather is from Osaka.

Will it snow tonight?
Is this fun for you?
Are you seeing someone here?
I live in Milan.
When has she ever done anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of two  is an irrational number.

We can't do without water.
I can't get my head together.

She lives in the village.

Give me a little nudge.
You are disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom claims he's satisfied.
How are you feeling now?
How many boys are in your class?
These are big apples.
Choose your gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us time.
Do not interrupt our conversation.

You've been to London three times.
I'll be back in a minute.

Happy new year!
You'll see for yourself.
I never killed anyone.
How do you pronounce your name?
She holds flowers in her hand.
Have you spoken to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man is over ninety.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get this?
Are we done here?
Are you from Boston?
Did you know her since 1990?
You're good at that, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I borrow your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom is special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What's the matter?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
We were ready to attack.
When's the party?
Did you help?

Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I asked her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom is doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
It's nice to meet you, Tom.
This is the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do that.
I don't expect them to win.
I fell asleep.
How is this my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you ever been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm learning Vietnamese.
I'm going to meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off his loan debt.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.

No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me with this.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You will be happy.
Tom looked pretty sick the last time I saw him.

What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the counter red?
No, this isn't my house.
You speak French fluently, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You don't speak French, do you?
You're not like that.
Let's go home now.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took off his wedding ring.
I'll arrange breakfast for you.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a little outdated.
