Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid of not being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently appalled over a proposal to change their names from assembly member or AM (assembly member) to member of the Welsh parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came as a result of plans to change the name of the national assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculous.
A Labour member said his group was concerned about the MWP numbers on Twp and Pwp
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp means beish.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group ikkje is happy and has proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group had an "open mind" when it came to name change, but added that MWP was not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which is now writing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the National Assembly should be called will of course be up to the members themselves".
A 2017 official decision by the Welsh Assembly gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals that showed great support for calling the assembly the Welsh parliament.
When it comes to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the delegation preferred Welsh parliament members or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have reportedly come up with other proposals, but the struggle to become one has given the delegation's leader, Elin Jones, a lead role.
The legislative consolidation of the reforms also includes other changes to the way the delegation should function, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Members of the House of Representatives will be able to vote on what they will call when they debate the bill.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was intended to resolve a conflict that had been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are set while the churches in Harlem, New York, are striving
"The old man I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
Today none of the parts exist.
He said he understood why the children disappeared.
"People are socializing in other ways now", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's usual places of worship.
As for the churches, he is worried that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders believe, and sooner or later they are back where they started.
He added that churches can be replaced by shared facilities filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic sites in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy shares in these buildings are white", he said. "And so will the day when all churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that these people who move into the shares will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black borough - Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock who had preached in the area moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem where owners were opposed to assigning or promoting black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clockwork game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor to Saint Martin, was proud and called the clock the clock of the poor.
The expert who played on the clock in July called it something else: a cultural asset and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the world's first clock to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play at the larger clock in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months has become a complex narrative of architects and construction workers, some of whom have been assigned by the leaders of the lay people of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which leads the sect and consists of the leaders of the lecturer, wrote to the bishopric in July with concerns that the bishopric would ask the sacristy to pay, even though the sacristy was not involved in the bishopric's appointment of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the sock have complained about the lack of openness of the bishopric.
13-year-old injured by shark under lobster in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while he was digging for hummingbirds in California on the opening day of the hummingbirds season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been scuba diving with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to have caught a hen, before he realized that the boy was yelling 'Bite me!
Something is biting me!
"His entire collarbone was torn off", Hammel said, observing when he reached the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water,'" Hammel added.
The patient was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is critical.
It's unclear what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Badevakt captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a couple of weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles caused the boy serious injuries to the overbody.
Authorities shut down access to water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different shark species in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
The Sainsbury's grocery store offers beauty products
The British chain Sainsburys will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer large store services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continuing to grow while fashion and interior salons are falling, Sainsbury's will test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with televisions, microwave ovens and interiors are now empty.
Sainburys said they would double the number of beauty products to 3,000 and offer the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
They will give the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands more space and have separate areas for each brand as in Boots-butiques.
The store will also be re-launching its own Boutique make-up and make most of its products vegan, attracting more young customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test the sale of its perfume in two of Sainsbury's' stores, the first in Croydon, London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops means that large chain stores must find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like large magazines, while the chain of stores is trying to fight the low-priced stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has partnered with the Argos interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought both chains two years ago.
The store's earlier attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's cooperated with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, which owned 281 pharmacies and Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an expanded luxury line of leather products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We've changed the way beauty shelves will look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also hired colleagues with special competencies who should be able to offer beauty tests.
Our brands are designed to meet all needs, while the attractive environment and convenient location means we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of doing business.
Peter Jones' surprise after Holly Willoghby withdrew from an £11 million deal
The star of the television show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is astonished after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million lifestyle deal to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to promote their interior and accessory Truly.
The pair's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning made the news on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' star Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of their new lifestyle brand collaboration to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "astonishing" when the golden Holly confessed during an effortless meeting on Tuesday in Jones's business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she no longer had time to collaborate on the interiors and accessories Truly.
The partnership has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she would not work with Truly, while Jones fled Britain to calm down in one of her vacation homes.
A source said: Truly was definitely on top of Holly's priorities.
It was her long-term plan for the future, and it would last for many decades.
Her decision to retire has surprised everyone involved.
Nobody believed their own ears on Monday, Truly was so close to launching.
There is a warehouse in Marlow full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the decision by This Morning host, who is one of the richest stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to massive product investments, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and could cause delays with the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S' brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin, who hosts ITV's Im A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business".
♪ We talk hard ♪ And we fall in love ♪
He criticized the media for commenting on what some might experience as "upresident" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his twisted voice as a "news reader".
I've never given up on anything.
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step toward the disarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
But the nuclear weapons program has stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not received a "equivalent response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continues to impose sanctions to pressure North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea", he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He added that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the end of the rocket-testing, aid to the release of hostages and the return of the American soldiers' lives.
He defended his unusual progress in his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there", Trump said, pointing at the group that was standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate islands and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's inhabitants had to flee, no one declared a national crisis, which is necessary to obtain international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it's a bit challenging", Sumbung said.
While Redd Children has assembled a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign-bound employees will be allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, spokesman for the agency for national crises in Indonesia, said the authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, it is not particularly prepared for natural forces.
In Aceh, they have built refuge areas for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite the warning of tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more casualties.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will spend at least three days on reaching the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the infrastructure of Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railroads.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also pressured by sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking it up and against the goal.
The attempt sailed high over the penalty field and fauked towards the upper right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq were trying to get as far as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and lose the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after the scoring in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he spanned from place near the midfield and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic took the ball fast on the midfield.
Then he shot it in a pleasant way and led Hazard into the penalty field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defence and scored with his left foot right past keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15pm on Thursday in London.
The number of victims in the Indonesia-tsunamien rises to 832
The number of victims of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's crisis bureau reported earlier Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 metres, followed by 6 metres high waves, the crisis bureau's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman was found murdered in Birkenhead, Merseyside, earlier today.
The 44-year-old woman was found knifstuk at 07:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, while a 32-year-old man has been arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have sought local residents' tips about the incident.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in an early stage, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also encourage everyone, including taxi drivers, who can capture something on the dashboard camera, to contact us in case they have important information.
A police officer confirmed that the woman who was found was from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that they will not be allowed to enter their homes for many hours.
Someone overheard a police officer telling a man that the whole area is one place.
A woman came to the place crying.
She says again and again, "It's so horrible".
At 14 a.m., two police vehicles were seen inside the band and one outside.
A number of policemen stood within the police force and observed a block of flats.

Parliament statue of Cromwell is the last victim of the transcription of history.
The removal of the statue would have been the karma of Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England by his puritans during the civil war of the 16th century.
However, the Cromwell-Federation described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as a "screening" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Federation, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should become a goal.
The Iconoklasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's outstanding representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century public opinion, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider to be worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, seen as a defender of the Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual we know represented on one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and memory.
Murderer-gigs attack and kill Chinese farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, local media reports said.
The man, whose surname was Yuan, was found dead, with his pulse cut and covered in blood, near a pig's nest on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to give pigs vaccines on a yard on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the door of one of the pigs was open.
He said that in the binge there was a large hanngris with blood around the mouth.
The obduction showed that a 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and devastated", the cousin, named Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while police collected evidence of the whereabouts.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such attacks by pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer held a 295 kilogram pig between himself and a tractor until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them, he said.
Remains of the hurricane Rosa bring rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted in the weather report, the storm Rosa will weaken over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring with her pøsregn to northern Mexico and southwest United States the next few days.
Rosa had winds of up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 a.m. eastern time zone on Sunday, and the hurricane's center was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
In the middle ages, a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States, reaching near the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and moving tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 centimeters can create dangerous flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest United States; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flows can occur due to spread terreng and tropical rain.
It is warned against tours of the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can turn cloudy rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The next low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small flows and smooth paths.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Tropical rain towns will begin in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect heavy rain on Thursday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature swings throughout the United States while the Arctic gets colder, but tropical regions will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There's almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days will be a late summer heat trying to build up and spread again.
Much of central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start on October, with 25 degrees upwards from the southern portion of the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Thursday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term response indicates high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
Simultaneously, the political discussion surrounding the case continued, with interruptions in the usual television programs of various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI during the next week should investigate the charges.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh ordered her to drink and try to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional interrogation, that he was 100 percent sure that it wouldn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company came up with this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels that broadcast the broadcast, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of viewers watching an American football final or the Oscar.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the most-watched during the day with 5,69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared himself on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protestors shouted after him on his way to a hearing with a judges committee on Friday.
He stood and watched on the floor for several minutes while the protestants were talking to him on CNN live.
'I'm standing right here in front of you,' said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth about our country?
Some said to him, "You have power, but so many women have powerlessness".
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before he went into the heater he said he wanted to have more meaning during the committee hearing.
The circling bureaus showed the hearing on television when the judges' committee voted for or against Kavanaugh's nomination to the full senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh within the next week, which the Democrats have also demanded.
Flake was partly persuaded after talking to his friend, the Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators thereafter, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to be powerful, because it was clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for likening politics to Brexit
Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, blames her plans to leave the EU on her critics for "similar policies" with the future of Britain without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend her Conservative party's conference on 29 September 2018.
Next to the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times is an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he attacks the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect each other's taxes is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest the suspected Dyteon Simpson for the Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and jailed for premeditated murder, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, say.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is affiliated with CBS.
After the Simpson hearing, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports local newspaper The Advocate.
The coroner in east Baton Rouge made public an early obduction report on Friday that showed the cause of death was a headshot that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge Police Department thanks the Louisiana State Police's special forces, the State Police's crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "awake in the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2, 6-foot-4 basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points with 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "trustless" after Wayde was killed.
"That's something we're always afraid of", Wade said.
A volcano spits ash over Mexico City
Oske from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The national crisis prevention center urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and osceous emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumlings and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of osque on cars in various neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police joined forces with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators for independence joined forces with police, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the vote on eventual liberation from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while they threw eggs and powder lacquer that created dark clouds of dust in streets usually filled with tourists.
The same situation broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists cried, "Let there be no forgetfulness, no forgiveness, while the protestants against independence cried, 'Long live Spain.'"
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries following the protests.
The vote is still printed in the region and many will still have independence one year after the October 1 vote, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low violence among those who opposed independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the vote and violent clashes broke out in the region.
Groups that were too independent slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went off the stack, however, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said he no longer has any hope of independence in Catalonia.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy to be able to vote for independence, but now we're stuck again, he said.
Although they won the regional elections earlier in December, the pro-independence Catalan party is struggling to maintain power this year, while many of its leaders are in exile or arrest while awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of police on her phone, said the conflict was being fought by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been a part of ongoing lawsuits since last year, declared that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"STOYING as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state", he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: People arrested for deliberately crashing into houses
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after deliberately crashing into a house in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
An armbrust may have been used to shoot the car.
Menga-shot gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Resigned Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second win after 18 games training for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side jammed with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side have no outscorers in the Scottish Premiership this season, and will play against Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and head coach Holt has not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against the away team
Holt's team was supposed to have led long before they scored, and created more problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort toward goals, which meant that Alan Lithgow had to work hard after meeting Craig Halkett's heading over goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers joined a frispark and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
Before that, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow fled far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Watches were sent back and forth in the Livingston-straffe field, while two punishments - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands - were waved away.
'Fenomenally' by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal fight and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
The players played fantastically and still impress on the upward curve.
Their playing and playing styles have barely changed since their return to top class, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he was training.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the entire match.
Rangers, on the other hand, were not motivated.
Even as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and they only cut down the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they can't do it anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies as they met for breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is expected to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The country has been united in terms of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many of Erdogan's supporters met to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the difference between German Turks, who see Erdogan as a hero, and others, who see him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: A cyclist dies after a collision with a car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred just a couple of months after another cyclist died when the driver left Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the current accident.
The London Police reported that they are identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses must drive around the area, while other drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in a rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison office says.
The ongoing disaster broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special Tornado forces were recruited to quell the uprising, which involved eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison official said: "Specialists must calm the ongoing uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in prison longer.
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner went on strike.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to quell a serious uprising, where prisoners threw billiards of bullets at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (in favor of drought areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is on its way to Arizona early next week, as the remainder of the hurricane Rosa moves southwestward over the desert and creates terror for the stream.
National weather forecasts have issued warnings against flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The Rose is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Thursday, and may rain late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only ti tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona-Grant.
The latest models from the national orkansenter report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can be found between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest region, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside of flood risk, rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the dry season.
Although flood is a serious concern, it is likely that this rain will benefit areas of the southwest United States that are subject to drought.
According to drought monitoring in the United States, extreme drought is in over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa moved over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With winds over 135 kilometres per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves northward at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore calming down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm strength, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
Rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a potential for up to 25 centimeters, weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger to Rosa or the remnants of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American southwest", the national orcan center said.
This rainfall is expected to create life-threatening flows in desert areas and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found in the knifstuk in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have urged people who may have a cell phone record of what happened to contact us.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the slam and angry Democrats were against him
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the merciless and unjustifiable tactics of the Democrats", Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered during the slamming and angry Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying the accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her accusations during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw how brilliant and brave Kavanaugh was that day.
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with faultless public service", he told a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
Fif weeks is one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't say, but I really do", he said.
That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to resist and block.
The Senate's first important vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place late Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, counting on the death toll rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to participate in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, where the waves, six metres high, hit the beach at sunset and took many people while destroying everything they came across.
Tsunamien came after an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people on the beach were still not coming along and were victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's crisis prevention agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami were not enough in itself, he brought with him cars, trestammer, houses; he hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had risen over open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed up into trees to avoid tsunamis and survived that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
A photo of the air published by the crisis bureau shows many ruined buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quake continued to hit the coast on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Bureau of Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, which lies at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of dead and the extent of the devastation could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, the communication is cutting", said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, Red Cross said, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", said Raudekrossen.
The Crisis Bureau was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, although authorities said that waves came within the time frame that had been warned.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately calling people down the streets to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, bringing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video at first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage and cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the emergency response.
The military has begun the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airports were reopened to receive emergency assistance, but will remain closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office.
"They saw many ruined houses", he said.
It's very bad.
While the emergency relief organizations are beginning to assist those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their employees cannot start work before Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's a crisis at the province level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
When the government says OK, this is a national crisis, we can open up to international emergency assistance, but they haven't updated the status yet.
It's evening in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters don't end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building where she had been confined to her dead mother's side for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian Games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Mandagi said that one of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a paragliding expert, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Gendon reportedly desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu paraguayers, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a gray hawk, instead of two blue hawk.
"I think that means the messages didn't come out", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a mini-bank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, a thief stole $26,750 from a worker at Brink's in what he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Levee, U.S., according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The worker had just tossed a minibank in the entertainment area and was in the process of delivering more money, detective Dennis McCarthy said in the press release.
While the worker was busy, a man jumped up behind the worker and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while they fled the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creation formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has had Ye as his nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional reasons", said the host.
In addition to being a shortened form of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think the word "Y" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West said earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio personality Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, that's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we are.
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West earlier, has also changed the spelling of the name with and without a bindestrek and large letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to send military forces against civilians, and the country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, in a time when left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
As China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the US government declared themselves to be artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, and aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, because all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence", Lee said.
A doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will happen in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is executive director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest companies for artificial intelligence, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged earlier technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be, so that he could join and identify the next visionaries.
Scientists in the United States usually have to work hard to get government support, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired excellent university students to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen research into artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students in artificial intelligence should get automatic residency", he said.
The State Council of China published its plan for next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's national science federation funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Foundation and other state organizations' way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on national security and artificial intelligence legislation for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they should change the name of the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim to their territory, and has used its veto to vote against Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has cast doubt on how far the referendum will reach the 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership in the EU and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have said they will follow the results of the vote to make it decisive.
For the change of name to take place, the Parliament needs two-thirds of the vote.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of all registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe", said 62-year-old Gose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumika in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum before the Parliament of Skopje, setting up tents and chairs.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we're not for changing the name of our country", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be called Macedonia, we can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the majority will vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will be members of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after having voted.
He said that a ja-result could be interpreted as a stadfestation of our future.
A poll conducted Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required number.
Another poll by the Macedonian Telma TV channel showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent voted yes.
For the referendum to be successful, at least 50 percent of the vote must be cast, plus one vote.
If the referendum does not succeed, it could damage the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence team, which led to a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spissen received a mid-range watch at the start of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defensive players and reached the open course.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came up with one defense, before he ran past several others on the edge of the Brighton-straffe field.
He passed a left-handed guard and found Sterling.
The English spissen used his first spark in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
Aguero still sleeps with his feet, City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored when he did.
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first lead in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's track.
Sane held the ball while leading Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the goal just before it slipped out of the track.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 a.m. on Wednesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoiler games against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competition instinct, and hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to the playoff for the Rockies, who lead with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but look to lock in the firm division title.
Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such relationships?
It's still unclear who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may be Scherzer will pitch.
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, throws a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3-inning games this season.
Trump gathers voters in West Virginia
The President referred obscurely to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
Everything we've done so far is on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones -- I don't stand, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates, he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you can see it's happening right now.
And they're convinced that they're going to take back power, you can see how ugly they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to oppose and block.
And you can see that based on the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats "silly and mean and disgusting and dishonest".
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I hope -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant of people who say what they mean.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not surprising.
I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told I am not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it comes to how important it is to run a responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar issues like Jeremy ironically probably was united with earlier leaders about.
In the call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.
For the last eight years of my time as Labour MP, Friday's meetings have been just like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of a "slow" policy has been long forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the party leaders.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when my colleagues used to be politically united with the sudden expectation that I would change my mind and be united on issues I would never agree on -- whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly, it doesn't matter what I say, I'm always silenced on social media and people want me to step down while they criticize the policy of the Centre and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who are being subjected to gender discriminatory and racist allegations every day, and who are still professionals and don't give up.
One of the most deceptive aspects of this period is how normalised it has become to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. With every motion of no confidence and every change in the rules of the bargain, the party gets smaller and smaller.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so big, so maybe people will like me better.
But that's not why I chose to get involved in politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still at school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government had failed the country. My classroom was about to collapse, so I wanted better public services for those who needed them most -- whether as a community adviser or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, not even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have doubted what I stand for and which of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country fails to agree to a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care to waste energy questioning my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in fact, the only message I have sent to the Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the electoral circle, whether Labour voters or not, is: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one will make me resign or change my policy and stop me from serving in a way that I believe is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unovercoming Ayr tops the scottish rugby scene
Two signs of the Twenty20s may have changed the outcome a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr has proven itself to be a winner in today's very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now on top of the podium as the only invincible team in all ten.
It was their superb defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be content.
"We have been tested in the last struggle and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be content", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves praise, they were better than us at taking chances".
Grant Anderson had a 14 minute hard drive, in which Frazier Climo tried a conversion, which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors allowed Melrose to assemble, and Jason Baggot took a unconverted try.
Climo was given a penalty right before the break, he scored and converted a solo try to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the slingringsmonnet by five points.
A long pause occurred when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and put on the bar, and from the start Ayr continued on through a stafford McDowall's attempt, which Climo converted.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and Melrose again tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home game played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty spot, MacPherson scored a try.
Climo was converted again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry away from his fifth home.
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, appears ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is a director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, which he writes and plays alongside his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would be involved in the "progressive" restaurant industry in Glasgow.
Bolivia hopes the justice will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We have a right to
and the duty to return to it.
In landlocked Bolivia, people still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century.
These hopes are perhaps stronger than many decades ago, while Bolivia awaits the international court's ruling on October 1, after five years of territory.
"Bolivia has a drive, a sense of purpose and is present, and of course expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are coming to view the international court's decision, hoping that the Hague court will support Bolivia's demands, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - will grant Bolivia an independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who is seeking re-election next year - has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
"Now we'll soon be returning to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some analysts think the court is not going to let Bolivia have access to the ocean -- and that little would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The court's decision comes just six months after the last negotiations, indicating that the case was complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have been far from advancing Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales, with his struggling rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Zárate said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the problem situation after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have the opportunity to open new relations with Chile and a chance to stretch 139 years of unity and rather benefit both, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used this maritime problem to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific", he added.
Dom is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past.
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation cannot be the first to abolish it, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the pledge they made during the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the U.S. foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, appears to want to restart his nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore-based meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues to impose sanctions and opposes an eventual declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to an eventual declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious about deconstruction and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headaches are the last resort on the way to a shopping street near you.
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you don't need to let it go anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a number of large and special masterpieces in their SS19 collection, which astonished audiences during the Paris fashion week.
The most impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a four-inch, brake-like handle that covered the models' heads.
There are also other oversized accessories under the moteshowet, including a jewel-proud watermelon, a troll hat, and even an pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks -- just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks had lips that were sewn together and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled a scuba diving device, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in a cookie.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just enjoy it.
Fashion experts predict that these huge hats are going for sale in a mall near you.
The oversized hats come right after La Bomba, the 60 centimeter-wide straw hat that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was ubiquitous on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a strawstrand bag of the same size as the bikini-clad model who wore her.
The beach, with a color of brent orange and fryncing top with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it's possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known for their high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only reinforced by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to provide the best services to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for higher and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at this year's exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings with the highest standing for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages got A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students got A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who spoke German, 69 percent of those who spoke French, and 63 percent of those who spoke Spanish also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital qualities, which children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages as electives are viewed as equivalent to STEM (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Selection of Employment and Qualifications in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers were unable to fill jobs due to lack of language skills.
That is why language is increasingly important in school to prepare youth for the workplace.
With more job opportunities for language-aware people, these qualities are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever kind of career a young person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a trait.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a 12 percent, 15 percent.
This is why it's so important to invest in language learning for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of the language they teach in.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create an educational environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of our country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, thus offering diversity and high competence to Scotland's youth.
It's not fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting time is almost upon fans who are eager to see LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he will play has not yet been decided.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has suggested that James will most likely play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule.
"I don't need a singing career at this stage to get ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stops next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With confirmation votes awaiting the election to fill the Supreme Court's vacant position, Trump has aimed to build up support for upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of the congress when votes are due in November.
How long will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely record this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about accusations of sexual abuse, with a predicted confirmation vote from the Senate on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this collection is to help the Republicans meet the November election and gain momentum.
So President Trump's campaign says that these five meetings next week are designed to uplift volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", a spokesman for the Trump campaign said, declining to be informed by Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening gathering will bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a lift in the opinion polls", said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows belly for struggle to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup-winner needed.
The swinging pendulum of moment is a completely invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we're taking it as a small moment, I guess", Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and leads by example.
The boys' screams of the fearing grew higher as his round continued, looking for an important putt to match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down by two.
His pitcher, who won the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks the American team isn't out of this.
"You've actually just got to dig deep and worry about your own fight", Spieh said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas these past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unconquerable history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird, but cute couples are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
The only couple not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon was Mollywood, who also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a 18-hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cement that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talking about European honor is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did brief work on Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the grovel spanjol and the swens in a hole they never came near to clatter out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch in close quarters because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome increase also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that anyone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's foursome and four-ball matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take his fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side had been ordered to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failing American side in morning fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States worshipped more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they could not recover the deficit.
Jim Fury's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named Molliwood after a spectacular weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four Ryder Cup history matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they gave themselves so greatly to beat a tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more desirable 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-ball and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to his teammates Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe still didn't get everything they wanted on a beautiful, blown-out day southwest of Paris.
Three-time big winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American reference with two points on Saturday.
They won a bold 2 & 1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes as they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit and entered a single, although as holders Fury's side only needs to sign to retain the trophy.
After being the next best for two days, it still looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside them.
North Korea says there's no point in rushing down unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, the misconfidence in the United States will increase and that the country would not give up its unilateral nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Government's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to better contain it in the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We're not getting anything back from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "fascally" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statements proved significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear demolition, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever held between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the development of nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wished for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
The United States insists on "developing nuclear power first" and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they oppose even the declaration to end peace, Ri said.
The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that as the sanctions continue, our mistrust only grows.
Ri did not mention the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: "The party to this push for nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, the demolition of the Korean Peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done".
Yet Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the US mainland, after the president of evil Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
Trump, who last year believed in the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still needed to be done and that sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and he said, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the attacks.
But the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without fail until we have the complete, final, verified elimination of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for bringing in gangster-like demands.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the United States made similar measures.
He said Kim had told him that the "equivalent" charges he sought were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture that focuses on studying caffeine all night long.
One academic found that top-level students often neglect the most basic of things - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, Why am I being told this now, in my old age?
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after students had received seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one episode, a picture of a sleeping room is shown, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of students at once.
But we think they have a right to know -- just as you have a right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride over the past still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough, good quality sleep should be your student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after being a student at Harvard his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised that students should assess the need to set an alarm for when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of light coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can transform the inner clock altogether, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga-goals give Gerrard's men a downturn
The Rangers went on a new defeat on the away field when Dolly Menga's entry sent Steven Gerrard's uncovered side to a 10 loss on Livingston.
Ibrox side were looking to take their first away victory since the 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side suffered only Gerrard's second defeat on 18 fights as leader, giving eight points, one round under Ladbrokes' Premier League leader, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger-opposition with lack of inspiration never seemed to match.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further problems on the Rangers' stock after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an object was apparently thrown from the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that led Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot a week earlier, and he would have been excited about the way his well-riddled dress took the kneecap of his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his fight.
A long frispark from Keaghan Jacobs was found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the returinn plant.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third round.
Alfredo Morellos knew he would have to face a 20 meter penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson vindicated the colombian's wishes.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but earlier Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about Lassana Coulibaly's headaches and a tamt shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules, no one can deny that they claimed it only because of the "shot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which he held cool to pull out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard paused as if he had replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change caused an immediate effect when the winger made a luke for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raced forward to block.
But Livingstone continued to override the guests to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending longshot on longshot.
Holt's team could have increased its lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in preventing Jacobs from doing so, until Lithgrow left a long post from the cornermark.
Ranger's reserve Glenn Middleton had a new claim to punishment when he supported Jacobs, but Thomson again overlooked it.
Almanakk: The inventor of the geigertellar
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECALL... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger-teller.
As a scientific bearer ever since, the Geiger-teller also became a bearer in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, featuring the seemingly unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that come from the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: Yeah, now it's bubbling!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to see red cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see red cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking out immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the lab.
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then they can clean it up.
One test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that the egg-stoke disease disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immunocells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can see a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then purify the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immunocytes from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after hosting the television show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was piped into the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised his U.S. president, Donald Trump, and said he would run for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a slap and reiterated his support for Trump.
So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, How could you like Trump, he's racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a number with comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood stars mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's tirade recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the entry.
West had also complained to the audience that he had difficult backstage due to his head plague.
He bullied me behind the scenes.
"Do not go out wearing that hat, " they said.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place, he said, according to the Washington Examinor.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken place?" He said he wanted to wear the Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments led to at least two public outpipes, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person speaking to the publication: "The entire studio was dead still".
West was recalled as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier-flaske.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "Til one of the most courageous spirits: THANK FOR OUT OF THE PEOPLE".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply as he is and that's absolutely amazing.
But I chose NOT to pay anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I believe embraces and expels an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He is free.
We've added to that too.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
As a co-producer, Snoop Dogg has been given the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last musical legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Tilted for attempted murder after knife-taking in Belfast-restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to meet in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be assessed by the prosecutor's office, the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is fighting against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often lead young boys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "quite strongly" to address the issue.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity".
What have we learned from men as they grow up, regarding the problem we see now?
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel they have to be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with the young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be doing Game of Thrones sequels or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "ready for battle" with his horses.
From November, Kit will play in a new play of Sam Shepards' True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is looking at his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that's how it gave me my future family and my life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the outcast of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says the health department.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is widely reported.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have shown that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of these diseases stem from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promoted universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add any information from GOP senators, it explodes in dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedalised by extreme-high-flying investigations and websites.
"Lying, lying and more abhorrent lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information was based on the home addresses and telephone numbers of the Americans, South Carolina's Sens. Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information, which was released on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a senate panel hearing on charges of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the input was linked to Waters' office and issued the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This groundless claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
One of my employees -- who has had his identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unfair and false claims -- was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Water's comments quickly received criticism on the web, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is held responsible for something they did not do, do not be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and peaceful.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the critics of judges Kavanaugh, who were blamed by critics for being apparently too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Too much if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the rightful authorities and the law-abiding entities of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continues, and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to each of my employees".
Johnny English hits back - spy by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit-worthy titles in all new films with a British angle, and it is valid for this revival of Johnny Englands action-comedie spoof-franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-deprecating satire about how openly miserable we are become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the large-sized, incompetent Johnny English with his rubber face has for the second time been forced to renew his life to fucke things up - his name more than anything else signals that he is a broad comic book creator for non-English speaking countries.
He is of course the stupid, secret agent who despite his bizarre wishes to spread some glamour has been given a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple melody to the Firewalls, the theme during the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
It is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard-TV advertisements, which left chaos in the aftermath.
There are one or two fine blinkers in this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval suit of armor while the rotor blade hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor is rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially since such serious films as 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's directed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident isn't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica-free outfit in the person in Bean.
The permanent current situation is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web of spies, who reveal the identities of all agents the UK has in the area, to the horror of the agent at work - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a pompous and war-eating prime minister who already has a complete breakdown in political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work with.
Her advisers inform her that once every single active spy has been convicted, she must recruit someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, because English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a necessity briefing and reconciliation with his earlier understandable assistant Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved to an underboat driver job, an over-enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a lost cause.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go horribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service is back in full swing in the encounter with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technological enchantment of the billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the formidable Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farcelike wild games: dressed as waiters, they set up a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's pleasure boat; and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality main set to make himself known to the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops are probably drawn out to the last sequence, but as lovely and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a lot of children's TV all over it.
Quite moderate things.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that they are working on a plan to make Englishmen work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five.
The party wants, according to the report, that business leaders send further savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, by giving them an extra day off.
Then employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would align with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy announcement is expected to be announced before the turn of the year.
'It does not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party's overarching industrial strategy.'
The Green Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as it had promised a four-day workweek in its 2017 election campaign.
The ambition is for the blink of an eye, however, not approved by the Labour party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not party politics and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used previous weeks' work conferences to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was firmly determined to take back power from "unsightly" directors and "profitable" companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water department cannot recover their entire efforts as a Labor government could make a move due to perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers into company governments and created Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of private sector enterprises' own capital to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500, or about 5,000 kroner.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV program 60 Minutes how the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has complicated a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of how the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said, "On my way to the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and the charge came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, and clear.
Graham's voice seems to be in stone, however.
"I've changed my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, added Graham, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all the people she names couldn't prove it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive lineup of performing stars and an equally impressive mission; to end the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather on the grand stage of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or volunteer work; send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of paying people for a free concert a real way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of the so-called "clicktivism" -- people feel they're making a real difference by signing an online appeal or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million works by its supporters, participating in and pressing on a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group issued 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds they have secured so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to helping children reach their full potential; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment a footnote in history", said The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman to the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that the UK improve nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
And in response to one of the most common questions on their website, they ask, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens answered: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performers at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as a blockade to block Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an incentive to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to consume energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy does not go to the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an idealistic group that presents itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel", he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The announcements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
In this context, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "North Stream 2 pipeline project", which Trump says turned Berlin into Moscow's "prison".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American holding has withdrawn back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will run hard to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take a "ground-breaking look" at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will consider running for president.
Warren took on President Donald Trump during the Council meeting and said he was "conducting this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been criticized by Trump and his supreme court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll published on Thursday showed, however, that the majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should stand as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-three percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round of earlier governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at the Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being hit by a mine in September.
He was arrested and charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm at his home on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other family members who are affected by PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers return with", she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrestation the elephant in the room and said about his son and other war veterans that they'd come back a little different, they'd come back here, they'd come back and wonder about the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other military, have done for the country, exists.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for disturbing a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while under house arrest, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-right card Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions fits the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and the violent gang member's sons abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The United States' advocates who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy reversed a 2014 immigration law law that allowed illegal immigrants who fled domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle", said a friend of the court briefly.
Advocates argued in the summary that policies that deny immigrants access hurt the U.S. economy, and said they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor".
General counsel Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of forced labor and forced prostitution in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It's very exciting", said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever-prone baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"A quarter of a minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.
Residents are observed on their way back to their desolate homes, searching through water-damaged property and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the earthquake's devastating 7,5-magnitude hospital was overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken their backs and shoulders, were resting outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to still strong tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he told me that he knew the powerful earthquake that had shaken the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think, and I told Harris to the Associated Press, and he told his family to be in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador blames China for "mobbing" with propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page ad in a US daily newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the American ambassador blamed China for using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid contributions to the Des Moines registry - Iowa's largest salsavicious state - after blaming China for trying to interfere in the US congressional floor on November 6, a debt China has denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election highlighted what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them increasing taxes on each other's imports.
China's early trade war tariffs were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and the longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary in Sunday's Des Moines-register, doubles the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In its propaganda campaign, the Chinese government uses America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper desk down the street here in Beijing, you'll find bounded voices that differ and you won't see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is under the steady thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had abrogated his article's "offer to publish", although he did not say what kind of newspaper.
Republicans are outraging women voters ahead of midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts warn.
Since many top Republicans are stand-by and defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple accusations of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will likely see a setback, particularly from women, in the upcoming mid-way elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move on with a vote.
These things cannot be regretted, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute pressures for an FBI investigation will be enough to anger angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior counselor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestants sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the Senate hall when the Republicans, who govern the court committee, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart", said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual abuse directed against nominated high-ranking officials, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed forward with the statement.
"This has become a confusing root for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, points to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be a little divided about who to believe in the aftermath of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more side effects with the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the high-ranking nominee showed her genitals while they attended a party at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology chain, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source code platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
'We have to do it now,' he said of the start.
It's a historic blink.
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own personal online data warehouse or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, house lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about this personal online store is that it's entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's managing director John Bruce, is to bring resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company consists of the eye-blinking Berners-Lee, Bruce, an insurance platform purchased by IBM and some contracted developers to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on overnight.
We don't care about their lives.
In a post on a medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet", says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine feast
The only English church divinity that won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior has been celebrated in its hometown 100 years afterwards.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be unearthed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 through a very thick wound and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns.
He later ran up to the front line, and with the greatest gallantry led the line forward before he alone rushed forward with a field gun and struck three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "I know I could never live up to, but something I am modestly proud of".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also left a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that the value of a real hero is shown by the support that is given by many people.
MMA fans were up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to watch a package Bellator 206 and you're not going to see the main event.
The San Jose account contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in Britain were again deafened when the coverings turned into Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake for the early hours of the game.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the children's cartoon series as "a kind of sick joke".
"It is public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the content was not proper, they would have to switch to the children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellators senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
The Peppa Pig, yeah.
Bellator's company president Scott Coker said they will work on planning to include British spectators in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can figure it out", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning, and we don't know this until Sunday our time, their time on Monday.
But we're working on it.
I believe that as it went on, there were many texts going back and forth, and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it for five matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we tried to survive to the fans, and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was known for his sexuality
Olympic stunner Tom Daley says that growing up he felt worse than anyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that everyone is like me.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular reporter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
What might have looked like a departure from Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt less than everyone else who grew up because it was socially unacceptable to resemble boys and girls.
He said, "From now on, feeling less than I know myself and feeling different, would be the real things that have given me strength and strength to be happy".
He wanted to prove that he was noko, he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a professional LGBT campaign and used his appeal at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live openly without prejudice and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference would never have been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age -- he went to his first Olympics at 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find anyone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, do everything I need to do to win a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
'I couldn't tell him that you weren't going to be in the front row,' he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home audience at an Olympic Games where fans have no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Prolt by Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.

Mickelson is out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must turn his shape to avoid an unfortunate milepell.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen on the bench by captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he often has been for the United States, the five-time grand winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within reach in the hope of correcting what plagues him.
Never the most competent longshot, and even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting the longshot on the demanding French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not accurate with the stroke.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson in the ninth game on Sunday will meet the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has fought alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's fight could be decisive.
Furious expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's a very self-confident man.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to those laws in the past and this week.
I didn't think he played two fights.
I saw more, but that's how it turned out, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-parties, although Furyk said his proximity added some immaterial qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's entertaining, he likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storage room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun hanging out with him this week, which was funny to watch.
He contributes much more than just playing.
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the final days of the Ryder Cup singles can easily be turned into an unpleasant tour.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama, where a side-captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the goal with the nose ahead with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far", said Bear, after seeing Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You're going to a full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're so aware of what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world.
Pleased with how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the winner by surprise.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual achievements that come out, and that's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too.
In contrast to Bjørn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the snooperations of the great last days, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe withdrew from the Mirakelet in Medinah.
"I remember every fucking word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players on his way into the last day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When that moment gets a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle struggles.
We set up our lineup corresponding and put the guys on a run that feels good, you know, we try to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the arrangement.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way through", Bjorn said of his choices of singles.
Germany's new warship delayed once more
The newest frigate of the German navy was to have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the cold war era, but it will not be there until at least the following year due to faulty systems and apparent costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been suspended for the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-Avis, citing a military spokesman.
The fleet was supposed to have joined the fleet in 2014, but the troubling problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered back in 2007 by the Sjøforsvaret were replaced by the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-skip missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from the home-plan ports.
Nevertheless, continuous overlapping means that the pioneering warships, which have allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will be outdated as they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125-fregatten made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important software and hardware errors that made the warship unusable if deployed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen-frigates.
It also proved that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces performance and limits the ability of the fleet to add to future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training the crew - is also a problem.
It's said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent observations that Germany's fleet is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually had almost completed its distribution of competent ships.
The officer said the problem had built on over time, because old ships were dismantled, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust reports on the mysterious life of the flagger mouse
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the flagger mice use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the find will shed new light on the unique approaches of the flying pathways and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton flaggermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important sites around the property to track flaggermus activities throughout the season.
NHS-based and volunteer staff will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recorded sounds will determine the frequency of the flagger calls and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's scientific advisor, hopes the results will reveal what areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important to the flagger mice and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the purchase of eggs and how best to maintain equal forest areas for flaggermus and other related species.
Flaggermus populations in Scotland and over the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are the belief in building and development work that affects resting places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flying papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Flagger mice are not actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flaggers very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, resting place inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flaggermus reserve on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flaggermus species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is their ideal territory.
"Here on Threave we have a great area for flagger mice", he said.
We have old buildings, many veterans trees and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about flagger mice that's still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasizes the importance of checking for flaggermus before carrying out maintenance within properties, since it is possible that the endless destruction of a single buplass could kill up to 400 female flaggermus and young people, and perhaps exterminate an entire local population.
Flaggermus are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, torment or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are endangered".
Ronaldo rejects violent crimes in the case of German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the violence he has committed as "false news" and says that people want to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and the Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, tells his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations, that the allegations are "false news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Golden Ball winner is in the camera.
They want to market themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They'd be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, let the player in and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers have filed a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions within the area of personal privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage" in an amount that is dependent on the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where one claims he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The majority claimed that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and claimed he was 99 percent a good guy and failed by one percent.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries at a hospital, but was later agreed to an exception because she felt "scared by the public outrage" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is trying to change accommodation as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in the summer he was transferred to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was om that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would meanwhile stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border crossings in case a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, it will close its Mini factory in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns concern concerns what car manufacturers say is the supply chain's risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions that the industry says could lead to overuse and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is nettopp calibrated to avoid border controls.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy today's success, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's daily programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but on a longer term basis they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite union's president of the plant, said that his members are more concerned with: "From my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be exacerbated again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy chief counsel Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back a week as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, Trump-assisted links to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will resign the general of the prosecutors or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to avoid kicking Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There's no date set. It could be this week, but I can and I imagine it'll be delayed another week because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.
Some reporters will probably say it unambiguously: Sanders hasn't held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of guidance was not due to a discontent with the TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said: "I'm not sure they do".
She also mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before", she said, "right enough without bringing evidence to the contrary.
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but as the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it this way, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated perhaps why, where he appeared before reporters without shame, and almost bizarrely.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fear among EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and a wish for their continued post-Brexit work.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applications that have the status of settlement for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations concerning the withdrawal of the UK from the EU have continued, and the expected conclusion is approaching in the autumn.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
So I'm going to repeat now how much I value the contribution of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, have valuable experience and expertise that reinforces and improves the work in the health sector and is beneficial to patients and society.
Scotland is your home, and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after a head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way", Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie the oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a bar and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman for Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie was completed operating at Vanderbilt medical centers.
There are no details about the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie is in her second year at the university, and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher documentation fee when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher documentation fee when they buy property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The deal will neutralize Corbyn's success by attracting young voters
The increase in the document tax will be added to non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher documentation fee when they buy property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young, high-income voters, with a promise to offer affordable housing.
The increase in document tax will be added to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of omissionaries.
The tax, which comes in addition to the current document tax, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on apartments number two and rental apartments, which can be as much as three percent.
The state budget expects the decision to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of new housing in London is bought by residents outside the UK, which makes prices higher, and it makes it harder for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many of the country's well-established areas - especially the capital - have become "spoken cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time reside in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the document tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by taking property but not using it, and asked Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's housing shortages.
Corbyn has announced a series of eye-opening proposals for housing reforms, including controlled leasing and the termination of evictions without cause.
He wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the devastated housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Yet it cannot be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign companies, to buy housing as it is for hardworking, British citizens.
For many people, the dream of a home is too far away, and the ambitions of being humble are real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland
Sunderland's chief executive, Jack Ross, says his ultimate ambition is to become a manager for Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) are currently in third place in League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-League, and that was it", Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland at the Hamden team up with my father, and there's always been something that's pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I have success as a club manager.
Ross's former Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, as he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For the moment, my success will be measured in whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they are home to the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only see myself as successful if I can get the club back there
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, following a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in training preparation for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa get from a third-level downfall, and transformed St Mirren, which was on its way to a downward downward spiral, into the title winners of the next season's championship series.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did when he was playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"There was probably a roadblock", he says, "to lead the whole way".
I genuinely thought that being a manager was much better for me than being a player.
It sounds weird, because I did it well, earned it well, and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still notice that when it comes to the stress and pressure of work, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've ever felt in my own body in my entire adult life.
On Sunday 30 September, you can hear the entire interview on Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Research shows that the perfect time for a half liter is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the income of struggling pubs in the UK, but also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased 2.7 percent in the kid's diet -- but for the restaurant industry, it fell 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business consultant Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The current sun, and the fact that England was involved in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June when pubs rose 2.8 percent, only that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food also noticed the sun's decline, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Between pubs and bars, the drinking sales had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had fallen by three percent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to salt in the outdoor industry.
It's no surprise that the restaurant industry will continue to suffer, and a fall in sales of 4.8 percent annually would be painful to get to the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators operating with food, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a much-anticipated respite.
The total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry's sales monitor for the British pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes results from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry's reference index.

Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile profile they point to their parents, and they have private profiles.
A mother who snubbed over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to rape me.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of the Athletes in the Scottish Freedom Party
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Freedom Party as non-administrative director of the board's annual general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated freedom fighter, and board leader Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected across Scotland, the UK and the world's civil rights community, and we're sure that the civil rights in Scotland can benefit from getting her into government", Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to be a voice for athletes, and I hope I can be there to help and support the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won gold in both the 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to follow a drip.
He tweeted, "Today is a month since I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could tell me if I would recover, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
Split opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising that compares mothers to milk pups
A breast pump company has split the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to milkweeds.
To mark what is described as the world's first still-going, on-set breast pump, the technology company Elvie released a small-scale advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a crowded cow lounge, to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails". And "If you don't notice, this isn't a crowded lounge, these are my dolls".
The quote goes on: Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies
The ad, which is posted on the company's Facebook page, has, however, created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it highlights the "craziness" of the dairy industry.
Velily bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that calves are relied upon only days after birth, one writes.
Elvie-breast pump is discreetly placed in a breast-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: Really traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?
Another added: "For a distant reality ad".
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she thought the song was "fastid".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was still a mother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a genius product, wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a morosome of advertising directed at mothers who pump (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not a commercial that boasts or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they've all danced with the discreet pump packed into their braces.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
Elvie-pumps are entirely quiet, have no pipes or tubes, and are discrete inside a breast-brain, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "Elvie-pump is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk products, we want to shine a light on breast pumps and the challenges associated with them, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring, in a sustained and recognizable way.
This isn't the first time Elvie-pump has created headlines.
During the fashion show in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children imprisoned has peaked despite monthly border crossings being relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration's strict policies make it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and taking in a child could threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of this increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be forced to submit fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Earlier this week, Matthew Albence of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office testified to Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of individuals who have sought to be sponsors of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their rolls from before.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue to pursue these people, Albence said.
According to the camp's statutes, new rules for the treatment of children have been introduced, requiring that some of them be brought to court before a month has passed, as opposed to earlier 60 days.
Many will participate via video conferences rather than at personal meetings, to get their case tried before an immigration court.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape restrictions, the camp staff say.
According to the report, these concerns are greater in large facilities such as Tornillo, where the size of the facility makes it more likely that children are not being treated properly.
They suggested that moving children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or to say hate to friends, could amplify the trauma that many already suffer from.
Syria is demanding that American, French and Turkish occupation forces withdraw instantly.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is now at war on the eighth year.
Moualem, who serves as vice-minister, said foreign forces were illegally operating on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be treated out of it.
"They must withdraw immediately and without precedent", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight a holy struggle until all Syrian territory had been cleansed for both terrorist groups and the lawful presence of foreigners.
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When it came to refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to return, and blamed some western countries for spreading irrational fear of the surroundings that had caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return", he said.
"They make policies out of what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
Diplomats from the United Nations say a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffersone in Idlib, the latest major insurgency, has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear time limits" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee comprising government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why is Trump going to win another term?
With that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the presidency ends prematurely due to scandals and state law.
It would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!
As of this writing, there is no sign that the viewers have given up.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has been at the top of cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is a fire that people are lured by, because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, former comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalls a tour in taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh", he replied, according to Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodwards' use of "deep-ground" sources for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 strut jacket of struts, and the implications of Stormy Daniels' horrific description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
Personally, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, daily director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the show that goes on with Trump's employees and daily quarrels (going into a fight with the NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're not going to be around anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was picking up CNN.
He did not manage to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crap shows before and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but they were right.

Money from the outside flows into the closest interim election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a rearrangement of the congressional districts that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
Recently, the Pittsburgh suburb was overrun by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was drawn up again after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has set in motion a campaign of funding for the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congress and the Republican Congress.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a near-conquering victory in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a narrow advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador based on support for China, but withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama where his party threw out Trump's leadership group.
The secretaries of state decided to bring back the US chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions about no longer recognizing Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in an interview earlier this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The federal penalties, which included cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials held a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administrators explained that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore stopped the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the relevance the administration is putting on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American missionaries returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who were united in discussing the internal considerations on the basis of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an incomprehensible analyst who worked closely with the administration and spoke highly under the pretext of anonymity.
Students of history
One awaits Robert Mueller's special advice report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now considerable evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller has turned his focus in the investigation to whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to plot attacks on our election.
If the Congress were to change its leaders, Trump would have to be right in this body, in that he is preparing to convince the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of "what" about it, and I don't mean to imply that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it for his counterpart in Europe.
It's a choice for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight can last.
In 1938 German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood in against him and helped the Munich Czechoslovak.
We failed, and missed the possibility of avoiding the age of bloodshed that this brought.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing many of these turning points now.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this newspaper revealed that he last year proposed to debrief the president, and speculated in whether he is unlikely for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we in the middle of the day vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I have my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to serve a Sabbath light on the table carrying the swastika.
Now, since this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna meeting
The Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the fight of believing we could get something, and came out with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is still going to be a big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight. They did a good job in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can keep going and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything is going well.
The stable is good and the boys are thriving; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, put the previous season behind us and succeed.
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension savings.
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be cared for, few talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey by insurance company Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation", says Nationwide vice president Holly Snyder.
Here you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wishes known and have a good time preparing.
Working with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a big part of setting costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The financing options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value life insurance to help pay for expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Make legal documents: Avoid legal battles before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so you can appoint a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can easily consider an authority for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the option yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your grandparents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What kind of medication is that?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.
Man shot several times with air guns in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun while on his way home from a trip to the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Politicians describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as an "incidental" act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to public officials.
Without the ability to communicate, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake, which had a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a region stretching over more than 300 km with coastline northwest of the island.
The region, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the western side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic age of the Pacific Ocean and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggering a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that swept through the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused devastation and panic when people were reminded of the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives, burning buildings that collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake hits the tourist island of Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists on the beach.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report released by the state police in Alaska, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involvement in reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison for life and is being held for $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded guilty to the charges when he was asked to surrender the network.
Palin faces three class A misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in prison and a fine of up to $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in veteran law in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in the home, involvement in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment of earthquake flourish on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal actors want a rare death penalty for suspected New York terrorists
Federal actors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway on lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
To justify a death penalty, the actors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims with intent and that he with intent inflicted serious, bodily harm on them, according to a note archived in the southern district of New York.
Both of these incidents may be the basis for a possible death sentence, the court documents state.
A federal jury submitted a list of 22 charges, including eight counts of murder with the purpose of money laundering, usually used by federal actors in connection with organized crime, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and deliberation", the actors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "disgraceful, cruel and pernicious".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused the loss of family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, it is noted.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the southern district of New York last sentenced a man to death in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two dople providers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed two years earlier for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of complaints in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was well known, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos from ISIS on the phone, it is said.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag on the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had earlier begged the actors not to go after death penalty.
Tory MP thinks Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the people's army today, during a protest at the Tory national meeting.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested he should lease the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, hard-line MP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain would have been out now if Farage was Brexit-minister.
With the challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister has struggled to keep the plan of the Chequers compromise on track after attacks by the Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allied forces insist that she press on to put in place an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash and forced the Euroskeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and the EU.
Bone told Leave Means Leave-grouping in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers.
He suggested that Farage should have been given noble rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had, we would be out now, he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We don't fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own promises in our own country.
Bone denies the claim that the public's opinion has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit fighter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, and she told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop Chequers and listen to me
In a message addressed to May, she adds: "Stats ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said politicians must get the warmth of their own will to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that me won't let them get away with it
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for their security problems with a party app during the opening of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to take a closer look at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take a closer look at running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city meeting in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is up for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a member of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's been the center of much speculation about whether she might try herself against Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke incident on Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters in a city hall since Trump's inauguration.
One participant asked if she had plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time that women take the trip to Washington to fix our devastated government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrestation made in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims was shot and killed Friday.
At 11 a.m. local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help identifying a man seen on the video clip.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday on the university's southern area.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In response, Simpson has admitted that he was on the scene, with weapons, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and placed in custody of the police department in eastern Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-meter, third-year student, raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games, 10 of them from the start of last season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching world title after team orders win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders came to play a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, and Hamilton let him defend his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to enter the depot and let Hamilton enter the traffic backst in the race, which should have been decisive.
Mercedesen drove into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after a bit of action side-by-side which made the Ferrari driver reluctantly have to let the inside be free in danger for not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and was seventh at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the race as he went for a quick finish with a goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase his pace during the last eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second, Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein on a Saturday election meeting on the grounds of her insistence that she not lack the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "slim and flawed and spoke falsehood".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and uncomfortable and speaking lies", he said.
When you look at publications and leaks and you say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't.
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, did you paint it?
Do you remember her answer? You're going to do the document -- oh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't like it.
Wait a second.
Let's... no, let's not, let's let him go, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leave her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
But her refusal didn't fit in with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
While he continued to defend the Hoge Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own gain.
They are determined to take back power in all ways they see necessary.
You see the badness, the fellowship, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to to get power and control, the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for the loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants were initially targeted by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled before Dwyer once again sent the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard outlived Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's boys, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, in which the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan's home team was back in the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt provided for Cownie's equation in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the break when he scored his second goal for the night on the tampon of the first leg.
The home game regrouped, and Bouchard once again provided an equation with a brilliant goal after 27 minutes of play.
Late in the second round, Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the match, and he, on his side, secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in their next game, which is on Friday.
Flygeleiers lose their lives to ensure hundreds of planes escape earthquakes
A Indonesian flyer is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to do to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers gets safely up in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swung wildly.
He was left to ensure that the aircraft on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it had collapsed.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Sadly, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking", he added.
In the Middle Ages, the authorities feared that the number of deaths would rise to thousands, while the country's crisis-control agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong's small towns was limited.
"The number of dead is increasing as we find bodies trapped under buildings, many of which we cannot reach", said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have devastated Palu, which is scheduled to host a mass grave on Sunday.
Naudhhelp is equipped with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A four-minute ambulance with multiple bodies is coming.
It's difficult to find clean water.
The small shops have been destroyed.
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross strives to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they appear.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the military in the country: "I urge you all to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok struck Indonesia, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini reports a missing man after a lagoon-fly crash
The airline operating an aircraft that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not give details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land on the airport on Chuuk Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been sent to hospitals.
The airline said six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Marines said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the roller coaster.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wash through the water, which took them to life, to the necessities of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew was panicking and screaming, and he sustained a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Marines said that nearby sailors, who worked to improve a quay, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' planes over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts make a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution filed all the evidence on Saturday during the ankle trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified in several classes as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he puzzled together recordings from cell phones to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the accused, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett reported that he used location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what Tellis had previously explained.
When the localisation data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' mobile at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police pulled out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was outside that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my car was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a moment after Chambers' death, she deleted Tellis' messages, conversations and Chambers' contact information from her cell phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will conclude the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio will challenge the music genre's negative reputation by filling their music with positive thoughts.
The High Generation of Bristol, England, says hip hop has moved away from the original political idea of dealing with problems in society.
They want to go back to hip hop's roots and make the proven version of the genre popular again.
The Fugees of Common have become more popular in the UK through the artists Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York's children's passports sue couples for firing after a "racistic" text message
A New York child passenger sued a couple for dismissal based on discrimination after she received a misspelled text message from her mother who complained that she was "a black person".
The couple has denied being racist, and compared the indictment to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that her adopted son, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, ENDA EIN SWART PERSON", Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to the nanny Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman fired her adoptive father Maurice, saying that the former adoptive father, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before being sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for firing her, and she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even though it was without a contract, where she was supposed to live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not right to do this", she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple has denied being racist, saying that giving Maurice the dismissal was the only thing they could do after having offended her, because they were afraid she would come to take revenge.
My wife had sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", said husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
But would you let someone you've offended take care of your children, even though you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.
Plasco compared the prosecution to "extortion" and said his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you really attack someone in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do", said investor Plasco.
While the case was going on, the publicity has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid people wouldn't like a talking bear, reveals a new letter
The author's daughter, Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the first book was approved, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's really funny to know now how successful Paddington became.
Jankel said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the tiny teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
As for Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of the family, she added that her father was deeply proud of how successful he was.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never quits", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having kids who achieved something: you're proud of them even though you're not really behind them.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it", said Ednan-Laperouse.
So Nad called to say that she was going to die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, I love you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there soon.
The medicines the doctors had given her for her heart to continue to pump were slowly on the way out of her system.
She was already dead and her body was about to be broken off.
I just sat there, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep everything in.
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything", she said.
I sat with my head bowed while the tears fell.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I realized how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hanging signs on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up tickets on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people thinking about suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on the tickets.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at age 18.
I don't want any parents to feel like I know myself every day.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smiling infection.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms.
But before he died, he stopped working, because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that my stepbrother may have been affected by Tyler's death".
Davis wrote the notebooks so people would know that there are other people out there who care and can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone. You need to talk to someone.
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything", she said.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that he was starting to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, but he didn't even look at them.
She told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We are completely devastated.
But we all have to fight to keep going.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking for, "a limited investigation, "then maybe we could achieve a little solitude", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee would collapse amid a partisan backstop.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're delaying because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are just five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do well, this will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called on senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to vote in the Senate, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, but with 50 votes, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the final vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean displaced persons decreased during Kim's rule.
The number of North Korean deputies to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of External Affairs, saying there were 1127 expatriates last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling taxes are the main reasons the number has fallen.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
Most North Korean refugees receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views displaced persons as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often sends them back with forced labor.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and sometimes cried with a lump in his throat as he talked about his family and his years of being away.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque" and a planned assassination of his reputation, organized by liberal politicians angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi made an objection when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this. "If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor the court he's serving now", Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal appeals court.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about potential Kavanaugh judgments against the law known as Obamacare and the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions in the high court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great", Pelosi said.
And women must swing their swords
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't help but cry.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high-ranking firm, who said she was angry, but developed a technique where she told the person who made her so angry that she was angry, "You might think I'm sorry because I cry.
I'm angry.
And then she just kept going.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears are a way to get out of your mind, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of an earlier job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I got angry, and a woman older than me grabbed me in the neck -- she was a cold leader that I had always been afraid of -- and took me out of the hallway.
'They never let you cry,' she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and that they won because they made you cry.
Patricia Schroeder, a congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught in disbelief on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough", she told me laughing, 30 years later.
Already seven other candidates were up for election, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Some called the situation "Snøkvit and the seven dwarfs".
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, she hadn't raised enough money, so she promised she would just shut up if she could raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporting actors who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she would not stand for election, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she broke up.
You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
What branch?
How the trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The opening salvoes of the US-China trade war were heartening, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
The U.S. President Donald Trump took the first shot this year by taxing important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on items worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken a stand and imposed tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer to the United States for every shot they fire, and the world's second-largest economy most likely won't go down with the first one.
To get Washington to stop, China has to do what the United States wants, but to bow to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the U.S. pressure can have a positive effect on China's economy in the long run, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could cause both economies to collapse is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before", said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who want to return voluntarily, and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's security situation was progressing.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks be to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All provisions are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel from terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond the daily life and bread of life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to take in help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept assistance or help with terms from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe secures victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in the team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, who reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who missed most of the tournament, hit the ball in the water from the tee-en at hole 16, par 3, thus giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players to have won 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, was 2nd and 1st behind Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has competed in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European with 25.5 career points.
I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help, said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He then handed the staffing pin to the countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I know an enormous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup throughout his career.
A curious statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairground throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, testified after a deceptive performance by his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There were periods this morning when we were making Europe hot.
We fought.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a remarkable captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
One has to take off one's hat.
We were rounded.
Updating dinoflagellate: The concentration is reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in the concentration of dinoflagellate in the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, there are reports of unfavorable growth conditions in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and the surrounding Collier counties - all of which suggest a reduction in concentration.
A growth of dinoflagellate extends over approximately 200 km along the coastline from northern Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Areas of dinoflagellate are located approximately 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough, but compared to the previous week, there are fewer areas.
Dinoflagellate has been observed in Pasco and has been observed in the past.
There have been reports of medium-sized concentrations in Pinellas over the past week, low to high concentrations along the coast in Hillsborough, low concentrations in Manatee, high concentrations along the coast in Sarasota, medium-sized concentrations in Charlotte, high concentrations in Lee and low concentrations in Collier.
Irritation in the airways is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Irritation in the airways was not reported northwest in Florida last week.
