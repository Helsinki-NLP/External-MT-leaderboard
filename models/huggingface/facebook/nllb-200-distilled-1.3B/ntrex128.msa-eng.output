Member of the Welsh Assembly (AM) worried about 'looking like a puppet'
There was concern among some AMs over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament for Wales).
It arose because of plans to change the name of the conference to the Welsh Parliament.
I'm worried across the political spectrum it could invite scorn.
A Labour MP said his party cared about it rhymed with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means crazy and pwp means dirty.
The AM from Plaid said his party as a whole was "not happy" and had proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open minded" about the name change, but stated it was a short verbal leap from MWP to Puppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is said to be the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Council Commission, which was drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any matter referred to as a Council Member must be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission informed the public of the outcome of the public consultation on the widely supported proposal to call the council the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the AM title, the Commission is favoured by the Members of Parliament for Wales or WMP, but the MWP option receives the most support in public consultation.
The AM appeared to propose an alternative option, but had trouble reaching a word of agreement and could upset the head of the Honorary Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the change in a matter of weeks.
The law on reforms included other changes to the way councils function, including rules on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will get the final vote on what to call it when they discuss the bill.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was established in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly denied its membership offers to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO union.
St. Martin's bell is silent as churches struggle in Harlem.
"The old man I met said, historically, there were bars and churches on every street corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, both are gone".
He said losing the bar was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now", he says.
"The bar is no longer the living room in the neighborhood where people go all the time".
For the church, he worries the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they'll be back where they started".
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the sacred sites that still exist in this neighborhood.
"The majority of people who would buy condos in these buildings are white", he said, "and therefore would have these churches closed down altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these condos will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved in in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by blacks under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping thoroughfare in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks in employment.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the Reverend Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the bell tower.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's, proudly referred to the tower bell as the "poor man's bell".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been playing out at St Martin's over the past few months has been a nuisance to architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The Vestry - the governing body of the congregation, which is made up of civic leaders - wrote to the bishop in July with the concern that the bishop "will endeavour to approve the cost" for the vestry, even though the vestry was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while diving for shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for shrimp in California on the opening day of shrimp season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream to catch shrimp, but he realized the boy was screaming, "I've got to bite!"
I got bitten!
The entire skeleton of his spleen was torn open, Hammel said he noticed when he got the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that sharks were spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it has been determined that they are a harmless species.
Giles added the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper body.
Officers closed off beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams from the beauty salon in a department store run by expert maids.
As part of a concerted effort to enter the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home furnishings sales return, a larger beauty space will be tested in 11 stores across the country and brought to more stores next year if it is successful.
Investment in beauty emerged as supermarkets sought ways to use shelf space once claimed for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded sections as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched a range of boutique make-up products to make the majority of its products vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand among younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test the concessions at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week while the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying a small amount of food daily at local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to work even harder to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the store would look like a convenience store as the supermarket chain tries to compete with big business Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several locations since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have boosted retail sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket previously wanted to change the beauty and pharmaceutical departments that ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boot in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to divide the revenue from the pharmacy in its supermarket.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the plan, adding a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty parlour to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in partners who are specially trained to be willing to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and our attractive surroundings and convenient location mean we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones is a bear after Holly Willoughby pulled an offer of £11 million.
Peter Jones, the Dragons' Den star, is 'beware' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled an £11 million deal with lifestyle brands to focus on her new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly brand housewares and accessories.
The couple's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host took to Instagram to announce that she was quitting.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a rage by withdrawing from the profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her extraordinary new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "overwhelmed" when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote to household goods and accessories from the Truly brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "All this time, Truly has been Holly's priority.
It's going to be his long-term future that can watch him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull everyone involved was completely unexpected.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff at Marlow's headquarters ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among the most bankable stars in Britain, could cost the firm millions due to massive investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares, and potentially delay its launch.
And it could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three and husband to Dan Baldwin had been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned a 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV production firm.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's lawyer on I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
'Conversation was firm and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism that the news media would receive for making comments that some would consider "inappropriate to the president" and extremely positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so willing to give up?
Trump said with a nod to the voice of the "news reader".
"I never give up".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was heralded by Trump as a major step toward halting North Korea's nuclear program.
But the negotiations to end the nuclear program were delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States on North Korea's initial ceasefire move.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued the sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We have good relations with North Korea", he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now we have a great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing back the remains of former American soldiers to their homeland.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs told them they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, a condition for international aid to be granted.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly don't ask for international help, so it's quite challenging", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is working together in a team to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the scene.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the frequent earthquakes Indonesia faces, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastal areas.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though the warning has been in effect, seems to contribute to the loss of life.
In the best of times, travel between the islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made dire infrastructure improvements a high priority in his election campaign, and he has made high allocations on roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has plagued Jokowi's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious understanding.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using axes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 minutes from Chelsea's goal with his side leading 1-0.
He kicks the ball to the left before kicking it into the away net.
The try soared high above the goal as it drifted towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball fell on Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get in that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I try to stretch as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a shot and didn't think long and then made a shot on".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before swinging in midfield and running into Liverpool's centre.
Kovacic gives and takes a quick pass in the middle.
He then delivered a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into the goal.
Hazard passed the defence and scored away with a left-footed pass from Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera footage to contact us as they may have information important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found is a local from Birkenhead and she was found inside her home.
In the evening, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police say an investigation is underway, they're in the process of notifying the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was so upset when he found out what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation would take hours before they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appears at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying it's so horrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van was outside.
Several officers stand in the cordon guarding the block of flats.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 from September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell Parliament is the latest reminder of the 'history of rewriting'
Its abolition would be poetic justice for the destruction of its Taliban with so much artifact of English culture and religion perpetrated by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither directed nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwell is a 19th-century testament and part of a historical figure many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the parliamentary defender of external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the next development of our country, and Cromwell was a man known as a figure who represented a divided section.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and commemorated".
Pig beats Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his family name "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a piggy door open.
He said inside the pigsty was a big male pig with a bloody mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had beaten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"his family", Wu said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the store at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not always aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just messing around.
They're nipper, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay with the right amount of respect,'' he said
Excess of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rainfall to the southwestern US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves into the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain in northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward toward the U.S. West Coast As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to push the tropics northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacts with the approaching trough creating heavy rainfall in the southwest the next day.
Inland, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more from Arizona.
Flash flooding may be in severe condition due to tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to venture into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to terrorise rivers and thunderstorms that will bring the country high winds and dust blowing.
The approaching trough will bring heavy rain to the Southern California coast.
A rainfall of more than half an inch is likely to occur, which can cause small debris flows and slippery roads.
This is the first rainfall in the region in the dry season.
Some tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rains become more pronounced late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October you can see some intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics stay a little warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a great example of temperature differences across the center of the US on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the warmth of the prolonged summer will try to build and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched a stunning testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute touch Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain Kavanaugh was groping her and trying to unbutton her shirt at the high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said it was 100% certain that it didn't happen.
It was probably over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures are not immediately available for other networks showing PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, that's the size of an audience equivalent to a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which the hosts argue has supported Kavanaugh's appointment, leads all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the lead character in this Friday's drama.
After moderate Republican officials issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught as CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning shouted at by protesters as he tried to ride the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes impaired for several minutes as he preached, live on CNN.
"I stand here before you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when most women don't".
Flake said that his office has issued a statement and said, before the elevator closes, he will have a lot to say at the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasts all covered the live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he'd only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look into charges against the namesake next week, the Democratic minority urged.
Flake is confident in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators after that, Flake made a decision.
This Flake choice is powerful, because it's clear the Republicans won't have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and compromising the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson stressed his attack on the so-called Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and EU proposals should collect tariffs on each other "completely absurd".
Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to Wayde's physical shooting.
The bond has been set at $350,000, Attorney General reports.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a report early Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police's hunting team, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police and local residents in assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "persistence and efforts for justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano into the southern area of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and it registered 183 gas and dust emissions over 24 hours.
This center monitors a variety of tremors and earthquakes.
Images on social media show a thin layer of car windshields covering a layer of ash in residential areas of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan sympathizers ahead of independence anniversary vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarized Catalonia election.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police threw eggs at them and released paint powder, creating a dark cloud on the roads that are frequented by tourists.
Fighting also took place later with police using their batons to fight.
Hours later pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in the face of unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but welcomed by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overall to be independent, although voter turnout was low with those opposed to secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop elections from taking place at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out last Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went on but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I see my parents crying with joy because they can vote but now we are stuck", she said.
While management is crucial if it is to come close to winning regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with prominent leaders many of whom are either in exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Competing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: man arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings says the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
Cross-Arch A may have also fired on the car at some point.
Menga's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston's rise surprised Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be a disaster as Gary Holt's team moved into second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts champions, whom they will be trailing by eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends his unbeaten run in this division to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling defeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opposition
Holt's team should have been way ahead before they scored, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his pass attempt, however Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his attempt after a slump to Craig Halkett's stump.
The hosts were eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they could give the opponents a problem with the set cut.
And that's how the important goals are.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set up Menga, who took the touchdown and goal net from the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had taken possession but found the home defense unable to penetrate goalie Liam Kelly largely unproblematic,
The pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a save for Kelly.
Scott Pittman was sent off by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses continued to get into Livingston's box and continued to clear, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for a handball - bounced away.
'Phenomena' from Livingston - an analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A remarkable performance and a result for Livingston.
For the men, they're very brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but a huge amount of credit has had to go to Holt for him running the team since he arrived.
He has many heroes.
Captain Halkett was extremely brave, creating a great organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on all fours.
The Rangers lack inspiration, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall far short of that standard.
The last ball was rather short - only once they cut the home team- and it was a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves at the middle table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The war protests depict the part of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some Turks and dismissed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Road, about a mile from the accident Saturday.
Metropolitan Police say officers are working to identify the man and notify his heirs.
Road closures and bus ramps are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disturbance
Six prison officers were injured in a disturbance at a high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist officers of the "Tornado" have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight occupants and has one wing.
Officer was treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring the police and can spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding.
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what could happen next week as Hurricane Rosa's wind energy tracks cross the Southwest Desert, risking flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a course over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night in heavy rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones remained storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models forecast 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated totals up to 6 inches deep in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals up to possibly 4 inches.
For those at risk of flash flooding, the pink rain may be a blessing since the region has been plagued by drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, some say rainfall will benefit since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the worst drought, the second highest category", reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the mainland of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm faces cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generates downpour.
So it's expected to collapse in Mexico at tropical storm strength in the afternoon or afternoon on Monday.
Rainfall across Mexico could be heavy, causing a risk of major flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, up to possibly 10 inches", weather.com reports.
Rosa will trail northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will traverse through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or debris is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with injuries in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Officers appeal to anyone who may have a cell phone record of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "suffering, meaningless, angry" Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the ruthless and excessive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered a very severe, angry" Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her during a decade-long teenage run.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of the Republican nomination in the general election.
"In five weeks, one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn't run, but I really ran", she said.
"That's why I'm in the place of fighting for a great candidate".
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, the senior GOP aide's leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds are killed in Indonesia's earthquake, tsunami, with toll figures rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that hit the coast, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave hit the land at dusk, sweeping away many deaths and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing beach activities and not running and they ended up being victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster response agency said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the edge.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and to be safe, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Paluu.
Aerial images released by disaster agencies show many destroyed buildings and shops, a twisting and collapsing bridge and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
Several aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Research and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 others were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and destruction may have been more severe along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu in an area called Donggala.
Communication was completely cut off without any information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Approximately 300,000 residents live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy but it could be worse", the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu even though officials said it had occurred within the warning period.
In an amateur video that went viral on social media, the voice of a man on the roof of a building was heard shouting at people on the street about the tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave swept up the coast and swept away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power leak that cut communications around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid by cargo plane from Jakarta and other cities but evacuated residents are still in need of food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala had arrived safely in Palu city, they were passing through the disaster scene.
 They told me that they saw many destroyed houses, he said.
It's very bad.
Although relief teams began disaster relief in a bleak environment, some said experienced foreign aid workers were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply of essential materials and the transfer of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says OK, this is a national disaster, then we can get help from abroad but for now no status.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu comes to a close, friends and families of the missing hope that their loved ones will be miraculously resurrected and cheered up instead of grieving.
On Saturday, a boy was found in a barn.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued the victim of a woman trapped under a rock rubble for two days with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national figure skating team has been training two paragliders who were missing from the earthquake for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi said.
"As a senior in figure skating, I have my own emotional burden", she said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how he eagerly sent WhatsApp messages to surfers in Palu who were attending a beach festival hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the surfing community.
The message sent has only one grey dash as opposed to two blue dashes.
I don't think the message got through, he said.
Thieves robbed $26,750 during a refill at an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink employees who were charging at the Newport on the Levee ATM last Friday, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The Brink employee emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's employee was busy doing his job, a man ran up behind him and stole a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene based on the report, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding the thieves should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: This person is officially known as Kanye West.
Kanye West, 41, was briefly known as Ye and he used that nickname as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change came during her appearance on the show Saturday Night Live where she was expected to release her latest album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance on the show due to "emotional issues", the show's creator said.
Previously, Kanye West said that the name had religious significance and was also an abbreviation for his current professional name.
"I believe ye is a common word found in the Bible and it means you", Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, we are us.
It's gone from Kanye, which means one thing, to Ye -- a reflection of the good, the bad and the bad and everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true selves.
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former Kanye West collaborator Jay-Z can also receive it with or without hyphens and capital letters.
President of Mexico, AMLO vows not to use military action against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to refrain from military action against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student retaliation.
AMLO pledged in Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to "never use the military to contain the Mexicans".
The military fired on civilians who were peacefully demonstrating in the plaza on October 2, 1968 which had caused 300 civilian deaths as left-wing student movements began to crop up across Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support the youth of Mexico by providing monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to get involved in criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
"The United States should double its funding in artificial intelligence as China becomes more active in the field", said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was expressed after the United States government made an announcement about artificial intelligence despite the United States itself as a whole lacking a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year with the goal of becoming the number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the amount of money spent on AI research is a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to make the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling up the funding could increase the chances of the next big achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States", Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player while a student at Carnegie Mellon University.
Lee recognized past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robot Challenge and wanted to know when the next competition would be held so that he could identify new talent.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government aid", Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders but corporate ones", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting great talent from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changing immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions. It is similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funding to U.S. researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center which aims to bring together partners from industry and academia.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US bill that attempts to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been seen as being stalled for months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Macedonians held a referendum on Sunday to decide on a name change to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece in which Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece has its own province named Macedonia, which insists that the name Macedonia represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name change in June but the nationalist opposition said the change belittled Macedonia's ethnic identity whose majority population is Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the vote and the preliminary vote raised doubts whether the vote would reach the minimum 50 percent vote required for it to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper reads: Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said accepting the new name was a price worth paying for joining the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means our lives are safer", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, lawmakers say they will abide by the vote's decision to make it final.
A name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The country's election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the parliamentary election in 2016 after 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast ballots in Macedonia for a name change that would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of a tent set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join with pride and not through this", Kavadarkov said.
We are poor citizens of a country but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will accept because more than 80 percent of our population voted for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "yes" vote was a "confirmation of our future".
A poll was published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies which said between 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - below the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a vote to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the vote would be seen as the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City navigates through the entire Brighton defensive line to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent off as Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very comfortable on his net in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker receives a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He raced through three defenses of Brighton, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He pushed a defender before chasing a few more men to the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushes the pass to the left, looking for Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that time".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball inside the Brighton area at the game.
He made a beautiful pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane takes a few touches before leading Sterling into the away position.
Sky Blues forward kicks the ball into the net before sliding out of bounds.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies for free.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the Citadel on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications of a run-off for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies embraced at least a special opportunity spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still look to lock up their first division champion.
"Even though we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams will play probably at the highest level I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to make a goal in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, will have a warm-up session on Thursday and will make a comeback on his usual day off on Sunday.
The right-handed reliever from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court's selection of Brett Kavanaugh while speaking of the importance of the Republican majority coming in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
I am not a contender but I am very competitive and that is why I am everywhere fighting for a great candidate, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this bad radical Democratic group, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, even if you see cruelty, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to violate to get power and control.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "defeat and block".
"And you've seen that for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil and untrue".
He referred to Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one -- that's the worst body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a large church.
It's not tolerant of anyone expressing their views.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to denounce me, it didn't work.
After all, I'm the latest in the line of AP Labor to be told we're not welcome - all for voicing our views.
My congresswoman Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because she supported anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interests of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, which ironically is almost the same issue that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notice of the meeting for Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want an inclusive and productive meeting".
In my nearly eight years as local AP Labor, the GC meeting on Friday night really encompasses all of that.
Sadly today, it's not the tone for many political meetings and promises of "better, softer" that have long been forgotten if, indeed, they ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are unacceptable in the Labour Party and that every opinion will be judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a previous colleague, I think sharing the same political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take a position that I would not agree with - whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak out - and no matter what I say - it's followed by criticism for abuse on social media, being told not to vote, criticizing the political centre, telling me to quit the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues because the comments on me are more political.
I was impressed by the professionalism and perseverance of my colleagues who were showered with sexist and racist slurs every day but never gave up.
One of the frustrating aspects of politics in this era is how the rate of abuse has become habitual.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that Labour should foster cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church and with every "no-belief" motion or change in election rules, the party gets narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years urging me to keep quiet, not stand out and then I'll be okay.
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, spurred on by the Thatcher government's neglect of my entire classroom, I have tried to lead better public service for those most in need - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never been a political secretary, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can possibly be mistaken about my position and the part of the conflict with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the feeling of wasting time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats of non-election or political conformity will not stop me from acting in what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: the matchless Ayr climbing to the top
Two slow attempts may have made the final decision lopsided, but there is no doubt Ayr deserves to win this exciting and entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, the only one never to lose to 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, how much they took chances, which made the home team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We have tested our game so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Thanks to Ayr, they take chances better than we do".
Grant Anderson scored a try in the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, was removed for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make a touchdown and Jason Baggot to capture an unconverted try.
Climo led Ayr on penalties, before, at half-time, he scored a point then a solo conversion attempt to make it 17-5 to Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out, and from the start Ayr went forward again through Stafford McDowall's trial, converted by Climo.
Sub-captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose retaliated with the extra player's unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a time of intense pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a no-ball Climo tackle, from the outside of the penalty area, MacPherson was hit from behind by Ayr's forward.
Climo converts, as he does almost as if starting again, after Kyle Rowe picks up a box kick from David Armstrong and sends away flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try.
The star of Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is seen to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and starred in alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series is the last in the show, and it appears Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to official records, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the thriving restaurant business.
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the Pacific route
The Marine Corps headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings fly the blue flag of the sea.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: 'The ocean is truly ours.
To get it back is a responsibility".
Across Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of losing a coast to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still vivid - like a longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hopes are perhaps the highest of the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of solidarity and calm, and of course hopes for a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will uphold Bolivia's claim that - after centuries of debate - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native Bolivian president - who faces a controversial run for re-election next year - also has a lot of stake in Monday's result.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and if it does happen little will change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to award territory to Chile, and has determined that it will not decide the outcome of any possible talks.
The ICJ's decision, which comes just six months after the final argument was heard, shows the case is "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, Chilean international law expert.
And not to delay Bolivia's policy any further, for the past four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the Bolivian administration now", Zárate said.
Morales' hostile rhetoric has diminished Chile's little compassion, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile at one point will continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to have a conversation afterwards.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions are usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of strife for the common good", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - used the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to a direct access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we must forget the past".
North Korea says a nuclear ceasefire won't happen unless it trusts the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not have a nuclear ceasefire first if it didn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during the summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to want to restart nuclear diplomacy that stalled more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "just a dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang first making a major ceasefire.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about launching weapons seen as the only way to ensure its national security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a huge headdress on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your hat collection or block out the sunlight completely, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a wide range of oversized weird headdresses for their SS19 collection on the show stage that personified the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hats have been sweeping Instagram this summer and these designers have been sending their personal designs to the stage.
A standout design by Valentino is a large water-yellow hat decorated with thick artificial fur that covers the model's head.
Other large-sized accessories include jewel-encrusted headbands, smart hats and even pineapples - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a strange mask selection - and the perfect time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had been sewn to his lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than elegant clothing.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with a snorkel and a googly, while the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the big fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Fashion observers predict that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
The oversized hat is warm from 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide straw hat has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label king behind the highly impractical hat has been touted on social media sending another big design to the show stage - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model covering the bathing suit she wears.
A flaming orange raffia bag, decorated with ribbed raffia and complemented with a white leather handle, featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I expect to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main streets for next summer - as designers have made a huge impact and it's hard to let the demand for large-sized accessories go.
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens.
Scottish private schools maintain a record of performance for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, bolstered by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strives to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector can and does implement the early school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming popular and optional subjects becoming required in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will go to his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest pass rates in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received A or higher.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students scored higher A's in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also scored A's.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as electives, are being held up as STEM subjects in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies, 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
This is why, time and again, language skills are becoming a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are crucial in this globalized world.
Whatever one's chosen career, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having this lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will automatically put a person who is multilingual ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French as the conversational language used by only two-digit percentages, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will teach languages seen as crucial for the UK as it looks ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there are often many languages to choose from in private schools, with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing learning environments that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of a country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire. It is the right thing to do.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron will make his first Lakers appearance on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is not yet determined.
"It's going to be over one and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell has hinted that James may be playing in limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career", he said.
Time of the Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a rushed rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote held for his pick to fill a vacancy on the Federal Court, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how did you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to handle this week's trial of Federal Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become strained over sexual misconduct allegations with the confirmation of a Senate vote that is expected to hold him for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this rushed rally is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign says the five rallies in the coming week are aimed at "empowering volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will be going to as many of our states as possible heading into a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday would be the second time in the past month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is following him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to his support", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows courage to fight to keep hope alive heading into Sunday's singles match
After three close games, Saturday night's corner is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time.
Swing momentum is a concept in sports that is a creation but it's really believed by players, and even more so in competitions like this.
So where do you think that momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's a four-point lead, so we brought a little bit of momentum, I guess", Jordan Spieth said as he walked out at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, four points ahead with 12 to go.
The American players, as Spieth put it, felt they had a little bit of an edge and a sense of encouragement, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each having three out of four points.
Spieth exhibited a toxic game from start to green and set an example to other players.
A cheerful cheer grew louder as he continued to march, making a crucial slide to match four points when he and Thomas were behind by two points.
His slide shot that gave them the win on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheers, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all these players have right now.
18 holes to show off the power.
The only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup records.
This pair of different players, this charming European character, but they're all four points clear and they don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that doesn't do a bogey on Saturday night, but they also avoid a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
The duration and the way their energy was given and shown by the supporters was proof they were the players to beat on Sunday, and no player was more popular to block the possibility of a European win during the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best they're both in separate holes.
However, the talk of a European team victory is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it easier for Sergio Garcia, the four-player hero this morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogie and two doubles on the first nine holes knocked out the Spaniard and the Swede.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch up close because of the interaction between the partners, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe have been playing better as a team so far and are far ahead on the final day but this four-session also shows the US team has a courage that was previously questioned by many, including local fans.
Team Europe leads 10-6 heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe brought a comfortable lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming off a four-ball and four-player match with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Two great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who is struggling to bring his victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn is trying to retain the trophy it captured at Hazeltine two years ago, overcoming the magical American team in the morning session of four balls, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. team provided more competition in the four-player game, winning two games, but failing to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 in Sunday's singles match to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive points during his and Molinari's stint, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend was the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and new American player Bryson Dechambeau in a 5&4 game.
Woods, who went through two tough games on Saturday, showed excellence but has now lost in 19 of 29 four-ball and four-player games and in seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during the morning four-ball session, returned to match Henrik Stenson in the four-man match to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - ranked number one and three in the world.
Europe is not so lucky on a quiet, relaxing day in southwest Paris.
Three-time major champions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 match in a four-player game lost on the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team trailing by four points advanced to the singles match, although as defending champions the Furyk team only needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of second place, Sunday's counterattack seemed out of reach.
North Korea says it's unlikely they'll disarm voluntarily without a vote of confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had led to their deep distrust of the United States and it was unlikely his country would voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important positive steps" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing nuclear test sites and pledging not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, there is no way we will disarm in the first place".
While Ri rebuked North Korea for Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps gradually, the fact seems important because it does not reject voluntary denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump gave assurances for North Korea's security.
North Korea sought to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow the recommendation to loosen international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on 'end first' and increases the pressure level in the sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposes 'declaration of end of war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that restrictions can weaken us is the empty dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are only exacerbating our distrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the US leader during a United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister cited only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the parties to this disarmament issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not find a deadlock".
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when she told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at a United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps to disarm, but said much work still needed to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we feel a complete, final and verified nuclear cessation".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program financing.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would then visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go smoothly.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to have condemned him for making "gangster-like claims".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to reveal missile sites and even nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "same measures" that Kim was seeking were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and were heading towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all its students more sleep in an effort to combat the increasingly caffeinated 'all night' culture of study.
One faculty member found that students at the world's number one university often fail to understand the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided a course that he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said: Why am I only being told about this now, in my senior year?
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to support academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students were sleep deprived throughout the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive tasks.
In one section, there's an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons, then encouraging participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", adds Prof. Czeisler.
A proud culture of 'stay up all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough quality sleep, he says, should be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety - even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler suggests that students should consider using alarm clocks before and even after bedtime, and be aware of the dangerous effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: goal to defeat Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another home defeat when Dolly Menga's net tied Steven Gerrard's weakened side with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were still looking for their first home win since the February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side handed Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as manager to cause his side to fall eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
The blow came in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers seemed to have no idea how to even the score.
With the Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and was just behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
And the Rangers may face another problem after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after being thrown by an object from his team's area.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in his side that reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after beating Ayr.
Holt has retained the same team as Livi 11 who stole a point from Hearts last week and he is certainly happy with the way his team's play has been worrying their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the game but Livingston made more attempts on goal.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed.
Keaghan Jacobs' free kick from behind found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pass the ball behind goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it was all hope in the last 30 minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty kick in the 45th minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to give up just two accurate tries in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily deflected Lassana Coulibaly's stumps and Ovie Ejaria's weak kicks.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the rhythm of the game, no one could deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to match Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was just stiff when Declan Gallagher slipped the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the switch during halftime by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost made an immediate impact when the winger passed the ball to Morelos but the impressive Kelly came out of his corner to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing team to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending away pass after pass.
Holt's side should have widened the gap in the final quarters but McGregor defended well to deny Jacobs before a Lithgow stump missed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton called for another penalty kick as he collided with Jacobs but once again Thomson ignored him.
Calendar: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, the page from our Sunday Morning Calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a major foundation of science ever since, the Geiger counter has become a backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the atomic effect of radioactivity in minerals".
Yes, it does now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that bears his name endures.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot malignant cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involved is to extract immune cells from the patient, change them in the lab.
It can see a protein that's common to many cancer cells and then inject it back in.
The trial vaccine showed encouraging results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, recovered from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the lab so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back in.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine".
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating some types of leukemia.
Kanye West attends a pro-Trump lecture, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It's not well received
Kanye West was mocked in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night titled Ghost Town in which she wore a Make America Great hat, she continued to oppose Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I ask white people a lot of times and they say, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'"
Look, if I'm worried about racism, I moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star examined Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Kanye West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with the shipment.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had difficulty backstage about his hat.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They're bullying me!
Then they say, I'm in a place that doesn't matter", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added, "You want to see that unimportant position?" saying that he's going to wear my Superman coat, because that means you can't lead me.
Try love"
His comments prompted at least two times of ridicule from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio went silent".
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with his performance of I Love It, dressed as Bottle Perrier.
West was backed by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who sent a message: "To one of the bravest men: Thank you for your criticism".
But speaking to talk show host Karen Hunter, West said she was just "being herself and that was great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe embraces and shares an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's out of here.
We too", he added.
Prior to the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now known as "the man formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the song refers to the music legend, Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and later also as the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in a stabbing incident at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is sucking on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has brushed off stereotypes of macho heroes, saying his on-screen character played means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes 'something is wrong' and questions how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt "very strongly" about dealing with the issue.
'I feel rather strongly personally, at the moment - where are we wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up, in terms of the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: 'What is nature and what is teaching?
What is it they teach on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they have to be men like this?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because there's clearly something wrong with young men today.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be starring in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ended next summer, saying he was "done with the battlefield and the horses".
In November, Kit will star in the film remake of True West by Sam Shepard which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed he considers meeting his wife, Rose, the best thing that ever happened on Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, so by doing so, it gave me a future family and my life started from here,' he said.
Rose portrayed Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow played by Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, signaling a change from previously.
Typically, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be on the rise.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of disease is due to inadequate sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked data on Republican senators, exposing 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations by a staff member who had displayed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted the claim was spread by "ultra-right wing" members and websites.
"Fraud, fraud and more bad fraud", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included the home address and phone numbers for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, posted by unidentified persons on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses that identified the source of the shipments that were associated with Waters' office and circulated information on Waters' staff, Hill said.
"These baseless accusations are false and a lie", Waters said again.
"My staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised by these false allegations - are completely unrelated to this leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false and in the form of lies".
Waters' statement prompted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is of a furious nature", wrote Fleischer.
"It shows he has no congressional qualifications.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't get angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motive of the accuser.
They must feel calm".
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction and Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he said, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions that could be destructive and harmful to any and all of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - a hoax by weak-willed Rowan Atkinson
It is common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of the action-comedy spoof franchise Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this a joke about how badly we're becoming a new export opportunity for the country?
However, Johnny English's eye-popping and bored face had the opportunity to ruin the situation for a second time - a sign that he was more than anything a widespread comic creation designed for the territory of non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He was certainly a stupid secret agent who was posing oddly to relax the glamour of Clouseau's personality, a little Mr. Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He was also inspired by the mysterious international traveller and spy agent, Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving a mess afterwards.
There was a great moment or two in JE's latest movie.
I love Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval combat suit and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy was on the air, but his sense of humor was very weak and strange, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
The joke felt as if it was being promoted for children over adults, and for me Johnny English's unintentional mistake was not innovating and focusing on the Atkinson films in the persona of Bean.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a secret network of British web sites, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field and disappointing the agents on duty - a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for the arrogant and politically unpopular Prime Minister: Emma Thompson gave her best with this Teresa May side character but nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence advisor told him every active spy had been compromised, and he needed to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is a crook and now works as a schoolteacher in some fancy place, but gives lessons that are not appropriate for being a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers espionage at academies like School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former aide Bough, reprised by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a flamboyant character played by the rather disadvantaged Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the brilliant Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action against the beautiful tease of Olga Kurylenko's Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being wooed by a charismatic tech millionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventure with small tasks: disguising themselves as waiters, lighting fires and setting fire to French restaurants; painstakingly smuggling themselves onto Volta's luxury cruise ship; and English sparking chaos as she tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get herself used to the interior of Volta's home.
All the funny scenes were well-executed for the final act, but because it seemed friendly and down-to-earth there was a bit of a children's television show feel to it.
It's a rather simple film.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I kept thinking: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really matched her talent?
Labour Nafi plans for British people to work four days a week but get paid for five
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see Britons work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
It will see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay.
Sources said the idea was "in line" with the party's economic agenda and plan to bring the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the economic change.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight but working four days a week is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to balancing the economy and favoring workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.'
Labour was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration was not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workweek is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to advance his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power away from the "faceless directors" and "record holders" of the utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means, current shareholders in the water company may not get their entire stake back as the Labour government can make 'cuts' on the grounds they are deemed to have committed a crime.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 per cent of private sector firm equity to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to give their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I told him I wanted to attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the allegations came up, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, determined, clear".
Anyway, Graham's vote is already cast.
"I've already made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to take a heavy toll", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has consistently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he named couldn't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
Say I see no change".
What is World People's Day and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive lineup of great stars and their equally great mission; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather on the Great Central Park Square to not only watch performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To receive free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as becoming a volunteer, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how far are the people of the world on track with 12 years to go to achieve their goals?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to demand action, or just another case of clicktivism - making someone feel like they've done something by just signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says they have recorded 19 million actions from its supporters, urging movements with different goals.
They said these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least $10 billion of that total has already been raised or raised.
The group also estimates that these identified funds have impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key committees include Nutrition Power, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 submissions from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, the federal government and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make this social inequity of food imbalance a thing of the past", Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman said during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving over 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced to fund a project, Power Nutrition, which will now reach 5 million women and children in need.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on his website that asks: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: This is a difficult and time-consuming journey - we will be disappointed and desperate at times.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we're going to succeed, because when we work together, we're going to get stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Home Secretary
Washington could  if necessary  use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil to markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claims Russian involvement in Syria - as it is known, they engaged at the invitation of the Syrian government - supposedly to find new oil markets.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is to control oil supplies as they have done in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there is a way to get around this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to keep the sea lanes open, and if necessary, to blockade to keep their oil from being marketed", he said.
Zinke said this while speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of the oil consumer" in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, stressing that they are the same.
"The economic choices over Iran and Russia are more or less the same, affecting and replacing oil", he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its economy so dependent on oil.
The statement was issued as the Trump administration was on a mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe that were much cheaper to European consumers, replacing Russia.
Because of this, Trump officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "overly heavy" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will leave Berlin in the grip of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will increase the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters and that it is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington, which is so strongly opposed to the project, is doing so for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we can agree that energy supply should not be used as a weapon of oppression and consumers should be free to choose", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US action has drawn the displeasure of the German state, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and also on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our country's energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think hard" about running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" before becoming a presidential candidate following the midterm elections.
When the open question was asked by residents of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider running.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our fractured government and that includes putting a woman at its top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will think carefully about running for president.
Warren expressed his concerns about President Donald Trump during an open-ended interview, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction".
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been highly critical of Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a federal judge.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "it's clear we need an FBI investigation before the vote is taken".
However, a poll on Thursday, showed that a majority of residents in the area Warren represents feel Warren should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Science Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent support him running.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting his potential to run and 48 percent disagreeing.
Other high-profile Democratic members who are also being discussed as potential candidates in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin highlights the PTSD track Palin at the Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my own son went through, when I got home, I could feel the feelings of other families who were dealing with these PTSD issues and those who came home with injuries", she said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the incident of her son's detention was "something significant" and she said of her son and other war veterans as, "They came home different, rather harsh and wondered if they would be commended for their sacrifice to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington backed a crackdown on the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia voted to oppose a U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang attacks or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a petition to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, NBC news reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case Grace v. Sessions a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and his son's violent gang members had sponsored him but U.S. officials had denied his asylum application on July 20.
He's being held in Texas.
Prosecutors in the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the highest number of people seeking asylum in the U.S., as countries plagued by gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum application policy reverses a decision made in 2014 where the Board of Immigration Appeals had allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia's Attorney General said in a statement Friday that the new policy "does not override decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances leading to the application, and preventing it would violate that principle, according to a statement the friend gave to the court.
Prosecutors also argued that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country would worsen the U.S. economy by saying that these immigrants would likely become entrepreneurs and "workforce demands".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered an immigration judge to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum will be granted to those who leave their homelands for fear of persecution because of race, ethnicity, nationality or because of membership in a particular social group or adherence to a different political stance, Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to solve all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Rescue efforts are intensifying in Palu while the death toll is doubling
For those who survived, the situation is critical.
"I feel very stressed", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was nursing her feverish baby boy at the evacuation centre in the collapsed city of Palu.
Ambulance is bringing a body every minute.
The drinking water supply is very limited.
Residents seem to be slowly returning to their destroyed homes, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, which was too severe.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, are resting outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to the aftershock.
Tears were flowing as he scanned back as the quake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There's no one to save us.
I was trapped in a collapsed wall, I guess", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife's voice asking for help, then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "spoofing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese state-run newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper detailing the mutual good of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid ad in the China Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election explains what US officials have reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure the Chinese state.
It is common practice for foreign governments to run ads to promote trade, with Beijing and Washington now locked in a worsening trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial move in this trade war is to target exporters in states like Iowa that support the Republican Party represented by Trump, say Chinese and US foreign policy experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing's move had upset many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a newsroom in the Des Moines Register on Sunday writing, is now more bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent newspapers.
"In spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government embraces the freedoms practiced by the Americans, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the Beijing press, there is very little opposition and you cannot see the real view of the public about the direction of China's economy that is worried because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major newspapers in China has avoided an offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are pushing women out of the midterm elections because of Kavanaugh's story, analysts warn.
While many prominent Republicans support and favor Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Federal Court facing sexual harassment charges, analysts warn they will invite a backlash, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
High emotions are clouding the story and most Republicans say on record they will go ahead with the vote.
Those things cannot be changed, said Grant Reeher, a political science professor from the Maxwell Center for Studies, Syracuse University in an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is not convinced that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) move to force the FBI to launch an investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and also in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a protest in the Senate building's courtyard as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say this is too high; it's true.
This is probably higher especially for women voters who will be voting from the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, these people don't like the president and rarely vote.
Before Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against her by a Federal Court nominee, analysts feared a landslide if Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
"This has been a very complicated thing for the GOP", said Michael Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh succeeds as a federal judge, it's also about how the Republicans handle this issue and how they treat him", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats to the newsroom.
However, the American public seems split in two and doesn't know who to trust in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony with more than half in favor of Ford.
A recent YouGov poll showed 41 percent said they would or probably would believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other allegation, reports Deborah Ramirez, of The Guardian newspaper.
Last week Ford made an affidavit before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had drugged him when he was 17.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court nominee also showed his penis in front of Ford during a party while he was a student at Yale University around the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to rival Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is an open-source company based on the Solid software creation of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real goal was "to rule the world".
"We need to do this now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may contain contact lists, daily work lists, calendars, playlists and other personal professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all coming in one browser and all at once.
What's unique about storing data in these private storage is that it's up to the user to decide who can access the type of information they need.
The company calls it "personal dominance through data".
The goal for this Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring specific resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developer staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own standalone apps without being centralized in any location using the features available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee also said that he and his team had no discussions with Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a change where all their business models would change immediately.
We're not asking for their permission.
In an article in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, "Inrupt, its mission is to provide a business powerhouse and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of new websites built using Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been vocal about the need for the Web to be independent.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest of the Victoria Cross of the First World War commemorated
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combat soldier has been commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Father Benard Vann who received this award on 29 September 1918 in the raids at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by snipers four days later and did not know he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
A memorial stone was erected and a curtain unveiled by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a glorious symbol" because the stone will open the curtain 100 years after his grandfather's brave deed.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin which was filled with thick fog and faced a massive machine-gun attack.
He then proceeded to the border and with "extraordinary courage" and led it before proceeding with a single rifle and shooting three men.
The Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never do again and it was so moving".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a bouquet of flowers after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of this march" and added "real courage" to the support that has been given by so many people.
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you're up all night watching Bellator 206 but are disappointed to see the main show.
The list from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six major matches which will be broadcast live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to collide, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast switched to the Peppa Pig show.
Some of them are angry because they stayed up all night to watch the game.
One fan said the switch to the children's cartoon channel "a no-nonsense joke" through his chat.
"Government regulations indicate that 6am broadcasts are not suitable for matches so they have to broadcast for children", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
- The pig is a pig.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they were working to reschedule the broadcast so that UK viewers could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about rebroadcasting, I think we can do something", Coker said.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning, so we couldn't do anything until Sunday, our time, which was Monday, their time.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast is switched, there's a lot of texting going on, and it's not all good to hear.
We're working on this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more of a government issue.
I promise this will never happen again.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six -- as usual -- and we're trying to do something that's impossible to do for fans.
This is a sad situation.
Tom Daley has a low opinion of sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a low self-esteem because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
She was 24 years old and didn't realize anything until she was in high school and felt like not everyone was like me.
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said after he was a dad, he didn't care so much about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kris Young took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing abruptly in the first show of Laverne, Daley said that she felt inferior to her peers growing up because she was not socially accepted as either male or female.
He said: To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others is what has motivated me and given me the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was something he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to get more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke this way because he felt lucky to be able to live in the open without any problems and wanted to give hope to others like him.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - was "unexpected"
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- she took part in her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later -- she says it's very hard to find someone in her age bracket who goes through the same challenges.
The couple became fathers in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all perspectives" of his life have now changed.
If you ask me last year, it was all about "I need to win the gold medal", he said.
There's actually something more than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
Her son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if their tickets to London 2012 were already bought - because he wanted to sit in the front seat once.
I can't bear to say that I won't be there to sit in the front row.
I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and not until my father stopped breathing and was legally dead did I realize that my father would not live forever.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I realized this is what I have dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country at the Olympics, no other spectacle can match this", he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which was a stunner for her during her preparations for the Olympics and still made her romance rag.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's not so ready to face the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup competition, but he will have to be prepared to make up for his performance in the game if he doesn't end up in a bad situation.
Mickelson, who will play in the biennial event for a record 12 times, was relieved by captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes games on Saturday.
Instead of being the usual focus for the United States, the winners of these five major tournaments spent time cheering and training in the hope of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even when he's at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for Le Golf National, where long distances are particularly difficult for missed shots.
And if this golf course alone is tougher, Mickelson in game nine on Sunday will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the American, four points behind in 12 singles starts, starts strong, then Mickelson's game must be very important.
Furyk is so confident in his players, that's all he can say.
"He understood his role today, and patted my shoulder and put his hand on my shoulder and said he would be ready by tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a big name and he's done a lot for this team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine that he would play in two tournaments.
I imagine more than that, but that's the way and the way we think we should do it.
He wants to be part of it, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances this Sunday.
This may be the last time he'll play in the Ryder Cup, which has never matched his personal best.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven, although Furyk said his presence brought a boost to his team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to dress people up and it's fun when he's in the team room", she said.
I think all the young players have had a good time with him this week, and it's fun to watch.
He's not just a playboy but more than that.
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows their lead will be lost.
The European team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knew from experience that the far-forward position he held could be lost on the final day of the Ryder Cup and complicate matters.
The Danish player first competed in the 1997 tournament at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros was driving as captain and led the American team by 5 points but was only able to win very narrowly once with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself after the lead up at Valderrama; we also got the lead up at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but won thinly", said Bjorn after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead by 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on this team that this game is not over.
We'll fight to the death tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and make no mistakes.
This isn't over until the eyes are picked up and put on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and we're going to focus on that goal.
I told you, I'm going to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we all have to realize who we're up against - they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy with his men's performance on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I can't be proud.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow, individual achievement has to stand out and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when everything's going well but when you're alone then your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is a message all players need to hear, give your best tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he has to give the best in himself too.
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would have expected his players to play better as individual players than in team events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three points out of four.
Furyk himself had an experience on the final day where the position changed, when he was in the team that was winning in Brookline before losing by surprise when the European team performed the "Miracle" in Medina.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, burned the spirit of the players on the final day.
We have 12 more shows tomorrow, but if you guys want to get started quickly like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
We're gonna line up our players in a way that we think is appropriate, and we're gonna try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with fighting back and clashing with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter of the top-ranked European first division.
"I made this rule because I think it will be fair and inclusive", Bjorn said of individual player choice.
The new German battleship is delayed again
The German Navy was due to receive its newest frigate in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleship, but the ship will not be completed until next year due to system failures and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The commissioning of the battleship Rhineland-Pfalz, the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing an army spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems hampered the fate of this major project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that it will contain features such as high-powered cannon, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship equipment as well as some stealth features such as reduced detection by radar, red lights and acoustic capabilities.
Another important feature was the longer maintenance time range - these new frigates had to be able to sail for up to two years from their base.
However, various obstacles meant that the advanced battleship - which was said to be capable of projecting German power abroad - would be obsolete by the time it entered naval service, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German naval officials refused to repatriate the warship in and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to its builder after delivery.
Little is known about the reason for the return, but German newspapers cite several "software and hardware" failures that rendered the battleship unfit for combat missions.
The software failure had to be taken into account as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships would be operated by only 120 squadrons - half of what was needed to operate the old Bremen-class frigates.
There are also instances where the warship is too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne battleship Rheinland-Pfalz was believed to be twice as heavy as the battleships of the same class once used by the German army during World War II.
Aside from damage to the device, the overall cost of the project - including training for the crew - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from its original price of €2.2 billion.
The trouble with the latest frigate shows how weak the German Navy is.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee, admitted the navy was facing a serious shortage of capable warships.
The official also said the issue was worsening, as the old battleships that had been decommissioned were not getting replacement battleships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust colonizes the bat's life
A recent study being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to explain why bats use the shape of the Earth's surface to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to new discoveries about the behaviour of this unique flying mammal and could serve as a guide for conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bat, and the pipistrelles soprano bat as well as the long-eared brown bat and the Daubenton bat in Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at specific locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using mobile tracking devices.
The sound analysts of all the recordings will identify the frequency of each bat species and its behavior.
A habitat map and reports will be produced to create a scale-up map of the bat's behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the results of this study will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This information will help identify habitat management benefits such as creating grasslands and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined dramatically over the past century.
The bat is threatened by building and development work that disrupt its habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats similar to fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
Actually, bats are not blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use sound-based location-based techniques to identify insects and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is of particular concern to bats.
They have ten trained specialists who often conduct surveys, inspect the shelters and occasionally rescue bats.
The organisation has also established a bat sanctuary, the first in Scotland, at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
David Thompson, the estate manager, said this estate was the best place for bats.
"There's a place in Thereave that's perfect for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of big trees and good habitats.
There's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and thrive.
He stressed the importance of conducting a thorough inspection before starting maintenance work on the property because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy a bat's nest that would contain bat cubs where this would kill 400 female and young bats, and possibly wipe out the entire local bat population.
Bats are protected and it is a crime to kill, harass or disturb or destroy bat nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to help.
He said: "There's still a lot to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their populations grow".
Ronaldo denies the rape charges while his lawyer prepares to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the rape allegations against him were "fake news" and said people were trying to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel that published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was later said to have paid $375,000 to silence the victim according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news".
That's not true.
What they said today was fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
Get used to it.
They want to be famous by calling my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, said the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegation, which they call "an unsubstantiated report and intrusion into privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek damages for "moral damage that directly affects his personality, which may be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a luxury room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of passing by the woman without permission, according to investigative papers filed in Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident the player knelt before him and said he was 99% a good man and only bowed down because of 1%.
The document confirms Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but on the grounds of sexual intercourse.
Mayorga also claimed that he made a police report and took pictures of the injuries he suffered while in the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court because he was "afraid of the reaction" and worried about "public scorn".
The 34-year-old woman now wants to reverse the previous settlement because she's still traumatized by what happened.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester when the allegations came to light, and this summer he had moved to Italian football giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing its car manufacturer
The UK will forever regret losing its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that this was "a bit concerning" because Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a solution, it would temporarily stop production of cars at its plant in Burnsaston, near Derby.
"We need a solution", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of this would result in problems with border deliveries if there is no solution to Brexit and this would lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal by the end of March, we will stop production of cars at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Several other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW as well as Jaguar and Land Rover have also expressed their concerns if the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of carmakers is the risk to the supply chain if there is a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota car production relies on an assembly basis based on timely receipt of supplies without the need for storage with car parts brought in to the factory every 37 minutes from across the UK and European Union for the ordered cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there is a high probability of border turmoil that industry players predict will result in delays and shortages of spare parts.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store more than a day's supply of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will then be halted.
Mr Clark said Finance Minister Theresa May's future plans for bilateral relations with the European Union "need to be carefully crafted to avoid any border checks".
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow us not just to succeed for now but to seize this opportunity", he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term warned of rising costs and reducing the competitiveness of the plant and subsequently resulting in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade unionist who is responsible for the union management at the plant, says union members are already starting to worry: In my experience, lost jobs will not return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and solid plan for the future relationship between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed to next week" because of the ongoing dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for federal court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and further hamper Mueller's freedom to pursue his investigation has been the hottest rumor in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was planning to wear a secret recorder to record his conversations with Trump and possibly to replace the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went naked to the White House, despite reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him clashing with Kavanaugh's confession and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, to whom they both gave a confession.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which has further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, probably this week, I think it may be postponed for another week given some things going on in the federal court.
We'll see about that later and I'll keep the press updated.
Some reporters will argue: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
When the host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said he doesn't hold many press conferences not because he doesn't like TV news reporters trying to get "attention" but he also said: "I disagree because they do want attention".
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would grow.
"The president has held the most question and answer sessions of any president before him", he said without providing any evidence.
The press conference will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States something directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've done a lot of that over the last few weeks and this will replace the press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the press on his way out of the White House or when participating in open questioning sessions or during press conferences with distinguished guests.
One-on-one press conferences are extremely rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes makes freaky and bizarre appearances in front of a gathering of reporters.
The Health Secretary writes to EU NHS workers about their concerns about Brexit
The health secretary has written to all EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express his gratitude to the country and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MP has sent a letter of formal notice of a period of less than six months before the UK leaves the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applying for EU citizenship working in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, and are on track to reach a conclusion by the autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is something that's very concerning to all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Our colleagues from across the European Union and beyond, bring together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health services and benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the second half.
"He came close to the edge and collapsed there", Reed said.
Coach and medical officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in the tray and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "there is no information on the type/ extent of his injury at this time" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt freshman, played his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five sacks on Saturday before he was out of the game, his total for the season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the surplus money will be used to help homeless people under the Tory's latest scheme.
This move will undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to draw up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - money from this will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
This move seems to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise of affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, money from this revenue will help the government tackle the problem of homelessness.
This surcharge - is in addition to the stamp duty already imposed including the higher duty that was introduced two years ago on second homes and houses bought for rent which may be charged three percent.
The Treasury is expected to be able to collect up to £120 million a year through this move.
An estimated 13 percent of new properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, causing prices to soar and making it difficult for those looking to buy their first home.
Most of the luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "silent" because many of their owners are foreigners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut so more young people could buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of deliberately keeping property prices high by buying land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to tackle Britain's shameful housing problem.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rental controls and the abolition of "innocent" evictions.
He also wanted more power to be given to council members to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life must be better for each and every generation to come.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair because it is so easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad to buy a house compared to British residents who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the fact of living in a humiliated place is a reality.
Jack Ross: My main goal is to manage Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa says his ultimate goal is to manage Scotland one day.
The 42-year-old Scot looks forward to a challenging opportunity to reinvigorate the North-East club who are third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for the B cap and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always drew me there.
That opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
Ross' successors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athetic said he was not keen to follow in the footsteps of the names that are so well known in the big clubs, as he had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success at this point is about getting this club back into the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities that the club has, it should be in the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to achieve, but I would consider myself successful if I could get this club back into the Premier League.
Ross has only been in management for three years, having been assistant manager at Dumbarton and was one of the coaches at Hearts for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa back to the third tier after relegation and changed the fortunes of St Mirren from relegated to becoming Champions the following season.
And Ross says he's much more comfortable now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was an option", he recalls, when managing Alloa.
I know the management field is more my thing than the acting.
It may sound strange, but I'm doing well, I'm living a good life and having some exciting times.
Playing is a little hard.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I still go through it in terms of the pressure and the pressure of working as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I love for the rest of my adult life.

The best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
This summer's heat wave brings good luck to Britain's troubled pubs but the chain of restaurants is under pressure.
The pub and bar group showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it was down 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy firm CGA which compiled these figures, said: "The continued hot weather and the longer England World Cup campaign mean July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs rose 2.8 per cent, unless restaurants declined more severely.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
Pub performance that prioritizes drinks and bars is strong compared to the declining restaurant.
Food-oriented pubs also suffered badly from hot weather, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an entertainment and food analyst at RSM, said: "This decision seems to have remained the same and has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and social or sporting events are still major factors in the increase in sales in the outdoor market.
No wonder the restaurant group continues to shrink, sales down 4.8 percent year-on-year, which would be worse with the cost pressure.
The long hot summer weather is hitting restaurant operators at a critical time and only time will tell if colder weather like we experienced in August will bring relief.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a dampening in newly introduced brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, an observer for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sales sector, collected and analysed performance data from 47 groups operating with a turnover of £9 billion, an industry benchmark.

Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director during the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a renowned Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as an opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive international experience of more than a decade.
ilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from his involvement in the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: I want to be the voice of all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide this sport in Scotland
The American athlete, who won gold medals in the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, now has four Olympic gold medals and is now covering the BBC, after being unable to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He made a comment: "This is the day last month I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell how well I could recover.
It's not easy to be the same, I have to learn to walk again and today I have to do some intelligence training!
Thank you for all your support!
A mom's milk pump ad comparing it to a cow has led to conflicting opinions online
A company that makes breast milk pumps got mixed reviews online because their ad compares a nursing mother to a cow being pressed for milk.
To launch what is said to be the world's first silent, wearable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous music video to show the freedom mothers can experience using this new pump.
Four mothers dancing in a hay-filled cowshed to a song whose lyrics read: "Yes, I pump my own milk, but you can't see any tails" and "If you don't realize this isn't my nipples, this is my breasts".
The negative is: "I'm pumping out, I'm pumping out, I'm breastfeeding, I'm pumping out, I'm pumping out, I'm pumping out my breasts".
However, the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has attracted mixed reactions from the public, many saying it provides a "happy" glimpse into the dairy industry's "terrible" state.
It's an inappropriate decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Like us, cows need to sow and give birth to produce milk, but unfortunately calves are separated from their mother within a few days of birth, says one author.
Elvie's milk pump can be inserted completely into the breastfeeding coli secretly (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: It's a real trauma for the cow and the calf.
But what's the use of using them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: One ad that has nothing to do with it directly.
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "deeply funny".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'll buy one if I still give you body milk.
Pumping makes me feel like a real cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm taking it as it comes.
This is a product of genius", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad for moms who pump (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with pumps hidden in their underwear.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the assumption that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Pam Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be concealed in a shirt under the breast, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women who pump with dairy cows, we want to put body pumps and all the challenges associated with them as the main focus, while showing ways to entertain and connect with the feeling of independence through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage at a showcase for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of child migrants move quietly to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of migrants detained has increased despite the monthly border relocations not changing much, due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, making the placement of children with sponsors more difficult.
Traditionally, the guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they fear compromising their status to remain in the country if they take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult family members would have to hand over their fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals, whether they are policyholders or family members of policyholders, are here illegally and most of them are illegal immigrants.
With that, we'll keep on hunting the individual", Albence said.
To process children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as was the previous standard, according to protection workers.
Many will be appearing via video conference call, rather than appearing in person, to plead their case for legal standing before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer such children are under custody, they are more likely to become anxious or discouraged, and this will lead to aggressive actions or attempts to escape, according to protection officials and according to reports issued by the system in recent months.
Supporters say that the concern is higher in larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs that children are struggling with emotions may not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They add that moving children to a camp town without providing time for them to prepare emotionally, or to say goodbye to friends may only exacerbate the trauma they are experiencing.
Syria directs US, French and Turkish troops to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, urged Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country has now reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism "will be subjected to appropriate action".
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the conference.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terror is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this holy war until we clear Syrian territory" of both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically to train and advise the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the warring nations' soil.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were favorable for their return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return", he said.
"They politicize what should be purely human affairs".
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said an agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a no-military zone in rebel-held Idlib created an opportunity to resume political talks.
The Russian-Turkish talks have reversed a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the region where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had a "real time limit" and expected military action to target jihadists including rebels from the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be eliminated".
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to organize the first meeting of the new committee, which will include government and opposition members to draft a post-war resolution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the current constitutional articles", and warned against interference.
Because Trump is going to win a second term.
With that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expected, impeachment charges and scandal ended his presidency prematurely.
In what is undeniably the most dramatic finale to a presidential term!
At this time, there is no sign of a lazy observer.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average prime-time audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had topped cable ratings, reaching 3.5 million viewers on the night of the news premiere.
"This is a fire that attracts people's attention because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in chaos.
True, unlike what you see on TV, the story line that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or the health of the global economy.
Not keeping up with the latest developments is just a treat for the lucky viewer.
However, it's a far cry from being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of "deep background" by Bob Woodward's search for sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 camelskin bomber jacket ("thick cloth with a self-assured dignity", says The Washington Post) and a sensational account by Stormy Daniels of Trump's ah, anatomy.
I'm never gonna see Super Mario with that same look again.
"Some of what he does is like a reality show where it looks like he's feeding you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars", about Trump's story with his daily casting and plot changes (starting a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode or you'll miss out.
When I visited Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home in northern Kauai, but he was stuck in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He can't leave TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we did this crazy show once and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western Civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but they really do get along".

Foreign money flooded into the fierce contest of the midterm election hall
It's not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania general election showed a flood of money, given the re-unification of congressional districts shows two officials now running for the same seat.
The redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is contested by Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is competing against another current official, Republican Representative Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been drawn to the Republican side.
The new 17th inning contest has started a fierce campaign finance contest between the major party finance machinery of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District that was well-attended.
The seat had been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
A bunch of smart, smart politicians have given the Democrats the upper hand.
The U.S. is considering fining El Salvador for its support of China, then backtracking.
Diplomats from the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until a partner kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
Government Department officials decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have a negative impact on the Central American country with its high rates of displacement and homicide.
After internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in curbing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively halting any consideration of fining El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, signaling the import of the administration's place in the meeting, according to diplomats.
And the three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no message or firm sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were backed by outside analysts close to the administration and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical studies
What's coming next is probably the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which now has strong evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also lead an investigation into whether the Trump campaign has joined with Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on that side, once he's ready to face the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury that includes his peers.
This is all if, and I'm not saying that the fall of Trump is certain - or people like him in Europe.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this struggle lasts.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to make an attempted coup against Hitler, if the West had not followed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed the opportunity to prevent the brutal killings that will occur in the years to come.
The course of history revolves around such an inflection point, and the unbridled course of democracy will be accelerated or delayed.
The American people are facing some of these inflection points right now.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that, last year, he had planned to film the president and speculate that the president was unfit for the position.
Rosenstein said the Times's account was inaccurate.
"How will we act if the new request for an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite clear charges of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And more importantly, are we going to vote for a midterm congressional election that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy house.
He survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
With that in my legacy, how can I be less optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, following a draw with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers used this decision as a stepping stone to a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this tournament with the belief that we would get something and we got a point.
We might be able to win at the end of the game, but the draw might be a fairer outcome.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hoped we got three points but the match was difficult because they got good results in the previous game but, the audience supported us, I am sure we will play well and get a positive result.
Last year was tough, with everything that happened with my injury, and the exchanges at the club, but there's a fun factor about this place now.
The squad is good and the team is having fun; the training is good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and make it".
Women can't sleep because of this pension savings worry
While the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, some had already discussed it with their family members.
Half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they had discussed with their spouse the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but don't take steps to talk", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide insurance business.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won't be able to provide a family to provide care for you if you don't tell them first.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as that choice will be a major factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care financing can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Finish your legal paperwork: Finish the legal war at a time.
Put health care representatives in place so you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your health care and have a professional at your disposal if you can't communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You'll choose people you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're unable to.
Remember the little details: Imagine your grandmother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write down these details in a plan so that you are prepared.

"What is the cure?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Set the plan".

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 have been killed as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, with the death toll expected to rise.
With no communication systems, authorities were unable to get information from Donggala government, a northern Palu area close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu over 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is an administrative region 300 km (180 mi) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The administrative region, under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the backbone of the Central Sulawesi region's economy, especially in the Donggala waters.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is only concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast to Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsunami several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Acheh province, Indonesia north of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of dead on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that sweeps along the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Kota Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills 300 people.
2016: A moderate-magnitude earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya governorate area of Acheh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastating events of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but over 100 people died due to the collapse of the building.
2018: A powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded at the time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of domestic assault, disrupting domestic violence crime reports and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, while the woman's friend tried to make a call to the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from the woman.
Palin is being held in custody at Mat-Su's pre-trial facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he has pleaded "definitely, not guilty" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
This case is being heard in Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, disrupting domestic violence crime reports and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend claims the guy punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veterans group in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD following his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were also affected with deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck outside Central Sulawesi which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media show the time of the incident.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the coast.
Prosecutors are demanding an extraordinary death sentence for the suspect in the New York City terror attack.
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bicycle lane attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, ramming pedestrians and cyclists in his path on Oct.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intended" to kill the eight victims and "intended" to inflict serious bodily harm, according to the notice with intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder by illegal activity, which are always used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of terrorism and destroying a motor vehicle.
The attack required "careful planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "violent, cruel and degrading".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a while since the Southern District of New York has taken a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced after they were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, pleaded not guilty in the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to investigators that he felt happy with what was being done, according to police.
Saipov said he was driven to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS video on his phone, according to the allegations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "absolutely disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We felt the decision to seek the death penalty over accepting a guilty plea for a life sentence with no possibility of parole, only prolonged the trauma of the event for all involved", according to Patton.
Saipov's defense has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
According to the Tory MP, Nigel Farage should be responsible for running the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to 'move the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should 'feel the sting' of the Eurosceptics - because one of Theresa May's MPs, recommended she should be given the responsibility of handling negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the UK would 'leave now' if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May was to resolve the split between members who supported the Remain Tories who joined the city's Brexit protests.
The Prime Minister is working to ensure that the Chequers tolerance plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insist May is pursuing negotiations with Brussels despite the repercussions - and the power of Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or 'chaos'.
Bone told the meeting that getting out meant getting out in Solihull, which meant getting rid of the Chequers.
He recommended Farage for the peerage and gave him the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If he had been given the responsibility, we'd be out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit but we must get rid of Chequers.'
Setting out a protest against the EU, he said: 'We are not fighting the world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely wrong.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers are not popular with the public, the Opposition will not vote for them, it is not popular in our party and the activists who are on the streets and who have voted for us.
Please drop your chequers and start listening.'
In a message to May, he added: 'The prime minister will continue to hold office if she keeps her word.'
Farage said politicians need to 'feel the sting' if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now it's a trust between us - the people - and the political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here to tell them 'we will not let them get away with it.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the sting.
"We are preparing to mobilize the people's army that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, self-governing, proud".
Meanwhile, the Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a rally in the city centre.
Activists waved Tories' banners against Brexit after the group's launch over the weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they were facing with party applications as the conference began.
'They said they could have IT systems in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borderlessness, for borderless trade,' he added.
'It's all a show.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to study to run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat presented his future plans during a town hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He was speculated to be running against Trump in 2020.
Saturday's noon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the convention using the town hall format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and this includes a woman upstairs".
Arrest made in the shooting death of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They have released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the scene, having a gun and confessing to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears the World Championship gap when the team orders him to win, beating Sebastian Vettel
It was obvious at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, "the Mercedes team's direction played a crucial role in this race.
Instead of a flat start, Bottas started well, nearly beating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and prompting Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel got in the pits first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should have been final.
Mercedes then entered the pits on the next lap and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire-to-tyre action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free at the risk of defending after the third corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and was seventh after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and did not change tyres to aim for a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to improve speed for the next eight laps when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
A tough day for Valtteri who has been racing well all weekend and his manly nature allows me to make the cut.
The team did a great job to win first and second place", said Hamilton.
That's not good sign language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally over a woman's insistence that he not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault charges.
Speaking to a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly respond to testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people to be "cruel and ugly and liars".
"One thing that can happen and a beautiful thing happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and cruel and ugly and lying people", he said.
"When you look at the exposure and the leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember the answer... did you leak the documents - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't leak it".
All right, hold on a second.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak", he added, making the senator's face.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh Ford last July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leaks came from his office.
"I'm not highlighting Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking his story", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as requested".
But the woman's denial did not please the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday: "I tell you, that is bad gesture language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst sign language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see, cruelty, abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control", Mediaite reported the president saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by a score of 3-0
Patrick Dwyer scores for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee star made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants lead with a two-run victory on the back of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home standings before Dwyer recovered the victory for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised the points for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed them victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from below to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
The opening for Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford providing an assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what seemed like a busy opening hour, Sullivan raised the host's eyeball at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the game during the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first half.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the situation with a goal at 27:37.

Air traffic controllers killed to ensure hundreds on board planes survived the quake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as heroes after being sacrificed after securing the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a massive earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the rubble in Kota Palu.
Although his companion escaped, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung, refused to leave his control point in the strongly shaking control tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He did not move to ensure that Flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We've arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is still rising due to many bodies still under the rubble as well as many who are uncontactable", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
A 20-foot-high wave has destroyed the Palu that will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing back a body.
Clean water is hard to come by.
Small shops are being remodeled everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors but we don't know what will be found there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing over 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one passenger is missing after plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia said today that one passenger was missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, the airline was unsure of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
A local boat helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday, seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane went off the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway at low altitude.
"That was a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers made it through waist-deep water to the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he only had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said crews near the refurbished pier also provided assistance using inflatable boats to transfer passengers to shore before the plane sank into 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows 111 people have died in PNG-registered plane crashes in the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts give a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors are reopening Saturday's retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the defendant's 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he received several location data from several cell phones that suggest Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, contradicting earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed his cell phone along with Chambers's phone while he was charging along with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had "lied because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is, Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman died.
Cell phone records show that they've known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis deleted the text of his calls and Chamber's contact information from his phone.
"He has erased the woman from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to a jury later that afternoon.
The High Breed: Is hip hop sensitive?
The hip hop trio wanted to change the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim hip hop has moved away from their original purpose, which was to convey a political message and solve social problems.
They want to get back to basics and make hip-hop sensational popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sues her fired husband for texting her "racist"
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message that was mistakenly sent from a mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denied being racist, equating the lawsuit to "racial harassment".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"NO LONGER a black woman", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
She wanted to text her husband, but instead she texted Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman who felt "less comfortable" fired Maurice, saying that the previous nanny, an African-American, was not doing a good job and he expected a nanny from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice gets paid for a day's work and drives home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demanding compensation in the amount of $350 a day for six months, compensation for the accommodation he was offered, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not supposed to do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to accusations that they are racist, saying Maurice's termination was justified because they felt the woman could not be trusted after offending her.
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your child in the care of someone you have abused, even if it was a crime?
Your newborn?
I won't".
Calling the lawsuit "a rush", Plasco said his wife had just given birth to a child two months ago and was in a "confidential situation".
"Would you put someone in such a situation?
Not a good thing", added the investment banker.
As the case went on, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them for their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers are concerned readers will find it difficult to relate to a talking bear, new paper reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it comes out.
It's heartbreaking now that we know about Paddington's success".
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book, a small teddy bear, felt optimism about his work was rejected, she added, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication being "bitter sweet" after her father's death last year.
Of Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family", he added, his father proud of his success in the end.
"My father was a quiet man, he was not a talker", she said.
"But, because Paddington is too alive for him, it's like having a child who achieves something you're proud of even though it's not what you made.
I think he sees Paddington's success in that way.
Although the bear was his creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself".
My son is dying and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, the girl was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, Nice where doctors did everything they could to save her life.
"Nad called me often to say that the situation was bad and that he would not be saved", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctor gave him to pump his heart slowly out of his system.
He died before his time and this is all off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing all this was gonna happen.
I couldn't growled or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning over the loss of her son, boarded the plane with other passengers - who were unaware of the bitter experience she was having.
"No one knows", he said.
"I bowed my head, and tears streamed at every turn.
It's hard to describe, but on this trip I felt a deep sympathy for Nad.
She needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her".
Sad woman sends postcard to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide, working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters on Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to contact for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, says his son is a potential musician with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew her by her smile.
They always say her smile can light up any room".
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's younger brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis says: "I feel a constant worry if this will cause the effect of other things to happen".
Davis invented the card, "to let people know that there's someone you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit in silence - you have to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"She didn't tell me that she was feeling sad or depressed or anything", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her temper.
She was very sad on Christmas Day--when the children opened their presents, she didn't look at them or anything".
She says that her partner's death was a great trauma for them, but they had to let it go: "It left a big hole in the family.
It's what separates us.
But we have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited investigation time, limited scope - we can bring it to a unity", Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee was "wrecked" in a stalemate based on deeply entrenched beliefs.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6th - if, as expected, the Republican results are unsatisfactory, they will be weaker to get the person they want appointed to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush had made a call to the senators, lobbying them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through Bush had met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares the report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are in session.
It's not clear if Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to tie the game and confirm his place on the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector numbers are down under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to the South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and high rates of human smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants rather than political refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on negotiations on a delayed nuclear disarmament.
This follows a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in common to move towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of slowing down the progress of talks since the incident.
"Without any confidence from the US, our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not initiate nuclear disarmament first", Ri said in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotional, and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court".
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his behavior was unsuitable to hold office in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the following comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they'll say she's 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and being in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "excessive and deliberate defamation" handled by liberal still-angry Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was unfit to hold a Supreme Court position, as it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I feel he has discredited himself and his actions against the Clinton family and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if she was confirmed, and if Democrats had a majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not qualified to hold the Supreme Court position, but only in the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she was considered a conservative court.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would reverse the Supreme Court's decision.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'How fun,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to show it.
It was a fitting low word, a swelling that lasted months and years, and she couldn't hold her anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't feel it's anything out of the ordinary, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive at a place, who said she also cries when she's angry, but she's invented a technique where if she gets angry and starts crying, she'll say to the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry".
Then he moved on.
And I think that's a wise suggestion".
Crying is allowed as a way to channel anger because it's always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories from my old job, in a male-dominated office, I found myself crying with a sense of uncontrollable anger, pulled by an older woman at the neck - a cold manager who I was terrified of - pulling me into the stairwell.
"Don't show them your tears", she told me.
"They don't know you're a bear.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that you're sad".
Patricia Schroeder, former congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair in a boat called Monkey Business out of the contest, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to prevent her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision", she said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates running and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Due to events at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in her efforts to establish a fund, and she vowed not to run until she had raised $2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found that his supporters who gave a man $1,000 would give him only $250.
"Do they feel I'm getting a discount?" he said.
When she spoke about not launching a formal campaign, she felt a range of emotions - grateful to those who supported her, disappointed with a system that made it difficult for her to solicit donations and that targeted non-candidate voters, and angry at sexism - and she felt a bullet.
"You'd think I was having a broken heart", recalls Schroeder of the way the media reacted to him.
"You'd think the Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking at the time, what would I put on my headstone?
"He was crying"?"
The US-China trade war may benefit Beijing
The outbreak of the US-China Trade War may be confusing, and while the battle is not over yet, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs that will affect $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, the effect of which is to impose a tax on half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way every time, most recently, by imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the US for any action, and the world's second largest economy is not feeling affected.
To make Washington back down means to submit to the will of the United States, but to submit to the United States in public is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war pressure could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two countries.
"A quick political decision by whether Washington or Beijing can start an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and look more dangerous than previous observers had anticipated", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of political refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism", he said.
The government will continue to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The situation is now ready for the voluntary return of refugees, to countries they were forced to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US Team by a final score of 16.5, 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, released a tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving up to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was pulled out in 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one, Dustin Johnson, down 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may be playing his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish player Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
"I rarely cry but I couldn't resist today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm really happy, really happy to get my trophy back.
This is for the team, and I am happy to help", Garcia said after the European victory.
He has handed the job to John Ram who has defeated US legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"The feeling of pride I felt, when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching the guy play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods suffered a defeat for all competitions in France and currently has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
Odd statistics by one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major championships second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good golf throughout the game.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance from his team, "I'm proud of them, they work hard.
There was a time this morning when we were giving supplies to the European team.
We're doing the best we can.
Congratulations to you, Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played brilliantly.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love all 12 of these men and I'm proud to be captain.
You need to lift your hat.
We have been defeated".
