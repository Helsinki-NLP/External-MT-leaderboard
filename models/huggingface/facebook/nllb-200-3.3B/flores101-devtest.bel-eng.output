Not only does this support the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that you don't normally get from studying fossil features, like color and the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brown on top and pale or red-yellow on the back.
This discovery provides a new insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed rachis trunk, but has secondary plumage features of whiskers and beards, the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a late evolutionary change compared to the other features.
Judging from the structure of the feather, it was probably not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or attract attention, and researchers assumed that even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the feather patterns did not represent the plumage of a young bird, but rather the adult plumage.
The researchers assume that although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows the adult animal's mane rather than the feathers of a baby bird.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech process, with voters closing in to a booth to retrieve a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the respective candidate and place it in an envelope.
After the voter is identified by the officials, the last one deposits the envelope in the ballot box and puts his signature on the voters' list.
The whole procedure is carried out in strict accordance with the French suffrage.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there were no envelopes in the boxes at the time of the vote and that no other envelopes (other than those dropped in the ballot box by duly authorized and registered voters) were dropped there.
To witness every step of the process, candidates can send their representatives, and in the evening, following a strictly controlled procedure, volunteers count the votes.

Kir Starmer, the Crown's counsel and attorney general, issued a statement this morning announcing the prosecution of Hoon and Price.
His cabinet post will be filled by Ed Davy, MP, and the trade and industry post, which Davy is leaving, is expected to be filled by Norman Lam, MP.
Price and Hyun are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Kadeback, 21, were killed in the crash, and Kadeback was driving.
Christopher Schneider would need plastic surgery on his face, and Edgar Vegelo would have been injured in his jaw and arm.
When Uka put a gun to the head of the fifth soldier, it didn't work, and Schneider now suffers from constant pain and is blind in one eye, missing a part of his skull, and his face now partly made of titanium.
Schneider gave his testimony from his own country via video link, while he was at a US Navy base.
In addition to Wednesday's competition, Karpaneda took part in two more individual races.
She first competed in the slalom, where she retired from the distance in the first race. 36 of 116 participants showed the same result.
She finished tenth in the women's giant slalom, with a total time of 4:41.30.[1] She was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first place, which was won by Austrian Claudia L√∂sch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth place, won by Jungi Dani of Hungary.[2]
Four skiers from the group of athletes with limited physical capabilities did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers were unable to qualify for participation in the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh Police.
"We have arrested five people for raping a Swiss tourist and we have been able to recover her mobile phone and laptop", said DK Arya, Deputy Inspector General.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampra Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of those being named as the accused.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, as reported by the police chief Chandra Shekhar Salanki.
Even though there were three people in the car when it hit the house, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
While emergency services were rescuing the driver of the red Audi TT, traffic on the road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked.
He was first moved to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeacon has since been in the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh, charged with the murder of her son.
She is awaiting charges and trial while in custody, but given the widespread publication of her photographs, any eyewitness testimony could be called into question.
In other parts of the UK this is common practice, however in Scotland the justice system works differently  the courts believe that the publication of the photographs could potentially be harmful.
"Journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path when they publish photos of the suspects", says Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Chancery of the High Court, empowered to prosecute criminals, informed journalists that at least until the indictment was presented, no further comment would be possible.
The document reportedly mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in order to preserve the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information received, among other topics covered by the document are the issues of the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, as well as the problem of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that the military presence in the valley be maintained for 10 years after the agreement is signed, while Palestine agrees to only five years.
The shooters who participated in the supplemental program to control the spread of animals had to be closely monitored by rangers because the program was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service in conjunction with the Sports Rifle Association of Australia, Inc. recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program, which is implemented under the auspices of the Sports Rifle Association.
Mick Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's park preservation and heritage program, said the four shooters selected for the first shoot were given comprehensive safety training and had been trained.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is the fifth election to the Interim Electoral Council in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the elected Interim Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
To the large anti-regime protests that began in October, Martelli responded with a commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and angry, was the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of the defective iPods have been reported, resulting in six fires and four people with minor burns.
According to a statement from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MET), the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of the use of the devices had information.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had received 34 new reports of heat-related illnesses that it had classified as "not serious".
In response, the ministry called the company's "carrying over" of the report "worth a sincere regret".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (at 21:19 on Friday in Greenwich).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of any destruction or accidents in the country.
Also, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has seized a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and held hostages of tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza was firing at the tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at this time at least six have been confirmed to have been killed.
Six hostages, including the elderly and children, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
The elderly Dame needed a toilet, so the photographers were held hostage instead of her.
Lessing followed in his father's footsteps and became a physician.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began to study the issue of premature births in his spare time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerates the maturation of the embryonic lungs.
According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency, government investigators found two so-called black boxes of flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. She passed away in the night two months later. It's quite original, like she is. Luna was a strong woman", said Tony Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldstone" Runnels said, "Luna was a wild child, no less than I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I'd like to think she's in a better place now".
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008 (based on a poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated that she believed that at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia should become a republic.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those surveyed, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of those surveyed, who believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent, who, on the contrary, believed that it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and take part in three relay events during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical form is questionable: he has complained quite a lot about his health.
He was not allowed to take pain medication because it was prohibited at the Games.
On January 25th, a mathematician and computer science professor at Central Missouri State University, Curtis Cooper, has created the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is thought that comets may have brought to Earth not only organic substances that can form proteins and serve as a source of life, but also water.
Given the distant past of Earth-colliding comets, scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, form.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says that with the NextGen system, planes will be able to fly shorter routes, helping to save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based RLS, it uses satellite technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and to give pilots more accurate information.
The amount of traffic is not increased, and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, besides, there is no parking for cars at ground level, as well as a parking-capture.
The probability of having to hold the game behind closed doors without the fans of the team increased, as it may be that there are not enough vehicles.
The formation of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands is described in a study published on Thursday in the journal Science.
According to a report by researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species took just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer. The emergence of a new species was made possible by crossing the endemic ground squirrel (Geospiza fortes) with the non-tutufted ground squirrel (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded into many different shapes, and it can be rolled into thin sheets.
You can pull it out into a very thin piece of wire that you can easily twist and braid, and you can also chew it open and cut it into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was occasionally used to decorate illustrated books  so-called  illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a particular chemical, and you can make your own acid-base indicator out of the juice of red cabbage.
The color of the cabbage juice changes with the level of acidity or alkali of a particular substance.
The pH of a test chemical is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders in a circle until they merge into one, and then with your wet hands, make a ball.
The moisture on your hands is reacting with the outer layers, creating this strange sensation, forming a kind of shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mahendra had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
In houses of the Minoan period in Greek cities of Crete and Santorini, the remains of sewer systems have been found.
Unitas were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman Empire, they were sometimes installed in public baths, where men and women were kept together.
You use a satellite to make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away.
In space, the satellite receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The space shuttle used a satellite to send a satellite into space, but scientists have to use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere refracts light and distorts the image.
To launch a telescope or satellite into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel changed the world in so many ways, moving faster and easier -- that's the greatest thing the wheel has done for us.
He gave us the trains, the cars, and many other forms of transportation.
Below are the medium-sized cats, and their prey is also medium-sized - they hunt both rabbits and antelope and deer.
In addition to all, many small cats (including domestic pets in the wild) hunt and eat numerous small prey - insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
But the secret of their success is that each cat has a niche, meaning that it has a unique function that it does not have to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most sociable of all cats, living in large flocks known as pride.
A pride may include up to three adult males who are related, and up to thirty females and juveniles.
In most cases, the females are closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride and wolf packs or dogs have many similarities, the latter being that they are very similar to lions (but not other big cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to prey.
The tiger can climb (but not so well), jump over long distances, swim, and pull with five times the strength of a human as a well-trained athlete.
The tiger is a member of the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (a panther genus). No other felines except these four can roar.
A tiger's roar is more like a rattle, a series of sharp, loud words, than a lion's high-pitched roar.
The acelot eats small animals, such as monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds, whenever possible. Almost all of the animals it preys on are much smaller than the acelot.
Scientists believe that the acelots track and locate prey by smell, by sniffing the tracks on the ground.
Their night vision gives them excellent vision in the dark, which helps them navigate confidently, hunt as an acelot, blend into the environment, and then launch a prey from hiding.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they came (say, when moving across a river or a mountain range or when such organisms migrate to a new island so that it is quite difficult for them to return), they often end up in an environment that is significantly different from the place from which they came.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different traits or adaptations than the ones they had before.
The original human population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, the animals become less and less like the main population from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later, the two populations will look so different that no one will ever classify them as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which actually means the creation of new species, is an inevitable and very important step in evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe, and they use the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants cook their food from sunlight through photosynthesis, but they also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and make our clothes, and we eat mostly plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants either.
In their day, these were super-riders, so they were afraid of nothing and no one but other dinosaurs.
Its long jaws, bristling with 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, meant that its prey was doomed.
The diet of the Masaura was that of fish, turtles, and other Masaura, and it is likely that they also ate members of their own species.
And he would attack anything that fell in the water, even a giant Tyrannosaurus rex.
While their food would not have surprised us, the dishes were unusual, to say the least, including wilds, peacocks, snails, and one of the rodents known as the peanut butterfly.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on their stools, the rich had banquets where they ate and slept.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not incorporate foods that were later brought to Europe from America or Asia.
They didn't have potatoes, or tomatoes, or corn, or cocoa, to be specific, and no ancient Roman ever had a chance to taste a turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple, which was considered the home of their gods.
The worshipers offered sacrifices to their deities, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs by celebrating various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own open courtyard and sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
In some cases, the temples were built with special towers, known as zircons, which resembled pyramids.
The top of the tower was a special beacon dedicated to a god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house was of little importance.
For the most part, the Jewish family lived outdoors.
Women cooked outside, shops were just open shelves facing the street, houses were built in stone.
Canaan lacked large forests, so the wood was very valuable.
Greenland was not densely populated, and according to the Scandinavian sagas, Erik Rudd was expelled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he came upon Greenland, which he called "The Green Land".
But before its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you've seen the movie Treasure Island, you might think the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
But it's not true, and even if it does say something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, reads: "Original version of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776". The reverse is at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but what is known is that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for preservation early in its existence.
So it's entirely possible that it was added there as a memorial.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was under the control of the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragons began, the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the "Free France" forces liberated the southern French territories in just two weeks, and then moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people working together and living in a society.
The term civilization comes from the Latin civilis, i.e., "citizen", which is similar in meaning to the Latin civis, "citizen", and civitas, "city", or "city-state", which in turn tell us something about the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, uniform distribution, and a sustainable cultural footprint.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, as they disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, which included only Congress.
Congress had no power to tax, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on government agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce all laws.
Furthermore, it lacked the authority to override state-imposed tax laws and tariffs.
The Confederation Treaty required that all amendments be approved unanimously by all the states, and the states were so disengaged with the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national team, is the second-most powerful national team in the world.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing are among the sports that are popular here.
The most popular winter sports are in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the island of Honshu. This makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipel" in terms of geography, as it is a cluster or group of islands.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as Farmosa, which meant "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive bakery practices, hiring Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized western and northern Taiwan in 1683 and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which granted Japan sovereignty over the island, and the latter governed Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main sites: the Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
To give visitors a better idea of how most of the buildings on the edge of the complex originally looked, the last ones were rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
The most popular format for still photographs is the 35 mm format. In the analog era, this format of film predominated.
This is the film that is being made today, but more importantly, the width-to-height ratio of this film is now used in the matrix formats of digital cameras.
It may sound a bit confusing, but in fact, a 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Accordingly, the aspect ratio for this format (after division by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of integers) is considered to be  3:2.
Many common formats have the same or similar aspect ratios (for example, the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often attacked and ridiculed, is a simple rule that provides momentum while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
If he is to be believed, the best place for the placement of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph into vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
This was a period in European history that saw the rise of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that may have existed, Christianity united European countries for over a thousand years.
All  from the king to the common man  were under her all-pervading rule.
The essence of one of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate misery and to alleviate suffering, and that is what the church's money is for.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this doctrine has been upheld.
The United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
Embargoes on vital goods for military and civilian use, though in violation of generally accepted international law, and enacted at the legislative level by several international agreements over the past two centuries, have proven to be an effective strategy.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent certain areas of the ocean from being accessed, exposing even neutral ships to danger.
Since there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany thought that it would not be used for unlimited underwater military operations either.
Among most citizens and countries during the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
States and peoples were determined to avoid a similar situation in the future, having already witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
A mere 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Baechler (his previous manager) were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
In ancient China, there were unique ways of defining different periods, and each period of Chinese history, or each ruling family, had its own distinct dynasty.
Dynastic periods were also divided into periods of separate provinces and periods of instability, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many of the nobles vying for the throne fought ruthlessly among themselves.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was during the Three Kingdoms period, when thousands of people died fighting for the top spot in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them  the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism and the belief that the country belongs not to a single ruler, but to the whole people.
Furthermore, the post-Revolution jobs were opened to all male candidates, pushing the most successful and ambitious to the top.
The same thing happened in the army, because if earlier the military ranks were assigned, based on the class, now on the basis of skills and skills.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
He was deeply interested in matters that went beyond the worldly life, and often visited the cave on Mount Noor (translated as light), known as Hira, to meditate and reflect.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, provides a very vivid insight into the spiritual foundations of Mohammed.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world  it is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if those who know about it know it exists, because inside a cave, you're completely isolated.
There's nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World to have survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids built to honor the memory of the Pharaoh, and was built in the third century BC.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The symbol for the bow upwards looks like V, and downwards  as a comma or square without a bottom.
"Upward bow" means you start at the end of the bow and go upwards, and "downward bow" means you start at the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and go downwards.
Moving the consonant upwards usually produces a softer sound, and downwards a stronger and more confident one.
You can put your badges in pencils, but remember that the printed symbols of the bow are there for a musical purpose, so they usually need to be preserved.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se), and Madame Elisabeth, the King's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris because of the crowd of women in the market.
The royal family were driven to Paris by carriage, and were surrounded by a mob of whistling, wailing, and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the windows of the carriage under the influence of the crowd.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved to the Queen, already terrified to death, the head of the guardian of Versailles.
The military costs of the US imperialists, which were incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines, had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the cost and interest on the bonds that were placed through the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would be the surplus profits brought by the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand what the Templars were, one must understand what became the prerequisites for the Order's creation.
The period in which these events occurred is traditionally called the Classical Middle Ages, a period in European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, the latter generally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" is understood to mean a range of practical ideas, from the push to advance a particular technology or technical necessity to the clear understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based, and their embodying in the field of technology.
Two general ideas are characteristic of most explanations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, makes a property of only it (rather than socially determined) influence on society.
In particular, there is an assumption that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide network of highways is not economically viable, and new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
So many people owning cars, and that's why the number of road accidents is increasing, and that's leading to new medical technologies that can be used to treat all kinds of injuries.
A large element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When we talk about the Romantic era, people were heavily influenced by the geography of presence, and as time went by, the traditions and culture that came with it were better than arbitrary laws, because they were in harmony with the place and the position that the community occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gained prominence as an epicenter of luxury and retained this status until about 1100 AD.
By the 12th century, its status as a capital of luxury had declined, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts, including spices and silk, valued much higher than what was offered in Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople ceded the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The Gothic style had its heyday between the 10th and 11th centuries, and also in the 14th century.
The first strong influence on the style of clothing was the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style in the late Middle Ages, and the Crusades' use of buttons to fasten clothing was one of the biggest events of the time.
Natural farming produces enough food to meet the unique needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple and generally organic system based on the use of a specific ecological region's natural preserved seeds, combined with seeding or other simple methods, to maximize yields.
Many farmers historically used organic farming, and many developing countries still do.
Subcultures are what brings together like-minded people who feel excluded by social norms, and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
The age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members may be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a particular subculture may be based on various factors  linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination thereof.
Members of the same subculture often identify their belonging to it through distinctive and symbolic styles of dress, mannerisms, and jargon.
To illustrate what socialization is and how important it is, the most common example is of children who were not fortunate enough to grow up in a climate of neglect, neglect, mistreatment, humiliation and abuse and who were not socialized by adults as children.
Some "wild" children have been in custody for long periods of time (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care has been due to the parents' unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual disabilities or shortcomings in the child.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, the children who were taken could have suffered severe abuse or trauma.
Others were said to have been raised by animals, and some were said to have been left to fend for themselves in the wild.
If a child is completely raised by animals, its behavior is almost entirely (including physical limitations) reflective of the behavior of the animal-nurse: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
While the whole purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a way to help people to get new learning experiences, whether it's using a new software or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual, for example, a teacher and a little plug-in in the Microsoft Office program are assistants.
The software includes virtual assistants to ask questions, give clues, and explain procedures that the student or listener may find difficult to handle on their own.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, from abuse and neglect to coercion.
We can't have kids growing up in an environment where they're not cared for, nurtured, and educated, and yet this happens.
And we think that foster care is a safe zone for these kids.
The assumption is that our foster care system will provide good health care, safe homes, loving and caring caregivers, and a stable education.
It is believed that the foster family should provide for the needs of the child that were not met in the home from which the child was taken.
The Internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also interpersonal communication.
Due to the peculiar characteristics of the Internet are additional opportunities for its use and meeting the needs of the audience.
For example, it is thought that concepts such as education and socialization are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified by Aimee and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in their study of audience response to Internet sites.
The video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  implying movements of the facial muscles that last only a few milliseconds.
It's been argued that the correct interpretation of micro-expressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks noted how images of people with brain damage, without understanding the speech itself, can nevertheless accurately appreciate sincerity.
He even suggests that animals -- domestic dogs, for example -- may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
20th-century research suggested that there are two main sources of genetic variation, namely, overt and latent variation.
Mutation creates new variations, and selection removes them from the pool of variants.
With each succeeding generation, segregation and recombination intersperse variations within these two pools.
In the savannah, the plant resources available to primates with digestive systems similar to those of humans cannot meet the amino acid needs.
And when they fail to do so, the consequences are dire, including malnutrition, stunted growth, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resource was proteins, which were found in legumes and leaves, but if not properly cooked, proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) provide a high protein content, rich in all the necessary amino acids, and are easily digestible.
So it should not be surprising to find that our ancestors solved their own protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate awakening of a sleeping person during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
One way to do that is to have a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up, but not quite.
If you find yourself shifting the watch in your sleep, try to put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants based on biorhythms, before going to bed it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic)  this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the stress of his body and spirit.
The lower the tension the more positive the life force is.
The only thing that's stopping us from achieving enlightenment is our own negativity and tension.
At the core of Tibetan Buddhism lies the teachings of the Buddha, which have been supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and a number of methods from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it combines meditation, Kundalini yoga and love of all humanity.
Kundalini yoga followers claim that to awaken the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment), one must practice certain yoga poses, mantras and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a central part of Tibetan meditation practice, where the visualization of various gods cleanses energy channels, opens chakras, and brings enlightened awareness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to the Soviet Union and the United States becoming allies. After the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins, with former allies turning into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really was between the armies of friendly countries, and the battlefields were in different regions from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by 17 September 1939.[citation needed] The retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in a single night, these plans lost their meaning, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers as part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Cargo shipment is clearly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of a navy was to ensure that their country was able to outflow people and goods, and at the same time prevent the enemy from outflowing its own people and goods.
The North Atlantic Campaign of World War II was one of the most significant examples of this idea, where the Americans tried to move people and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the movement, using mainly submarines.
Germany could probably have conquered Britain in the same way it had conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to ensure that they had milk, wool, meat, and skin at their disposal.
The domestic goats were generally kept in herds, which roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often looked after by Cossacks (children or teenagers) who acted as herdsmen.
As early as the 16th century, paved roads were built in England.
Although the gravel roads were just parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to move faster and pull heavier loads than on existing rough roads.
Rails were used to hold tracks in place early on, but it soon became apparent that rail traffic would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron, wooden wagon wheels were worn out more quickly.
The first all-metal railways appeared in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was the walking stick, and two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means "man walking", humans started to walk upright.
The Australopithecus, their predecessors, did not generally walk straight.
The Australopithecus was found to be able to walk in rocks between 4.2 and 3.9 million years old, but it is possible that seven million years ago, the sahelanthrops were already walking on two legs.
You can be more environmentally conscious, you can be part of the environmental movement, you can even be an activist, so that in the future, this kind of misery doesn't become so prevalent.
Often, this looks more like a symptomatic treatment, but when we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It's pretty obvious that the world has changed dramatically because of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the over-population and wasteful lifestyle of people has increased the number of problems.
After the July 4th Declaration was adopted by Congress, its handwritten copy, signed by Congress Chairman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was delivered to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
That night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as the "Arusha Dunlap".
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one copy, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as the Dunlap broadsides) have survived, although the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and may even still exist today, only we call them birds.
Many people dismiss these creatures as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
But birds still share many of the same traits as dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs, and, like the T. rex, they walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers are based on binary information.
A binary number can have any of the two values  0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs, for example, vomiting is a common symptom, making it difficult to diagnose immediately.
The first indication of internal poisoning is an open container of tablets or toxic household chemicals.
Emergency medical instructions for this particular poison need to be found on the label.
Entomologists use the term klop in the formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term "bed bug" comes from the fact that bed bugs have long been known to be the insects most adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the chewing and the bed-wetting are nest-dwelling parasites, having become accustomed to living in nests or in the home of their host.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States alone, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
The study found that women were twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a new baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of the child they already have.
They may give their child up for adoption.
Adoption is where the child's biological parents renounce their parental rights to allow other spouses to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and in fact, most scientific research is done using this method.
But there's more: an experiment is a test to rule out one or more possible hypotheses with questions and observations.
The classical texts were the focus of philosophers and naturalists, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were considered generally accepted at the time.
As the number of people who spoke Greek declined, the West found itself torn away from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many of the biorhythms we observe in animal behavior and physiology are largely dependent on endogenous cycles, which are the result of the biological clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have been documented to have periodic rhythms that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is an autonomous process that, even when no external signals are received, the process is said to continue as independent free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was tested in the Hershey and Chase experiment.
What Hershey and Chase did was use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments that either labeled the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or labeled the bacteriophage's sulfur protein.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material in which the mutation occurs, and whether the cells affected are germline cells, mutations can have a wide variety of effects.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be inherited, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who have an interest in visiting different natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the overall view and landscape, including, enjoy observing flora and fauna.
Examples of things to do in nature are fishing, hunting, bird watching, going to parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visiting, studying, and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People leave their cars every morning from small provincial towns to go to work, and other people pass them on the road, people who work in the place they left.
In this dynamic transportation loop, everyone is contributing to the private car-based transportation system in some way.
The scientific evidence suggests that today's high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to human evolution over the last two million years.
Transport systems are used by all the people who are involved in society, and almost all of them are unhappy with our transportation systems.
You don't hear so many complaints in developed countries about collapsing bridges or the quality of water.
Why is the transportation system so frequently the subject of these complaints, why do they break down so often, is it because transportation engineers are not competent enough, or is there something more important going on?
The concept of transport movement implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows presents a difficult problem because it's impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, tend to be quite sequential; so, traffic flows tend to have a rationally determined sequence, and can be approximated by mathematical models.
To more fully and qualitatively show what the movement of a vehicle is, it has been established how its three basic parameters are related to each other: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections help in planning and designing road facilities as well as in operating them.
The first animals to take to the air were insects, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more effectively, and find mates and food.
In most cases, the insects' wings fold along the body.
So this allows them to have a lot of small spaces to hide from predators.
Ostriches and dayflies are the only insects that can't fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus, a few thousand years ago, argued that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed that he was right, but many others thought otherwise  that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
Sounds reasonable, because it's hard to say from Earth that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the largest, with a volume of water eight times that of the second largest river.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that enters the oceans from the world's rivers.
The Amazon River, which is fed by thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids have never been surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments built by their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of only about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populated.
The Vatican's official language is Italian.
Most of those working in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All residents of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Because the basic chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) occur naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools, people have known about them since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that any matter is composed of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he theorized that these could transform into other substances and eventually become what we see.
In most cases, alloy  is a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
In addition, there are alloys that have a small amount of non-metallic components, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles, like atoms.
Atoms are so small that the dot at the end of this sentence contains trillions of them.
As a result, when the pencil first appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil's importance and frequency of use declined as new writing methods emerged.
People are writing messages on their computer screens, but no one needs a keyboard.
We can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard when it is replaced by something completely new.
A plutonium bomb uses the energy of nuclear fusion to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a very heavy cart on top of the other, and then splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no external interference.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side about 100 km.
The moon is thinner under the lunar clouds, and thicker under the highland .
Lunar seas may be more on the side of the moon nearer to us, because the crust is thinner there, and, accordingly, it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are all about what drives people or what attracts them.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they turn inward and give a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during adulthood.
These are all theories about what makes people want to do what they do and what factors in their environment might influence whether they'll do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are two authoritative content theories.
Basically, when executives lead their former colleagues, there are two kinds of behavior that can occur: On one end of the spectrum, there's trying to stay "your boyfriend" (or "your girlfriend").
Managers of this type may have difficulty assessing work efficiency, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, allocating responsibility, and holding accountable those responsible.
The other extreme is when the individual is driven beyond recognition -- they feel the need to dismiss everything the team has done so far and take it upon themselves.
Ultimately, the responsibility for the success or failure of the team rests with the leader.
It's not uncommon for this type of behavior to end up in arguments between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence for real teams apply to virtual teams, but there are some differences.
Usually virtual team members act as contact centers for the relevant real-world group.
Given that such teams can meet outside of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may be confusing for local leadership.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team  is the presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The management team that each member of the team reports to is called the "invisible team", and it sets the standards for each member.
Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can come from the way that functional departments in an organization use all the available resources efficiently.
So the process that an organization uses when people work together to overcome a problem can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
The management of an organization must create a culture that is characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning, because only then can an organization be called innovative.
In Engel (2006), the continental approach is a method by which organizations can achieve greater efficiency.
Theoretical approaches to the study of cognition are backed by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data, and therefore narrowing the field of study to a narrower and more specific area.
The research that we received from the researchers supports the idea of a strong correlation between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It's been known for a long time that various types of traumatic brain injuries, concussions, fractures, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter some of the mental functions.
The development of new technologies is making it possible to study the brain's structure and processes that were previously unknown to us.
This gives us a huge amount of data and material to build simulations that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While the term "artificial intelligence" is commonly associated with science fiction, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the study of the behavior, learning and intellectual adaptation of computers.
Artificial intelligence research involves trying to get machines to automate tasks that are necessary for machines to behave intelligently.
Examples include planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical problems, and the ability to recognize faces, voices, and handwriting.
They've broken into their own separate disciplines, which are real-life problems that they study and offer solutions to.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is a software component of some computer programs and video games.
Excursions are a big part of school education. Often, teachers take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Today, technology can be used to organize virtual tours, allowing students to visit museums, aquariums, and art galleries without leaving the classroom.
Taking virtual field trips together is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share lessons for future classes.
The Bennett High School students in North Carolina, for example, every year they put up a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year they re-do it, but they keep the old version on the web as an album.
In addition, blogging can improve students' written language, and while they may have some "difficulties" with grammar and spelling at the beginning of blogging, this is usually turned around for the better by having an audience.
Given that students are usually the most teasing audience, a blogger, to avoid criticism, does everything to improve his style.
In addition, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them". The need to keep their audience curious inspires them and forces them to remain competent and curious (Tota, 2004).
Blogging promotes collaboration and gives students a greater incentive to learn than the traditional school curriculum.
If students use blogs properly, they will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; actively responding to online materials will help students to articulate their own position to what is written by other people, as well as to express their own views on particular problems (Oroets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating and bilingual capital, with its many art galleries and museums, providing an opportunity to learn about the country's past and its present.
The Niagara Falls lie further to the south, and to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its unspoilt natural beauty.
For this reason, and many others, tourists, visitors, and other outsiders often see Ontario as a typical Canadian province.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost completely deserted.
And the population is represented by a fact that surprises many people: the number of African-Americans in the United States is greater than the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located off the east coast of Africa and are part of the Indian Ocean archipelago.
Madagascar is by far the largest of the three, and it's like a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states or part of France, and are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it quickly spread to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, marks the beginning of European influence and colonialism.
The northern boundary of this region is the Sahel, while the southern and western boundaries are the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women-tourists are always encouraged to say they are married, even if they are not.
In addition, it may be helpful to wear a ring (one that does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, they may be exposed to behaviors that are more likely to be abusive, such as being harassed by tourists, holding hands, and so on.
Be bold in your denial and speak out your opinion (even though it's culturally unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the 1755 earthquake, they abandoned this place.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city and renamed it Dar el-Badj. The name Casablanca was given to the city by the Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping.
Near the Old City of Medina, one can quite quickly find places where traders sell traditional Moroccan products  leather goods, pottery, tajin, necklaces and various toys, but all of them are exclusively for tourists.
Goma  is a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma was hit by the eruption of the Niiragonga volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, mainly in the city center.
Although Goma is safe enough to visit, it is worthwhile to do a little research to find out if there are any hostilities in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Mount Nyiragongo volcano, and offers very cheap services for mountain gorilla viewing enthusiasts - more attractive prices in Africa are hard to find.
To get around Goa, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) with a standard (local) price of about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
As a result of the relative inaccessibility of Tambuktu, its name came to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport, Timbuktu is today a city of the poor.
In 1990, because of the threat of desert sands, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates gave much attention to the city in the PBS program "The Heart of the African Continent".
Compared to the rest of the country, it is even more distinctive because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is a national park in the north-eastern part of South Africa, bordered on the east by Mozambique, on the north by Zimbabwe, and by the Krakadilly River, which forms its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and has 14 ecozones, each of which is home to different animals and plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country, and is also considered the most significant of the National Parks of South Africa.
As with all South African national parks, the park charges daily admission fees and an environmental levy.
In addition, it may be beneficial to purchase a so-called Wild Card  subscription, which gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all of the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong is borrowed from the island of Hong Kong, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings, shaping the city's architectural face, have been compared to a glittering pillar diagram, and Victoria's waterfront harbors only accentuate its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong are found when you leave the island and head for the Kowloon pier opposite.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on drylands.
In the past, this place was taken over by colonists from Great Britain, so if you want to see the evidence of the country's colonial past, start here.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) off the coast of Bangladesh and into the interior of India.
The Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is the only national park in India that is not part of any national park.
It's not just the mangrove swamps that are called forests, it's some of the last of the barren jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain and still remain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and currently, an estimated 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are found in the region.
From the inter-district bus station (which is across the river) buses depart throughout the day, however, most depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and into Jakarta (which is in the Boomtang district).
Due to the fact that inter-district buses are often crowded, tickets are recommended to be purchased a few days before the trip.
Comfortable and reliable small buses from Japan serve most areas.
A taxi is a convenient and comfortable way to reach places nearby, such as the cities of Punakha (travel cost  200 nawt) and Paro (travel cost  150 nawt).
The bridge spanning the Ayapock is a freight bridge that connects the banks of the Ayapock River, which is the dividing line between the two towns of Ayapock (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-Luaipoux (French Guiana).
The bridge is divided into two lanes, each with a width of 3.50 m.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017, despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaran√≠, who led the life of the wolf hunters and also practiced natural agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people who inhabited the territory of modern Eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Paihua and the Guaicuru, lived in the Chaco region, and they relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering to survive.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Gigantic Province of India", actually came into being in the 16th century when Spanish conquistadors encountered the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its identity and identity since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo courts of Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here.
Information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal to the British Pound (GBP).
Currencies in the Falkland Islands can only be exchanged at the country's only bank, located in Port Stanley opposite the EFCI West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted for payment anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are commonly accepted in Stanley itself.
Remote islands probably won't accept credit cards, but they might accept British or American cash, so ask the owners for their payment method in advance.
It's virtually impossible to exchange the local currency outside the Falklands, so make sure to do so before you leave.
The reason is that Montevideo is south of the equator, whereas in the northern hemisphere it is winter and in the southern hemisphere it is summer.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30¬∞C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold, with the thermometer rarely dropping below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes the temperature feel lower than it is.
The rainfall is almost constant throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people and don't need to be fed or disturbed, wild animals remain wild.
The park advises keeping at least 100 yards (meters) away from bears and wolves and  25 yards (meters) from other wild animals!
Horses, deer, roe deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack, no matter how obedient they may seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because of the lack of proper distancing, and you should stay away because these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Bear and other wildlife are also attracted by their scent, so avoid spicy food and maintain a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city of just under 40,000 people is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889 the harbor became the site of a notorious naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
The assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamase Lealofi III ended a peaceful rally in the city, which had been held during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
Because of the harbors on both sides of Auckland, there are a lot of beaches, and the most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches are located near North Harbor, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south along the Pacific coast.
Most of the beaches are sandy, safe places to swim, and most have shade from half-a-dozen trees.
The elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier (the central district of Auckland) in the Waitemata Harbour are home to the Tamaki Drive beaches.
It's another crowded family beach with lots of shops.
The main local variety of beer is known to consumers as Number one, a simple but pleasant and refreshing drink.
French wines are available, but Australian and New Zealand wines are preferred.
The local tap water is absolutely safe and drinkable, but if you have a few precautions, finding bottled water is not a problem.
The idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. An espresso is a small portion of black coffee, cappuccino is filled with cream rather than foam, and tea is brewed without milk.
The hot chocolate is exactly like the Belgian ones. Fruit juices cost quite a lot, but they taste great.
Reef trips are available year-round and in large numbers, but injuries from any of these causes are rare.
We still recommend that you follow the authorities' advice, follow all the requirements and follow the safety warnings carefully.
The Cuban jellyfish are found from October to April near the beaches and near the river banks north of the settlement of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people, and most shark avoid people and swim away from them.
Cretaceous crocodiles are not found in the ocean, but primarily in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance lets the traveler worry about having a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, but you may be able to book accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Typically, travel agents offer service packages that include breakfast, airport transfers and even combined flight and hotel packages.
Also, if you need time to consider the offer or obtain any other documents (such as a visa) that are necessary to get to your destination, the travel agent can hold your reservation.
It is recommended that you send your suggestions for changes to the terms or inquiries to the travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of people who go to a music festival choose to stay, and most people think it's a tremendously rewarding experience.
You'll have to come early if you want to find a camping spot next to the music venue.
Remember, even if the main stage is gone, there may still be sections of the festival that are still playing music after midnight.
Families with small children can use special campsites at some festivals.
We recommend checking the location of your cabin when you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter  crossing the Illyrians can be accompanied by a terrible noise and crackling, which is especially sensitive to people with sensory sensitivity.
The cruise program to St. Petersburg includes a stay in the city, and the passengers of these cruises do not need a visa (see conditions).
Usually, a casino makes an effort to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, but there are no windows or clocks, and it is difficult to find exits.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment programs, all of which are designed to keep guests in a good mood and keep them wanting to leave the casino.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are provided for a fee, but all the great players know the importance of sobriety, since intoxication interferes with the ability to think clearly.
Snow, hail, and sub-zero temperatures are all factors that anyone considering a visit to the northern latitudes or a crossing of the mountain passes must take into account.
The coefficient of adhesion on snow-covered and ice-covered roads is low, so you can't drive like the carriages are just asphalt.

Perhaps the most popular tourist activity in Africa is safari, and for many tourists, it's the most exciting part of the trip.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a dry-land journey, particularly through the savannah, where one can see the beautiful wild African environment.
As a rule, individual animals, including giraffes and elephants, come close to cars, and even standard equipment can ensure good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are best seen through binoculars, because they can be very cautious.
The hike, which takes several hours or even days, is called a "walking safari", also known as a "shrub safari", "walking safari", or "footing".

If you have little experience driving on city roads, be careful: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes for traffic and unexpected turns.
The existing speed limits here are noticeably lower than the previous and subsequent sections  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is very important to adhere to them rigidly.
Interesting fact: the cell signal is stronger here than along many other sections of the trail, like near the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
The pastries in Germany are quite good, and in Bavaria, like in its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite rich and varied.

The stroms hang from either side of the saddle and are the supports for the rider's feet.
They give the rider more stability, but can cause safety problems because the rider's legs can get stuck.
If the rider falls off the horse, his foot may grab onto the stirrup. In this case, if the horse starts to run off, he may pull the rider along. To minimize the risk of this, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, the special shoes with high heels and soft, rather narrow soles worn by most riders.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety loop, which allows the rider to fall off the saddle by pulling the saddle belt back.

Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to several countries means that tourists and travelers have to pass through passport control and visa applications repeatedly.
But the Schengen area functions as one country in this respect.

So if you already have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen country, which saves time, money and simplifies the paperwork.
There is no universal definition of an antique, and some tax authorities classify goods as antiques if they are over 100 years old.

The reverse flow is concentrated in several areas with a large depth, which is due to the underwater topology, and there is possible formation of a fast current to a large depth.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion as people try to swim back upstream, which may or may not be possible.
Once you're out of the flow, it's pretty easy to swim back.
Try to steer your way in a way that doesn't get you back in the flow, or if your skills allow it, or if you've been spotted, you can stay in place and wait for rescue.
Because of the shorter honeymoon phase, the shock of returning home can come earlier than the culture shock, and it can be more severe and last longer.
For travelers who have not had a cultural adjustment, it can be very difficult to adjust to the culture of their homeland.
People who return home after spending a long time abroad have already become accustomed to the culture of the new country and they have lost some of the habits that they had in their native culture.

Finland is one of the best places to rowing or to go boating, and the country has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You may not need a yacht to navigate lakes and archipelagos.
While the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide a very different experience.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime, and statistically, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
Similar results are seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but nowhere else (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).

It's not about being ashamed of it, it's just a fear that's like other personal fears or aversions to certain things that many people have.
Some may find it helpful to overcome the fear of the unknown or the fear of losing control of the aircraft by understanding how planes are designed and what happens when they fly.

The obvious way to get to first or business class is to pay a hefty fee for the privilege (or better yet, have a company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: practice shows that compared to a normal economy class, you can pay four times more than business class and more than eleven times for first class!
