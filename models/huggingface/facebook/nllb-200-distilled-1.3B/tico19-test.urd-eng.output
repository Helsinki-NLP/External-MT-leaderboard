The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased sharply between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The overall spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK shows similar trends, with the global COVID-19 epidemic in all countries accelerating at different stages depending on the country.
Based on Italy's experience, hospital and intensive care units in several countries should increase their preparedness due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they will require care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a large number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent is the novel coronavirus now known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, namely pneumonia with or without a respiratory tract infection, and most of them recover.
14% of cases of COVID-19 occur in the form of more severe illness, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of cases involving severe illness require intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the recent number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread further geographically, and the dynamics of the global COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world are currently country-specific.
COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of EuroSurveillance, Spiritry et al reported the first European confirmed cases of COVID-19 as defined by the WHO case definition.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported by three French people who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to date, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining aggregate data on COVID-19 cases and overall prevalence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) receives data on COVID-19 cases in every country worldwide only from official sources, the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO daily at 8:00 a.m. update.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to Italy.
As for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day intermittent overall spread of COVID-19 taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We presented the total reported cases for each country as of 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The overall 14-day intermittent overall spread of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK is generally consistent with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom as a whole, the overall prevalence of COVID-19 began to increase on 21 February and then accelerated on 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported mostly from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has shown similarly increasing trends (Appendix).
Figure 2 shows the total number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, compared with Italy, during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlighted that, as of 15 March at 8:00 am, the total number of cases had been reported earlier in the EU/EEA and the UK than in Italy, in just 3 weeks or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The observed trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 suggest that this global pandemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
Despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses and different definitions of potential cases and protocols for selecting patients, including catch-up testing, are needed to confirm COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation where ca 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to any hospital and/or intensive care unit are available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (figures are not shown).
However, recent surveillance data, including the number of reported cases and deaths, should be collected in a systematic manner to complement them.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that in Europe there was a major change in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds from 29.2 per 100,000 population in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that these countries would have roughly the resources of Italy (11 to 2010 with 12.5 ICU and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population).
Modelling scenarios for healthcare capacity increases, estimates of COVID-19 hospitalization cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK associated with a >90% risk of ICU bed capacity overcrowding, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Concern Assessment on COVID-19.
Since there are clusters of cases in EU/EEA countries and specific regions of the UK so far, and hospitals and intensive care units generally define the population of the regional region, the priority data for information on cases and intensive care beds 2 (NUTS-2) facilitate the available numbering of regional units.
The situation in Italy and current trends in other countries show that the global COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must prepare for ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the surge in COVID-19 cases, such as in the affected areas of Italy, requires healthcare that is particularly intensive.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Concern Assessment, which identified a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, suggested, with a shift from a prevention to mitigation approach, if not implemented early, the anticipated rapid increase in case numbers may not provide enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, recognize and adapt their response.
The Rapid Alert Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries are likely to further increase their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare workers.
Failing this, it is likely that healthcare providers in EU/EEA countries will face an acute care need due to an increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, with devastating consequences for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread by bats and cause the same symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but it affects older people more than young people and women more than men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand and eradicate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable reminder for all Chinese due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, which forced all holidaymakers to stay at home for several weeks.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease named CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 deaths as a result of the virus.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "the public enemy number 1" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, causes, treatment and diagnosis since its first report on 7 January 2020 and which has determined the isolation of a number of patients.
This review attempts to summarize the creative developments in the new and rapidly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS outbreak in 2012).
We'll talk about what we've learned so far about diagnosing and preventing this disease, as well as some key questions that remain.
For humans, CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens, mainly causing about 15% of common STDs.
However, in this century, we have two very deadly CoVs, SARS CoV and MERS-CoV, that caused epidemics in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon this terrible disease spread to many other countries with its death rate.
So the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, the pneumonia cluster in Figure 1,1, of unknown origin, was first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infection was reported among healthcare workers, meaning it is possible to transmit from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan was locked down, shutting down all public transportation in the city.
The first clinical study of the disease, published on 24 January, reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the source of the infection from an unknown source of animals.
On 30 January, WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report came out, the disease had already spread throughout China and to about 50 countries around the world (Fig. 2.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
Another updated description of the outbreak was described in the Zell-list in a multidisciplinary study on 8,866 patients on February 11, 2020, including 4,021 confirmed patients with COVID-19 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, very few under 20 years old and only 14 infected under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread in Hubei and its surrounding areas.
The average COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 (9-2) days from onset.
The average growth period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased rapidly before June 23, 2020, according to the mass transit time ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The patient mortality rate of confirmed cases was 1.44% (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (men), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and enveloped subfamily of viruses, which contain a component of the sensory RNA complex.
They are divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The membrane spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
Release the viral genome into cytoplasm, then after copying the viral genome, make a version encased in genetic RNA containing glycolipids and nucleic acid, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
A new strain of SARS-CoV-2 beta was genetically identified in 10 samples collected from the origin of the outbreak associated with the Huang Seafood Market in Wuhan, with a prevalence of 99.98%.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to transfer electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found on the extremely narrow portion of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S strain of SARS-CoV-2 is more weakly linked to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-A, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV causes fewer infections than SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a noval short membrane encoded by orf3b and a secretory membrane encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and may express itself in IFNB, however there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On 18 February 2020, Zhao et al., reported complex resolution in EM structures along the full length of human ACE2 at 2.9 Å islets with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which combined open and closed mutations as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-linkages, which identify CoVs and provide evidence of infection.
B0AT1 may be a treatment for drug screening in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
And the original representative of the world
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both originating from bats, have been transmitted to humans through civet cats and camels.
By comparing the bat to other SARS-CoV-2s, the bat is considered a local representative of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% similar to the two SARS-like CoVs of bats Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, it is not yet known which intermediate agent helped to cross the barriers to infecting humans, and the route of transmission cannot yet be explained.
J, Y, L, had proposed snakes as pathogens of viruses from bats to humans involving the repair of homologous within S proteins.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China have suggested that 99% of the genes found in long-snouted pangolins, ant-eating mammals, and SARS-CoV-2, commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, may be potential intermediates for SARS-CoV-2 based on gender.
However, the 1% difference in the spread between the two genomes is still a huge difference, as well, pending final results from the comprehensive evidence.
Most of the physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which can survive for up to 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days in temperatures below 20 °C and humidity up to 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, and to heat of 56°C for 30 minutes, or 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fatty antibiotics, but chloroxide cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Thus, we can refer to past studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically when a host is attacked by a virus, the host's immune system recognizes the host through first-type receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NAD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
By various means, viral inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which restrict the spread of the virus and stimulate its antiviral genetics to accelerate micro-phage phagocytosis.
However, the N-terminus of SARS-CoV may help the virus to avoid an immune response.
Soon, a sympathetic immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphomas including CD4+ and CD8+ play important roles in cell defense.
+CD4 T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus and +CD8 T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cells to apoptosis.
Hormonal immunity including C3a and C5a and antibody replacement are essential to fight viral infection.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized by antibodies isolated from a recovered patient.
On the other hand, overuse of the immune system causes a lot of local free radicals that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, worst of all, stop many organs from working and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is characteristic of early clustering, and is more likely to affect older adults and pregnant women.
It is common in individuals who are infected with large numbers of viruses or whose immune systems are weakened, and those individuals are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is an average of 14-1 days, with a maximum of 7-3 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average growth period is 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study shows that the growth period based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is critical for health authorities to effectively schedule quarantine based on the most favorable growth period to prevent people from transmitting the virus from people who are infected but who do not have symptoms.
Generally, people with the virus or infected with it need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Often the main and initial symptom of COVID-19 is fever, accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, knee, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience shortness of breath and/or convulsions a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have immediate improvement in acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and freezing.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even against normal pulmonary imaging should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that 98% of patients with fever, 76% with dry cough, 55% with shortness of breath and 3% with diarrheal symptoms required ventilation support.
Two recent studies, both of which looked at the causes of a cluster cell disease, have found similar results for a cluster cell disease caused by a family cluster cell disease and a non-symptomatic person-to-person transmission.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that MERS-CoV patients also had primary symptoms of fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of these required ventilation assistance, much higher than COVID-19 patients and MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%), and sore throat (21%), were also reported in MERS patients.
It has been shown that fever (100-99%) dry cough (75-29%), shortness of breath (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and sore throat (25-13%) are the main symptoms in SARS patients, and about 20-14 percent of patients required ventilation support.
As of 14 February, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2% when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576.
In contrast, the mortality rate was 10% in 8,096 confirmed cases of SARS as of November 2002.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
An earlier study reported that the R0 reproduction count of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 reproduction range of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
This table 1.1 shows a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rates and reproductive numbers.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two viruses.
So, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
Clusters often start with a single family or a single gathering or ride, such as a cruise ship.
Often patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected persons or patients in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can retain the virus for up to two weeks without showing symptoms and patients who recover from hospital discharge may become infected again, prompting calls to extend the quarantine period.
These patients were found to have low or equal white blood cells at baseline (especially lymphitis).
For example, lymphedema including lymphocyte counts < 1×109/L in white blood cell counts < 4×109/L, and serum amino transfers and vermias were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and blood myoglobin, and most patients had elevated levels of C-inactivated lymph and atheroscytes.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer in the blood, the deficiency of pharabone, was increased, so the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The usual features against chest radiography of COVID-19 patients are a two-sided complex shadow in the lungs or a blurring on the ground glass.
Most patients develop common pneumonia, severe lung pain, severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Anxiety breathing syndrome, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid retention and increased fibrous gas exchange are largely compromised.
Inactivation of type I and type II pneumonitis reduces the level of head factor and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung outbreaks and their failure.
So, the worst chest X-ray results are parallel to the extreme extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 in patients with SARS and MERS-like and ARDS-like and viral infection pathology showed pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membrane, and penetration of median lymphocytes, and polycytic synesthesia cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease.
The use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the key criterion.
In China on 13 February 2020, due to the high rate of false negative, which can accelerate the epidemic, medical data for diagnosis (which no longer relies entirely on RT-PCR) was started.
A similar situation occurred with the SARS diagnosis.
So, for effective diagnosis, it's important to have a history, medical records, lab tests, and radiological results all together.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group outlined a protocol for using CRISPR-based Sherlock techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which would use a wide range of dipping sticks to detect RNA fragments of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 in less than an hour without the need for 20x10-18 microliters/liter to 200x10-18 microliters/liter (100-10 copies per microliter of input) devices.
Hopefully, if confirmed in clinical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, mainly therapists can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also trying different therapies that were previously prescribed or used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include recent and potential antiviral medications, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs, and perhaps in small amounts other organs that express ACE2, such as the stomach and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and lung failure are the greatest risk to the patient and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, to help with respiration to alleviate symptoms and save lives, depending on the severity of the disease, general oxygen, high-flow oxygen, uninterrupted ventilation and mechanical ventilation are included.
Patients with severe respiratory distress are assisted by exocorporeal oxygen membrane (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique to treat the risk of a fatal heart attack or respiratory failure.
Additionally, for electro-luminal care, treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septic shock are essential to protect critical organ functions in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is said that cytokine flow occurs in patients with SARS and MERS as a result of immune system overload.
Cytokine stroma is a type of systemic inflammatory response that is triggered by the release of a sequence of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines engage immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are a major cause of respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticoid steers and two-cysoma anti-IL6 molecular antibodies have been used to treat cytokine stroma.
Other cytokine-stroke immunosuppressant treatments included; blocking IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; suppressing kinase cell 4; and directed modification of immune response T-cell inhibitors, HADC.
The steroid was widely used as an immunosuppressant as a treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in SARS.
However, high doses of steroid were not beneficial in lung disease in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting diagnosis.
Nevertheless, the use of short courses of multiple doses of corticosteroids in severely ill patients with COVID-19 has been recommended with caution.
No effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, in a US patient with COVID-19 with the intravenous vaccine remetisovir, nucleotide anaesthesia was found to be effective.
Remitsovir is a novel antiviral drug, initially developed by Gilead to treat illnesses caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequently, remetovir was also identified as a potential blocker for other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided a mixture of it to China for a pair of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with results far exceeding expectations.
In addition, baricetinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/retinavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/retonavir may cause diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The interaction of this treatment with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from this infectious disease to treat other patients with the disease or to protect healthy people from the disease.
In fact, most recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) that help fight pathogenesis and other external factors through B lymphocytes and identify and directly neutralize unique molecules on the pathogen.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 and administered to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms such as inflammation and viral load and hypoxia improve within 24 hours.
However, no specific treatment has yet been developed, so it is important to confirm and define it before recommending its widespread use.
In addition, in order to see the effects of the treatment, some of the risks associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies increase the immune response, and can cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially lethal toxin.
The blood usually has a low antibody count, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies that quickly to fight a global pandemic.
Isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic code to encode effective antibodies to the virus' essential antigen is a delicate and difficult process.
So we can speed up the process of making antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula, which is based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine and depends on the diagnosis of a disease.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or ambiguous because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe stage.
For example, Zhou Fengjie Lu capsules and Li Huang Cheng Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.
Several provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), saw high rates of improvement in treatment of 87% of their patients using traditional Chinese medicine, while Hubei Province, which used traditional Chinese medicine in only 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%)
However, this is a fairly rigorous comparison, as the impact of this analysis must also include many other factors such as the number of patients and severity.
On February 18, 2020, Boley Zheng and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) treatment with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the Western medicine group plus traditional Chinese medicine group had abnormally less time than the Western medicine group alone needed to maintain body temperature, relieve symptoms, and stay in the hospital.
Most impressively, the symptomatically increasing (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate (8.8% versus 39%) was unusually low.
However, traditional Chinese medicine still needs better and controlled trials of its efficacy and safety on a larger scale and in more centers.
It would be interesting to highlight the mechanisms of the treatment process of traditional Chinese medicine, to explain their effective ingredients or if possible their combination.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are often fearful of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined individuals experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, convulsions, and cough, as well as corticosteroid-induced side effects of treatment such as insomnia, increased anxiety, and stress can occur.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients reported persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, depression, and suicide.
Contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health related to the COVID-19 pandemic can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, people who come into contact with them, as well as general public who need mental health care should be provided.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with constant and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and its treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to prevent transmission from infected animal colonies and susceptible populations, and antiviral treatments are often necessary to control emerging viral outbreaks.
Efforts have been made to develop S-Virus-based vaccines to produce long-lasting and vitally neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity against SARS.
Direct-acting vaccines were analyzed in animal samples for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting the elderly, lethal challenge samples and animals from viral infection cannot be determined before clinical studies can begin.
That's because SARS was out 17 years ago and there have been no new cases reported.
In contrast, MERS strains are still being eradicated in regions other than the Middle East where there are persistent sources of animal virus.
Vaccine strategies to prevent MERS using virus inactivation, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recovered serum subunits have been developed, and some of these have been tested on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is a challenge due to the long time frame (average 18 months) required for vaccine development and for the dynamic mutations of CoVs.
COVID-19, as a novel disease, has begun to show its medical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without any complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare agencies must build disease diagnostics models to prioritize their services in low-resource areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or infection of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affected people aged 65-30 years, with 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the above study being over 50 years old.
Patients with a higher risk of primary co-occurring complications require more intensive care, and are more likely to be older than those without such complications (average life expectancy of 66 years instead of 51 years), which presents age as a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000).
Inhibition and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are at risk of severe cardiovascular events.
Heart disease is also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to ACE2-positive cholinesterase, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory results: Blood levels of C-reactive plasma (CRP) reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been suggested as a potential analytical process for treatment response and eventual recovery of the disease.
The association of C-reactivated plasma levels has been suggested for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspirate aminotransferase (AST), ala-nine-amino-transferase (ALT), and creatine kinase may also help predict outcomes.
These chemicals are expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released through tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional target for heart or liver failure.
Critical clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporary improvement of clinical symptoms should be considered in combination with other tissues to predict outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroid immunosuppression is commonly used to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage as adjunctive therapy in infectious disease.
Since corticosteroid overdoses were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors developed avascular osteoncerosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, very low doses of steroid should be used for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients experienced unusual stress due to enduring prolonged quarantine and witnessing the untimely death of close family and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to relieve these patients of stress and return them to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies done so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can also enter the upper respiratory tract, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, and cause mild or no symptoms, similar to the common cold caused by other CoVs, in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, in the early stages or during the developmental period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which makes it very difficult to control the outbreak.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when the patient is severely ill, while early stage transmission is rare.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Currently in China, there are hopes and efforts to disrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission by locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities and keeping the entire population in constant quarantine.
While these measures are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, they are reducing the number of new cases, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most welcome thing is that the pandemic will end in March and its onset will be in three to four months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be a more contagious disease than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longhi et al., established a model to predict the outcome of a global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that mid-turbines and throat patches of patients who recovered from hospital 2 weeks ago showed they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be a circulatory factor for influenza.
However, based on the decrease in the number of new cases, there are promising signs in China, which indicate that the current strategy is working.
Ebola was originally predicted to have a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is vulnerable to infection and eventually becomes extinct or persists in humans like a low-pathogenic virus.
The following figure provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with virus-contaminated material.
The virus is also found in the feces, which creates a new possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were likely due to non-neurological infections, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those who come into contact with the sick or infected should be very careful.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a face mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series #1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces where they can reach others.
However, only N95 (serial #1860) masks can prevent the inhalation of viral particles as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viral particles fully penetrating.SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both at about 85 nm.
Even if five surgical masks are paired together, the particles can still penetrate them, so healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial #1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear isolation gowns to reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he had to wear an N95 mask; the virus probably entered through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare workers should wear transparent face shields or goggles when working with patients.
It is strongly advised for people in infected or potentially infected areas to wash their hands frequently with disinfectant soap, try to quarantine themselves indoors and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered an appropriate distance.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus in the human world, it is a high homologue of SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020, and should be a cause for high alert for China based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the directorate of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the novel virus is less transmissible from person to person and has limited reproductive capacity and that prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
The message significantly eased public alarm, especially as they prepared for the Spring Festival, and at least lost time in controlling the outbreak in Wuhan.
The Chinese disease control agencies may have learned from this hardship and made important improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be careful when making public announcements as every word matters to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be sensitive to and respond to clinic information rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or staff; (3) focus on controlling a potential outbreak, in its early stages, rather than giving the public relief; and (4) frequently increase public awareness of epidemics and use targeted and impactful exercises to test and improve society's response system over time.
The COVID-19 outbreak began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS re-emergence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more often than younger people and more men than women and has a higher severity and mortality rate in older people than younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have regular RNA negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Otherwise, recovered patients may become positive again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be addressed, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two beta SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
Who was the original representative, the bat, the intermediate species for the transmission of the virus to humans?
Without knowing the answer to # 1 and # 2, we cannot effectively slow down the transmission process and it can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to this ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without accurate answers to these questions, we cannot get fast and accurate diagnoses and effective treatments.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end like SARS, or will it continue to happen periodically like the flu?
This is important, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, no matter the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal.
Animal origin of human coronaviruses
Over millennia, mutations and adaptations, including humans, have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host organisms.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been shown to be devastating and life-threatening.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 once again brought CoVs to the forefront and its faster transmission and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV surprised us.
HCoV infection is an animal-to-human infection and serves us to understand the animal origin of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originated in bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Intermediate host organisms of some HCoVs are also known.
Identify animal hosts that have a direct impact on human disease prevention.
Investigating the CoV-host organism in animals leads to important awareness of the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we offer an overview of the current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as their animal origin and mixed-variety transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate between different HCoVs from the point of view of the evolution of different viruses and their genetic repair.
The current COVID-19 outbreak will be discussed in this context.
In addition, the implications of viral immunity on the requirements for successful host organism mutations and disease severity have been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of enveloped, positively charged, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which use large genome sizes like 26 to 32 kB between RNA viruses, were called "CoVs" because of the appearance of crown-like morphology from the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have undivided genes that share a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) stacked on top of each other, which translate into polymorphs of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polymerase processes another 16 non-structural polymers, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of genetics includes ORFs for structural fibers, including spindle (S), membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleus fibers (N).
A large number of specific-strand helper ligands are also encoded by different-strand CoVs.
Based on the difference in the fluid configurations, CoVs are classified into four genera ((alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV genus comprising most HCoVs and further divided into strands (A,B,C and D).
Phylo-genetic evidence showed that, for the most part, bats and rats are the source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while birds are the largest reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers and some of them have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 commonly cause symptoms such as a mild cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, which may cause lower respiratory tract infections with a relatively higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary embolism in more patients.
In the mid-1960s, a strain of HCoV-229E, B814, isolated nasal discharge from patients with a mild cold.
Since then, more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the notion was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is the most devastating in modern history, affecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a permanent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread around the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the coming global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs originated in animals such as bats, rats or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support that all HCoVs evolved from bats, where viruses are well adapted and exhibit non-pathogenic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Animal tracing of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, spread strength and restriction factors of transmissions across species.
This may also aid or guide in the detection of SARA-CoV-2 reservoirs, intermediates and host animals for breeding with important implications for preventing future reoccurrence.
In this review, we will review the pathogenetics of HCoVs from source animals, mixed-species transmission and transmission.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common idea that the parent viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts and become pathogenic after migration to their new host organism.
We also assess the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs, which often increases transmission with pathogenic degradation.
The consequences of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolated, nasal discharge of patients with a mild cold, HCoV-229E strain B814 isolated various animals infected with various CoVs including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was later adopted to grow into WI-38 lung cell lines.
Between 10 and 20 percent of patients infected with HCoV-229E have mild colds including headache, sneezing, restlessness and symptoms of sore throat with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from an organ culture and then inserted into the brain of small mice in a serial route.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of people who have HCoV-229E, which do not differ symptomatically from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were globally distributed, and they spread more in temperate climates during winter.
Generally, the growth time of both viruses is less than a week, after which the disease persists for about 2 weeks.
According to human voluntary studies, infection of healthy individuals with HCoV-229E causes a mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients show severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia", was the first well-documented global pandemic caused by HCoV in human history and is the SARS-CoV etological agent, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Zhuangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic that spread across many countries and continents resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a growth period of 4 to 7 days and a 10th day of disease at the viral load threshold, could increase by almost two secondary cases.
A patient infected with SARS-CoV initially has symptoms of muscle pain, headache, fever, restlessness and chills, followed by, shortness of breath, cough, and shortness of breath with delayed onset.
Uncommon laboratory tests for lymphadenia, SARS, and some elevated creatine kinases are rare in patients with abnormal liver function.
Disseminated alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage growth are also observed in SARS patients.
After that, about 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, several organs in addition to the lower respiratory tract, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can be affected, usually with cytokine stroma, which can be especially fatal in patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an index patient, who had traveled from Zhuangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCov-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands during late 2004.
It is initially found in young children, the elderly and in patients with weakened immune systems with respiratory disease.
Disease caused by HCoV-BL63 is commonly characterized by inflammation of the nasal mucosa, eye disorders, fever, and inflammation of the nasal passages.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 occurs in about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, and symptoms are severe in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with whooping cough, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong who was hospitalized due to pneumonia and inflammation of the nasal passages.
HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma distress, with community-acquired pneumonia and inflammation of the nasopharynx.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which cause mild respiratory illness, have been found worldwide.
These four community-derived HCoVs are very well compatible with humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic disease, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as a rare case of a more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63 that caused severe lower respiratory tract infection, recently reported in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit and persist within humans, they become low-potency pathogens or pathogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia who had severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Where most laboratory-confirmed cases are in the Middle East, and occasionally imported cases with secondary transmission in close contact are found in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015 a secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which has characteristics of advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, several MERS patients develop severe renal failure, which is very unique from MERS in HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, 34.4% of the more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases had resulted in deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses in humans.
During mid-to-late December 2019, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated pneumonia patients were last identified from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of global concern, naming the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of those treated dying.
Specifically, in Hubei, China, the death rate from these cases is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been reported in some patients.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia and it can exacerbate acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar due to the 82% consistent similarity in the upper nucleotide, they are a cluster of different branches of the pathological genetic tree.
The apparent SARS-CoV-2 virus is less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported symptoms of non-symptomatic subjects infected which may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and contrasts with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2 reveal many interesting similarities and differences.
First, HCoVs have very similarity in the duration and duration of disease progression.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the other four community-acquired (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has generally been observed to exhibit its infectious characteristics during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including unspecific, mild or no symptoms at all.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV infections, although this ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting characteristics similar to community-derived HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community acquired from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, as with cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it enters humans.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in waste samples, as can other HCoVs.
Although at least in some situations that future studies have yet to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in oral fecal transmissions, as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 will also show seasonal expression, like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 after entering humans, including transmission, pathogenesis and sustained spread, will affect the ultimate outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired HCoVs cause mild symptoms while adapting well in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, both strains may be survivors of a global epidemic of ancient HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that are susceptible to severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
To do this, HCoVs that can withstand the restriction of the host organism sufficiently and accumulate the desired mutation must replicate in humans.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people it affects, the more likely it is that humans will fully adopt it.
If it is well-administered, then it will be difficult to prevent transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the population, causing the common cold in immunocompromised individuals.
These viruses don't need animal stores.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and cannot be sustained in human transmission.
They need to grow and breed in their animal reserves, and potentially find an opportunity to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more intermediate and extended hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs.
At least at this time, it has a higher potential to transmit like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-derived HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if humans will fully adopt it and it will circulate in humans without any reservoirs or intermediate host animals.
Before discussing the origins of HCoVs, it would be best to discuss the evolution, nature, reservoirs, intermediate and extended determinants and characteristics of HCoVs host animals.
An animal, if it has a closely related ethnicity, acts as an evolutionary host organism for HCoVs, sharing a high degree of similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ethnovirus usually adapts well to the host organism and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the host organism provides HCoVs with a continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the host organism is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if the HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host organism at or before introduction to humans, it cannot adapt better to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host organism can act as an animal source of human infection and then act as a host that rapidly propagates human infection to humans.
If HCoVs cannot maintain transmission within the intermediate host organism, it will go through a closed pathway of infection.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate host organisms and even establish long-term nutrition.
In that case, the intermediate host organism becomes the host organism of the nature reserve.
Epidemiological data have disappointingly revealed that SARS index cases have a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent non-infection investigations showed that antisocial SARS-CoV lgG was more common in animal traders than in the general population.
The first live animal market to identify SARS-CoV-like viruses was in the mask palm civet cat (Pegoma larvata) and a raccoon dog that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supports the fact that no SARS was reported after killing all the saw-cat in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civet cats from forests or fields were largely negative for SARS-CoV without appearance in the live animal market, suggesting that masked palm civet cats may only be acting as expansive intermediate host organisms but not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since 80% of the different animals in Zhangzhou's markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility of several small mammals acting as expansive intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these appear to be SARS's closed-loop hosts.
The search for a natural host animal for SARS-CoV has resulted in the exposure of a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related rhinolophase bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), present in the Chinese horse-toed bat.
These bats are positive for antisense-SARS-CoV antibodies and have a genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host organisms of human pathogenesis.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than the designated WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is called a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from bat fecal samples was shown to be used as a receptor for the entry cell of bats, civet cats and human ACE2.
Interestingly, Sierra's recovered SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest representation of the SARS-CoV that is related to the bat species, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
However, despite the extreme similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the host organisms of the immediate reservoir of SARS-CoV.
MERS-CoV clusters from the same group were genetically analyzed as Bat CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5, the feline.
Both CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor, dipethyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
RNA-dependent RNA polymers sequence of MERS identified from Europe and Africa is polynetically closer to the counterparts in Beta-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Thus, bats cannot be the immediate host organism for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that in several African countries, such as Middle Eastern camels, camels with a cobalt have been seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific inactivating antibodies.
MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nose of a cobalt camel by a feather, further indicating that camels serve as reservoirs for the true host organism of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that experimentally MERS-CoV-infected camels were observed to have generally mild symptoms but large viral outbreaks.
In particular, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the primary route of virus outflow from bats.
However, questions remain as there is no history of camel-related transmission of several confirmed cases of MERS before the onset of symptoms, including human-to-human transmission or unknown animal species, which harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 CoV isolated from Ranulophus bat contributes 96.2% nucleotide similarity with RaT13 bat.
As with the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the paternal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for assigning.
I mean, bats cannot be the live-reserve host organisms of SARS-CoV-2 until nearly identical bats CoVs are found in the future.
Most likely, the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which has many early cases of COVID-19 associated with it and which potentially suggests animal-to-human transmission, will be the intermediate host animals for SARS-CoV-2 in the wildlife species sold and killed.
Several recent studies based on metagenetic sequences have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Mannus javenica) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2-related native B-ta CoVs.
These novel pangolin CoVs share 85%-92% nucleotide sequence similarity in genetics with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are as closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identification at the nucleotide sequence level.
These phylogenes are sub-genome clusters in the gene tree similar to SARS-CoV-2 viruses, one of which shares 97.4% amino acid sequence identity, as well as the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite a high degree of consistent matching genetic range, are more diverse.
Previous studies of sick pagolans reported the presence of viral postmortem from lung samples, which are similar to the related SARS-CoV-2.
This study used partial genetic sequencing, which accounts for about 86.3% of full-length viral genetics, adopted different assembly methods and manual protection.
We cannot rule out the possibility that penguins are one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence to support direct SARS-CoV-2 of pangolin origin due to sequence differences between the beta CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
While, the best sequence similarity was found in the receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARA-CoV-2 related beta CoVs, the best broad genetic sequence similarity was shared between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
It is highly speculative that, a selective mediation between the high-level similarity in the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs related to the SARS-CoV-2 pegolin is driven by careful evolution.
A counter-proposal in favor of recombination between the pangolin SARA-CoV-2 related beta CoVs and RaTG13 in the third wildlife species has been proposed.
The spread of large-scale recombination among beta-CoVs exists as a driving force in evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be determined.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied as having animal origins.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that the original source of both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
A bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Apalachin Ridge CoV) in the North American Ternate bat has been reported to show close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV termed hypocyndrosis/Ghanachovah/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and is also suspected to be an intermediate host organism on camels.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origins of identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of cases of transmission of mixed strains of HCoVs in history.
When domestic livestock HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans around 1890, a global epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E's mixed-variant transmission is less clear.
Beta-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca-alpha CoV.
Numerous evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in the shared ecological niche, bats can be the contact point for humans, not alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha CoVs are caused by respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpha CoV was not found in pets.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Napa and Handra viruses.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat-alpha CoVs act as a genetic pool for an HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels can act as intermediates, just like cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoVs serve as a prime example of mixed-species transmission from bats to one-celled camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by later findings.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus types for genetic fragments and transfers and international exchanges.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into one-clawed camels for decades.
It is well adapted in camels that have evolved from a direct host organism to a stable and natural reserve host organism.
MERS-CoV maintains very mild disease and relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its occasional transmission to humans is an accident and humans are closed-path host organisms for MERS-CoV as they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, Pangolin B-ta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be closed-path hosts for SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV, similar to the swift cats in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or rule out multiple possibilities of animal-to-human transmission of mixed strains of SARS-CoV-2.
First, the bat SARS-CoV-2, which is a nearly identical virus to SARS-CoV-2, may be the source of the host organism.
Humans share an ecological niche with bats through butchery or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be among the fastest intermediate hosts, with SARS-CoV-2-related viruses newly introduced.
Humans are exposed to the virus through butchery and hunting.
It is possible that several mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies are guaranteed in domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as described above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may originate in third species that interact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different host species, CoVs are important in facilitating three major factors by the virus in crossing several types of barriers.
First, they have relatively high rates of mutation in RNA replication.
Second, compared to isolated RNA viruses, the determined mutation rate of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of 10-4 replacements per year at each site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the novel host organisms to the CoV.
CoVs have proof-reading exocrine spores, which, when removed, become more mutagenic, attention-grabbing, and even undigestible.
Interestingly, nucleotide analogue remedies are known to suppress replication of CoVs by inhibiting this exocrine tunic and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is the most intelligent agent tested in clinical practice as a contrast agent SARA-CoV-2.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is a million times higher than that of their host organisms.
In addition, oftentimes when CoVs cannot adapt well to the host organism, the mutation rate is higher.
Compared to the highest mutation rate of SARS-CoV, SARA-CoV-2, which appears to have well-adapted to humans, has a low mutation rate.
It's likely that it's already adapted to another host near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which is well adapted in a cobalt camel, applies.
In theory, it is unlikely that enhanced genetics would immediately render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the genetics in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional modulation in genetic modification for modification and recombination of large RNAs, thus increasing the probability of hybrid variants co-evolving, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by the coding of several unique reading frames and lesion functions towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, through a unique mechanism of "copy selection", CoVs often switch randomly to RNA moulds.
During replication of CoV RNA, the host organism that acts as the mixer frequently changes its structure.
Full-length recombinations of highly homologous and subgenetic RNAs may be required to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of natural combinations of phylogenetics has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Communication of the virus host organism in the transmission chain
In addition to the above three viral factors, viral interaction with the host organism receptor is an important factor in efficient and mixed-variety transmission.
Furthermore, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a common example, which provided evidence of positive selection during mixed-species transmission.
In addition to comparative analysis of isolating human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoVs are thought to adapt rapidly in different host organisms, especially with mutations of the S-Lehm receptor binding domain.
Typically, the receptor binding domain in the S-chromosome of CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is strongly selective through the host organism's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 fragment is the 318th to 510th amino acid, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoVs are able to identify ACE2 receptors for the receptor-binding domain that is found in various animals, including bats, squirrel cats, rats and raccoon dogs, which allows the transmission of mixed strains of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues in the receptor binding domain were found to be different in the human and mouse isolated virus, 4 of which are found in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
The receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV strain has K479N and S487T mutations, which may enhance the interaction of the spike ligand with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids may be important sub-alternatives to viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy, however, that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 unit of the S lymph node indicates that the required binding of its S lymph node to human ACE2 may be altered.
Indeed, a TABED electron microscopy study is suggesting that the association is -10 to -20 times greater than the association between human ACE2 and the S-value of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether other sub-receptors are needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but with a different S-segment.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can account for the successful adaptation of these CoVs after a mixture of species has been transferred from their host animal to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of HCoV mixed-species transmission is monitored, depending on another host organism and by binding factors.
The spread of these host strains between humans and hosts with natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as bats, a collared camel and rats, may hinder mixed-species transmission.
HCoVs have both the aggressive host-dependent and the disruptive host-binding factors for a successful hybrid mutation.
In this regard, the molecular determination of the identification and characterization of this critical part of virus-host interaction remains to be determined.
Host-dependent and unbiased extensive genetic testing of binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may be beneficial using the latest CRISPR technology.
Novel HCoVs emissions: Go back to ground zero
Beta-CoV diversity provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a genetic pool for an HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also accelerate the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two key steps in the process.
The acquisition or deletion of novel lipid-coding genes, for example, has the potential to rapidly alter the phenotype of the virus.
In SARS-CoV helper viruses, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as were SARS-CoV-related bat viruses isolated but found to encode different ORF8 viruses.
29 nucleotide deletion characteristics of SARS-CoV were identified in strains isolated early in the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is a sympathetic mutation that promotes transcription in the host organism.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where RNA-dependent RNA polymers have identified small regions of recombination in large numbers.
The recombination sites were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been observed that the MERS-CoV outbreak, which occurred in a cow-calf camel in Saudi Arabia, has experienced recurrent episodes of recombination between different streams.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of recombination have also been observed in other CoVs, with HCoVs recombining with other animal CoVs with their unstructured genetics.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to undisclosed mutations in viral genetics, possibly as a result of selective pressure to escape, such as the host organism's immune system, from getting rid of the virus.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229 E, leading to deletion of two nucleotides.
Although the persistence of ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, Alpaca alpha-CoV shows the insertion of a single nucleotide, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their host organisms.
When bats are infected with CoVs, one is found to have no or mild symptoms, indicating a mutualistic adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in activating pro-inflammatory responses in bats effectively reduce pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, bats are depressed due to low levels of expression of natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 inhibitors and the major histocompatibility complex class I inhibitors.
Furthermore, reactivation of high levels of the oxygen species (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of bats, both by suppressing replication of CoVs, and by influencing proofreading by axory bonkels to form highly pathogenic virus strains, provides selective suppression when a new host organism is introduced.
More pathogenic CoV strains can be produced through recombination, which allows the host organism to grow to acquire novel pathogens or pathogenic properties to adapt.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their host organisms such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without the immune response of a powerful host organism.
It hides the secrets of why carriers are shown as asymptomatic and what causes severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine flow with a strong immune response, with more severe lung damage.
In contrast, in an asymptomatic carrier, the immune response is decoupled from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of decoupling immune responses has a beneficial effect in the treatment of antisocial SARA-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly potent in bats.
Therefore, the regulation of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflammatory function of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
Therefore, treating NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak follows the common belief emerging from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a bat beta-CoV has been found to share 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a bat-CoV that is sharing 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in the wild have been found to harbor viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host organism of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Pangolin B-CoVs have been surprisingly found to be homologous to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that the pangolins are acting as one of the intermediate host organisms or the pangolin B-CoVs may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
CoVs have resurfaced due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have radically changed our ideas about animal origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
The extensive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through an intermediate host organism.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-to-soweto contact in markets, the SARS epidemic can be effectively eliminated by closing meat markets and killing soweto.
For this reason, in view of the discovery of several strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, future investigations remain to clarify when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in single-clawed camels for a long time.
For the local people, these camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool, as well as the main means of transportation.
They are common in the Middle East and Africa.
So just as what was done in Chinese markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, along with other infection control measures, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS for camels.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, they can cause new genetic variants to emerge.
There are animal CoVs circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal diversity are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for animal CoVs to evolve and re-emerge as a result of future emissions of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19 trials, better preparedness and response plans must be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They live in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many of the characteristics that cause viruses to spread, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are educated.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future spread of the disease.
As a result, humans can more effectively prevent the spread of animal-to-human viruses by staying away from the environmental niche of natural reservoirs of animal-to-human disease viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of SARS-CoV-2's animal origins are still missing.
First, if bats transmit a SARS-CoV-2 pathogen to penguins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and penguins can share the same environmental strength.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, we should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal is to act as a true intermediary, it would have to explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats and penguins.
Finally, since many other mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and testing for infection should be conducted.
If bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent virus, which are almost identical, will be identified in its natural representatives.
Continued research in this field will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans, as well as explain the evolutionary journey of SARS-Cov-2 in animals.
Diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 need to be renewed
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Rapid Advisory Guide for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, which provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the global pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge of it is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and the experience of medical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, stating that we provide the most up-to-date diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" in accordance with the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh Edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak occurred, which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed an expedited advisory guide and it was published online on 06 February 2020 in Military Medical Research.
It has received much attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge of it is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and the experience of medical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued a Diagnostic and Treatment Guide for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with a total of seven issues released from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, which underwent some fundamental changes in context.
Now our guide has a comment from Zhao et al., who suggested simplifying scoring based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference for this global pandemic worldwide.
We acknowledge and thank them for their remarkable work.
However, their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh issue ((3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis is required to confirm a suspected case by combining one feature of the epidemic history with two items of medical explanation, or combining three items of medical explanation without a clear history of the epidemic:
Epidemic history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with clusters of confirmed cases (within a small area such as a classroom, school office, home, etc. with fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks ≥ 2 cases).
Clinical signs: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with conceptual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) white blood cell count at early onset indicating normal, decreased, or low lymphocyte count.
The pathogenic or serological evidence must include a diagnosis of a confirmed case on a suspected case with one of the following items: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of entire viral genetics showing high spelling of known novel coronaviruses; (3) a positive serum test for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgM antibody and lgG antibody; or a negative positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgG antibody or ≥4 times the recovery phase of the typhoid in the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) issues.
Pathogen detection in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and serological evidence was included in the seventh issue.
Research-based editing is ongoing to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis in verified criteria, as well as to take respiratory tract samples including blood samples that increase the availability of various samples, and contribute to positive results for specific antibodies.
In addition, there is much more evidence that reminds us to be cautious with traditional symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zoo et al. should be updated, because they classify an individual without medical symptoms as "low risk".
Scoring systems also need to be validated in further clinical practice and studies.
As a result, we hope for more direct evidence to come and ask readers to offer their feedback.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we advise them to track down and follow the latest guidelines in their home countries.
Our team updates our guide in a timely manner to offer support.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily number ever recorded
On the previous day, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Epidemiological Institute, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of reported infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Citing details in an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjedine Sabrina Flora said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mir Jeddi, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif al-Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Unit, who was treated at Kuwait's Matri Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obid al-Qadir, said that public transport will be closed for a long time from this coming week as per initial plans.
The closure of public transport initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential items -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
On 8 March, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded one million infections globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease that is caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries so far free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases after 10:00 am on 4 April (0800 UTC).
More than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the United States, linked to 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that, as of Wednesday, more than 1,000 Americans had died from coronavirus infections, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Around the world, countries announced strict measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to Russians without work would continue until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews for a full day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina Minora: previously, curfews were effective from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily.
Thailand will impose a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor, Mike Devine, announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order through May 1.
Australia's stores have reduced the amount of toilet paper in each transaction
On Sunday and weekdays, Australian store chains Walworth and Coles reduced the purchase restrictions on toilet tissue paper at all stores nationwide to two and one pack per transaction, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on the chain's check-outs, and Facebook back pages.
There were reports of buyers storing it in case people needed self-isolation due to fears of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet tissue paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The changes follow the four-pack per transaction restrictions previously introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in a media release on March 8, said that with the four-pack restriction in one place, "many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
According to a Wolverine spokesperson, last week's sales "greatly increased".
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number of packs allowed to two last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coils ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the sequence of deliveries, Woolworth ordered additional stock, while ADLI stockpiled for special early availability on a planned Wednesday.
The executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, Russell Zimmerman, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but restrictions on delivery truck timing by the local council have made it difficult.
They've also increased production costs, because suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after a stock discount, some stores could not operate on specific Wednesdays.
Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, told a News.com.au report that stores are filling up every night.
He said that toilet paper is a big thing, which makes it a small quantity to store, and, when sold, leaves a huge shelf space empty, leading to a severe shortage.
Russell Zimmerman said on ABC News, Coils and Woolworth's review [is] that if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if products like toilets and sanitizers can be [bought] and if they're in quantity, maybe you can reduce panic.
A creepy recycled toilet tissue paper maker said last Wednesday that it would run out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly Clark, who makes Clean's toilet tissue, and Solaris, who makes Sorbent, insisted they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
Domain.com, a property buying and selling site, reported that some sellers of property in Melbourne offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auction, with some auctions held when buyers had time due to the long weekend on International Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of the daily Darwin, NT News, included eight-page encyclopedias meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were actually reluctant to impose the restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce a shopping ban.
Russell Zimmerman also said that other products including masks, sanitary ware, dry goods, hand washers and flour are also in high demand.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, British supermarket shopping was observed to be limited to packs of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19  a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  a global pandemic.
Although the word "epidemic" refers to the rapid onset of a disease, not to how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need for action by governments.
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries in response detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people,
We are deeply concerned about both aspects of this disease, the speed and severity of its onset and the alarming scale of the response.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in his remarks published in CNN in February, "Besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has had such a sequence from its inception to the global pandemic".
Ghiberyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a global pandemic that was preceded by a coronavirus".
He continued, "And we've never seen a global pandemic that could be controlled at the same time".
The new global pandemic status followed the announcement in January of the World Health Organization's decision to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "The bottom line is, it is going to be more catastrophic".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide was 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and identified as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
China's death rate is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Complications may include pneumonia and symptoms of severe breathing difficulties.
The period from onset to onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive - recommended precautions include hand-washing, mouth-covering during meals, social distancing, and monitoring and strict isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have been vocal in their support for travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk control and closure of facilities.
The pandemic disrupted many global socio-economic, religious, political and cultural events and led to widespread shortages of goods due to desperate shopping.
Schools and universities in 193 countries have either closed nationally or locally, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Misconceptions about the virus spread online and there were cases of prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, people of other races in East and Southeast Asia, and people where the virus was most prevalent.
Low traffic and the closure of large industries have reduced air density and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China reported a collection of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of these cases were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to be a derivative of animal diseases.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that was closely related to the bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first person to show symptoms of the disease was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent link to the male varicose vein.
Two-thirds of the initial cases reported in December 2019 were related to markets.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post in an unverified report recommended that a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province on 17 November 2019 may be the first case.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although cases in China were declining, due to a sudden spike in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded new cases inside China for the first time.
It may also be that the number of cases is underreported, especially in people with normal symptoms of the disease.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, with global incidence at 2.4%. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Valance estimated that 60% of the UK population would be affected before effective crowd screening could be achieved.
According to official protocol, cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be positive.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and many countries had a government policy of not testing only people with mild symptoms, as in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients were undetectable as of 23 January and that the unregistered patient was the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections reported in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
The initial baseline recombination estimate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't, the time from onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
As of 5 February, nearly 80% of deaths in China were among people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic is generally those who tested positive for COVID according to official protocol.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it does not include those who die without testing - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during this global pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official number of COVID deaths.
"We know that [the number of reported deaths] has been underreported", a spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged, a statement that confirms reports of underreporting of deaths in the United States. Such underreporting is common during global pandemics as it was during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths had occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions, from every continent except the frozen South Pacific, reported deaths. Several common measures are used to determine deaths.
The number varies with region and time, and is influenced by testing, quality of treatment systems, treatment options, time after the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The incidence-to-death ratio is obtained by dividing the number of deaths in a given period by the number of diagnosed cases.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-incidence ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
The incidence-to-death ratio in China (for individuals from onset of symptoms to January 10-10, 2020) has decreased from 17.3% to 0.7% (for individuals from onset of disease to February 1, 2020).- Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) which shows the percentage of people diagnosed as dying from the disease, and the infection-to-death rate (IFR) which shows the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These time-series are not for a specific time and are for a specific population from infection to final resolution.
Several experts have tried to calculate this number for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection mortality rate in this global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with the results of earlier randomized COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the global pandemic is controllable.
The emergence and final duration of the pandemic vary and are uncertain by location.
"If left unchecked, the multiple outbreaks usually rise like a plateau and then start to fall when the disease no longer has a host", said McKidge-Boney of Penn State University.
But it's absolutely impossible to make a reasonable plan for when it's going to happen right now".
Zong Nanshang, the top medical adviser to the Chinese government, insisted that "it could be over by June" if all countries were encouraged to follow the WHO's advice on measures to contain the outbreak of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue to circulate for one or two years".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will 'go away completely' because it's so easily transmissible", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, and it "will turn into a seasonal disease, and keep coming back every year".
The mortality of the return will depend on reducing the African population and its degree of variability.
The symptoms of COVID-19 disease can be relatively mild and affected people may be asymptomatic.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include vomiting, a lump in the throat (the throat), loss of the ability to smell, shortness of breath, joint and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing up blood, diarrhea, or blue urine. The World Health Organization reports that about 1 in 4 people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as: difficulty breathing, frequent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present - further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, body rot, bleeding disorders, and death.
Some of these infected individuals may be asymptomatic, they may be considered confirmed patients without clinical symptoms, so researchers have recommended that people who have been in close contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
China's proportion of asymptomatic cases is measured in the few-digit range of 44%.
The incubation period (the average time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.As an example of the uncertainty situation, the loss of the sense of smell in people infected with COVID-19+ was initially in 30% of people and later decreased to 15% of people.
Some details of how the disease begins are still being worked out.
The disease is thought to be initially transmitted by close contact and by small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking; where close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) apart.
Studies have shown that drops can be made from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) without a drill.
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that remain in the air for long periods of time that form during speech.
These droplets can penetrate into the mouth or nose of nearby people or possibly into the lungs when breathing.
Some medical procedures such as a tube infusion and CPR can release the respiratory fluid and thus release it into the air.
It can also start when someone touches an affected surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it may also spread through faces, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through excretion.The virus is highly contagious for up to three days before the onset of symptoms, although it can also be present before symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
Since people can test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that transmission of the disease is possible even before the onset of effective symptoms.
There have been only a few laboratory-confirmed cases reported with no pre-existing symptoms, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected during the investigation of contacts in several countries.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can generally infect two to three people - the virus can survive on different surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for four hours.
However, the duration varies with humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as they do when in contact with other surfaces chewed by an infected person.
Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people who developed pneumonia that belonged to the group of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding physiological coronaviruses - outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated by household soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is believed to be derived from animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the family of B-tacocoronavirus, along with two strains of the subfamily of the chamois-derived beta-coronavirus (B-strain).
At the total genome level, it has a 96% similarity to another bat coronavirus specimen (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one amino acid difference was found in a few parts of the genome sequence in human and pangolin viruses.
Comparisons of the complete genome to date have shown that almost 92% of the genetic material is shared between pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Temporary diagnosis of viral infection can be based on the symptoms of the disease, although confirmation from the infected fluid or ICT X-ray is ultimately done by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan found that CT, although less specific than PCR, is significantly more sensitive, although its imaging properties dominate the processes of other pneumonia and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test simultaneously uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is done on a sample of the airway or blood.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
The test is usually done with a synthetic cotton, although cotton can also be used in the throat - several laboratories and companies are also developing mosquito tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Selex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only in authorized laboratories.
The imaging features on radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms of the disease include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opposites and absent hyperfluidity.
The Italian Radiological Society is creating an international online database of imaging results of confirmed events.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging identification of COVID-19 without PCR validation has limited features.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR, showing that although the imaging for infection is less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it should be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based bulging neural networks were created to detect the image characteristics of the virus, both through radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, rubbing hands, unwashed eye, nose or mouth, and coughing and sneezing into tissue and dumping tissue directly into the trash.
People who already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Social distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease - several countries have restricted travel or banned non-essential travel to other countries or to areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the point of community transmission in much of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some people in the community do not know how and where they have been infected - healthcare providers who are concerned about the disease are advised to take standard precautions about contact and eye protection - contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to find the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised by governments using the palace's data via mobile phones for this purpose, and Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
As of April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented it or recommended it for voluntary use, with more than a dozen groups working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to access a user's location from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions circulate about infection prevention; for example, nasal spraying and rinsing with a mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however, several organizations are working on one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the onset of disease.
The CDC often recommends that people wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are obviously dry; before eating; and after someone wipes their nose, coughs, or coughs.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap when its protective shell reaches its maximum.
The CDC recommends the use of more alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth without using a hand towel.
Surfaces should also be purified by several methods (stainless steel surfaces exposed to a disinfectant for one minute), including 62-71% ethanol, 50%-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% pavidon-iodine.
Other methods, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidric gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or confirmed COVID case occurs in a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas - offices, restrooms, shared lavatories, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, which are used by sick people - be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths with their curved elbows or tissue when coughing or sneezing and immediately destroy such tissue.
Wearing a surgical mask is recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing a mask limits both the volume and distance of droplets emitted by an affected person when they talk, sneeze and cough.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how masks should be worn.
According to University of Leeds virologist Stephen Griffin, "wearing a mask [can] reduce the likelihood of people touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if chewed without proper hand hygiene".
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as when treating a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing masks prevents people from chewing their face.
Several countries have begun encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric - China specifically recommends that healthy people in the public use disposable medical masks, especially when likely to be near other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transportation or staying in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that everyone wear a mask when entering shops.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when going out in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks on trains and buses running between cities from April 1.
In Panama, wearing a face mask is mandatory when going out, while at home, masks are recommended for those who cannot afford them.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves disease control actions aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing practices by staying at home, avoiding crowds, not receiving greetings, and physically distancing from each other.
Many governments are enforcing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (where the area was mapped as having no known cases of COVID-19) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and people with a medical condition such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system can face severe illness and complications, and have been advised by the CDC to stay home for longer due to the outbreak in the community.
The term social distancing has led people to assume that they should be completely isolated from the world, rather than being encouraged to connect with others in alternative ways.Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health during the global pandemic.
They also include recommendations to have sex only with a cohabitant who has no symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected to be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-quarantine. Many governments have mandated or recommended that the entire population living in an affected area go into self-quarantine.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued for those who are in the high-risk group.
People who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an epidemic are prevention, control, or stress and mitigation.
A containment strategy is developed in the early stages of an epidemic and aims to identify and isolate infected people, introduce other infection control measures and vaccinate to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from spreading further, the first step is the mitigation phase: measures are taken to reduce its spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures should be taken together.
To contain a global epidemic, more drastic measures are needed to bring the baseline outbreak rate back to less than 1. Part of infectious disease outbreak management is to try to slow the epidemic's rise, called flattening outbreaks.
This reduces the concern for health services, which are becoming overwhelmed, and provides more time to develop vaccines and find treatments.
Non-pharmacological measures that can manage the outbreak include preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling social events; involving the community to encourage people to accept and participate in such interventions; and environmental measures such as keeping surfaces clean - the most stringent measures taken in China to contain the outbreak once the epidemic is over, such as quarantining cities and imposing strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have taken a number of different measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented mass screening and local quarantine and issued warnings on the movement of affected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to affected people who self-quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and authorized storage of medical supplies. The similarities between the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (reducing but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and containment (expanding the global epidemic) are major challenges.
Over-reduction policies can reduce the rise in health care demand by two-thirds and the death rate by half, but they can still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelm the health system.
Stress can be preferred as a transmission but should continue as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is first) otherwise it quickly reverts to recovery when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain a global pandemic have led to social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including trials on existing drugs.
Taking cold medications, drinking plenty of water, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygenation, intravenous injections, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Many compounds that were previously approved to treat other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has also said that "some traditional and home remedies" can alleviate SARS-CoV-19 illness.
Increasing the capacity and adaptability of healthcare providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been identified by the World Health Organization as a key step in the response to the pandemic.
The CDC and WHO Regional EU Office have issued guidelines for resource transition for hospitals and primary health centers at various stages, including focusing on laboratory services on the ability to test for COVID-19, eliminating optional procedures wherever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and increasing intensive care capacity and the number of available ventilators and beds through staff training.
There are many theories as to where the first episode (i.e. patient zero) may have started.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei began to rise gradually.
Most of these cases are believed to have originated from the wholesale sea market in Hunan, where live animals are also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from this species; in other words, it is a virus from the animal pathogen. A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated at Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jixian, who reported to Wuhan Xiangnan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central Wuhan hospital warned their colleagues about "SARS-like coronaviruses".
Eight of them, including Le Van Liang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors and another, Ai Fan, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading sarcasm.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public statement on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
By early January, enough cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to Wuhan health authorities to warrant an investigation. The number of cases doubled roughly every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, with transportation for the Chinese New Year playing a major role as Wuhan was a major transportation and rail interchange.
China reported 140 new cases in a single day on 20 January, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy for the highest number of confirmed cases globally. As of 9 April 2020, there are more than 1.61 million cases reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 are recovering.
At least one case has occurred in nearly 200 countries and territories.
Due to this globalization in Europe, several countries in the Schengen area have restricted movement and have established a system of border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantine (known as home stay orders, shelter orders or lockdowns) and curfew. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the population, are currently in some form of lockdown, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines under lockdown, nearly 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India under lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion two days later, which is almost a third of the world's population.
The first case of the COVID-19 virus was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unverified report reports the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jian observed an outbreak of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, which his hospital notified the Wuhan Xiangnan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic sampling tests of patients on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronaviruses.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public warning on December 31.
WHO was notified on the same day.
When the reports came in, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police not to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that these were not "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched an extremist campaign that was later dubbed a "people's war" by Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, to contain the virus outbreak.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sweeping cleanup campaign was announced on 23 January banning movement from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in several places.
Authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshen Shan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Then another hospital, the Leixões Hospital, was built to handle the additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums.On 26 January, the government took further measures to control the outbreak of COVID-19, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.

In response to the decision by central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan on 23 January, WHO representative Gaudin Ghia said that while there was really "no recommendation from the WHO" on this, it was still "a significant sign of the determination to control the epidemic in a place where the epidemic has reached its peak" and described it as an "unprecedented event in public health history". After confirmation of human-to-human transmission of the disease outside China on 30 January, and due to the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), a type of PHEIC that is different from the one that began during the 2009 global flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was "a global pandemic risk factor, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems".
On the response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros said that measures that unnecessarily interfere with global travel and trade were not needed "and that the World Health Organization advises limited trade and movement".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the global community for $675 million to help with developing strategies for the pandemic with low-income countries, citing the urgent need for assistance to countries that do not have a system in place to track people who have the virus, even if it does start".
Tedros further stated that "we are only as strong as our connections are weak" and urged the global community to invest today or pay more later.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to use "the power of the entire UN system" to respond to the disease.
The result was the activation of a UN Crisis Group, which was allowed to coordinate all UN responses, which, according to the World Health Organization, would allow them to focus on health responses while other bodies could broadly offer their expert opinions on the social, economic and developmental factors of the pandemic.
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO was activated with China to assist international and WHO experts in domestic organization on Chinese territory and to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions and "visiting areas to assess the impact of response activities at the provincial and district level, including urban and rural areas".

The virus may be coming and you need to be prepared", stressing that the right response measures can help save the world from "its worst".
Ryan added that current data does not allow public health officials to declare the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we fundamentally recognize that every human on the planet will be affected by this virus".
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic.

Some commentators believe the move may be to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier acknowledgments of coronavirus outbreaks that began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories of COVID-19 originating in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that Chinese censorship made a virus so powerful that it has now become a global pandemic, which was criticized by some critics in response as biased and "an excuse to distract from administrative negligence in preventing the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a US government cable in which a letter apparently discussing Hikmet Ali in a conversation with a person at the National Security Council said "it's all about China".

Coronavirus was blamed for the food shortage incidents, which were caused by increased global consumption of epidemic prevention equipment, panic buying and disruption of factory and supply processes.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical supplies that were triggered by rising consumer demand and disrupted supply.
Many areas saw shopping in a panic, leaving shelves empty of Asian necessities such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, creating a supply shortage.
The tech industry in particular issued a warning of delayed delivery of electronic goods.

This demand has led to a 20-fold increase in the average price and a four- to six-month delay in the delivery of medical supplies.
This has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which WHO has warned could put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the global pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
These activities led to a shortage of infant food in some supermarkets which was subsequently immediately banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the growing demand for food items, both areas survived severe food shortages.
China and Italy's efforts to stockpile essential goods and combat illicit trade have been successful, as they have prevented the severe food shortages that were expected in North America and Europe.
Northern Italy, which is very important for agricultural production, has not seen a significant drop in production, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Food shelves have been temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials have released pork stocks to ensure the population has an abundant food supply.

In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany put their workers on a government-sponsored short-term work scheme called Kurzerbeit.
Germany's short-term work compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and the UK.
The global arts and heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of institutions as well as individuals, including both the large-scale employment and the self-employed.
The arts and culture sector organizations tried to maintain their mission (which is often publicly supported) to provide access to cultural heritage to society, maintain the protection of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, art venues and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and events have been cancelled or postponed.
In response, considerable efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapid failure of the disease was the cancellation of religious services, key Khel events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a setback. The Vatican announced that Holy Saturday in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian Lent season, was canceled.
Many pastors have advised older Christians to stay home rather than attend Sunday services; some churches have begun broadcasting church services on the radio, live on TV, or online while others sit in their cars.
As the Roman Catholic clergy closed their churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square became empty of Christian visitors, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and parishes.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers and closed shrines in areas affected by the pandemic, while Saudi Arabia closed the entrance to foreign visitors and the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
This global pandemic, since World War II, has caused significant disruption to the world's sports calendar.
Major sports events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA, SES, and 2019-20 NHL, have been cancelled or postponed.
The spread has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the activity "will be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other sports venues will be closed and live poker tournaments will be postponed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers moving online, and many online gambling sites have seen a significant increase in new signups. The entertainment industry has also been particularly affected, with many music groups postponing or cancelling their concert tours.
Many major theaters, like those on Broadway, have also canceled all performances.
Many artists have discovered ways to work online and share their work as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming events, or to create web-based "festivals" so that artists can perform, spread the word and promote their work.
Online, many memes based on the idea of the coronavirus have spread as many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a lot of bigotry, xenophobia, fear of strangers and racism towards people in China and East Asia, Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic has been severe.
There have been reports of fear, suspicion and opposition, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
According to reports in February (while most cases were confined to China), racist sentiments were expressed against Chinese citizens in various groups around the world that justified the virus's claim to be retaliatory.
Anti-Chinese sentiment is also seen in some African countries.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei reported being treated differently on a regional basis.
For the Chinese, both online and offline, and those in the affected areas, support has been provided.
After the outbreak spread to other countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience an outbreak of COVID-19, may be suspicious and fearful of strangers.Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people as well as other Asian residents in the UK and US have reported incidents of racism-based abuse and insults.
US President Donald Trump has faced severe criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term that critics have called racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuee Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhere.
Students from northern India, which borders China, and studying in India's major cities have been subjected to harassment over the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, stated that China has ruined nature and "that is why God has avenged them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Calcutta, calling it "misleading". Since the global pandemic in China, fear of foreigners has been fueled by racist sentiments towards foreign Chinese residents, with foreigners being called "foreign trash" to "squeeze in".
Many paywalls have been removed by newspapers for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers about this outbreak available to the public.
Many scientists sent their results to a server, such as bioRixiv, before they were quickly published.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes procedures that detect the presence of the virus and the presence of antibodies that are produced as a result of infection.
RT-PCR samples confirm the presence of the virus, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infection.
Antibodies (serology) can also be used to detect, diagnose and monitor populations.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those who had symptoms so mild that they were too mild to report or who showed no symptoms at all.
The results of these tests can be used to determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity in a population.
Due to limited testing, as of mid-2020 no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are also significant differences in how much testing is done between countries.
The reporting of mortality rates due to this variant varies greatly, likely being higher than estimated in some countries.
Testing on a breath sample using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be achieved in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The PT-PCR throat-speech test is only reliable in the first week of illness.
Later, when it begins to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears into the throat.
For infected individuals tested the second week, alternative sample material can be used via a deep airway suction catheter or cough-up material (throat).
The first PCR tests will be developed using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the Charité site in Berlin in January 2020 which will form the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the UK had also developed a test.On 28 January 2020, South Korean company kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene that is transmitted by the beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2.BGI Group in China was among the first companies to receive emergency use approval for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Medical Products Administration.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through International Regent Resource.
One in three tests in the older version of Test Kitone failed due to poor chemical interaction, and less than 100 samples were collected per day throughout February 2020 due to testing disruptions at the CDC in Atlanta.
As of 28 February 2020, two-component tests were not considered reliable, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made available COVID-19 testing across the country as of 9th March 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; sample collection and further processing should be in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was created and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Service. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed a test for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the test, which could be performed in a large number of 3.5 hours, i.e. a machine could perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly obtained EUA from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method gives positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase the number of machines it can manufacture to 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses monoclonal antibodies specifically restricted to the nucleotide protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid influenza test.
A review of written materials in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic radiography diagnosis is not relevant at the initial stage, however the presence of [CT computed tomography] before symptoms appear is possible".
Common features of CT are two-way multi-loop ground glass opacity including asymmetric and posterior division coverage.
It grows like a disease, developing into total dominance, madness, smoothness and stability.
In Wuhan, where the global outbreak originated, a study comparing PCR and CT suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many features similar to pneumonia and disease stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first priority for the diagnosis of COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
The partial immune response to infection, including IgM and IgG, is the production of antibodies.
They can be used to detect infection in individuals who have had symptoms for 7 days, to assess immunity, and for individuals who are under close surveillance.
Automated systems designed for high throughput in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the throughput rate for each system.
A single blood sample is usually used for CLT, although many samples can be used to diagnose immunity.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually obtained by drilling into the skin.
Unlike the PCR procedure, no prior emission testing is required.On 26 March 2020, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notifications to the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their own antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples, at the end of March 2020.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is faster than traditional PCR for detecting RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK learned that none of the test kits purchased were sufficiently accurate for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", spit in it, send it back and get a result after a while. The UK NHS has announced that it is launching a pilot scheme to test suspected cases at home, eliminating the risk of the patient passing the infection to others or if they come to the hospital, the ambulance will be free of the need to disinfect them once used. For suspected COVID-19 patients, a drive-through test, a public health professional collects a sample after taking appropriate precautions.
Thanks to drive-through centers, South Korea has conducted more tests faster and more efficiently than any other country.The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that it has the capacity to perform 12,000 tests per day in a normal setting and will do 10,700 tests last week.
When it comes to physician testing, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
The drive-in test was offered in several major cities until March 19.
The number of tests performed in Germany as of 26 March 2020 was not known, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, 483,295 samples were tested by calendar week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) this week tested positive for 2-SARS-CoV. Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and adopted a procedure to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, collecting all samples and only testing further if the sample is positive. A 2,000 square meter temporary laboratory with an emergency detection unit called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼), or "Fire Eye" in English, was established in Wuhan, launched by BGI on 5 February 2020.
What's that?
The Wuhan lab's methodology was quickly adopted by the Hu-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus bringing the total to 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open source multi-component designs that can test 1122 patients of COVID-19 in just 93 attempts. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without robotic fluid handlers.
As of March, shortages and insufficient doses of the reagent have become a barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to investigate protocols for sample preparation that heat samples to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome or chromosome for further testing.According to a March 31 announcement, the UAE is now testing more of its population for coronavirus than any other country, and is on track to reach its entire population.
Such drive-through capacity and large-scale population-built laboratory benefits from both Grooup 42 and BGI (based on their China-based emergency detection laboratories "HUO-Yan").
The lab, set up in 14 days, performed 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day and was the first lab outside China to operate on such a large scale.
Various testing techniques were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile.
The World Health Organization used the German recipe for low-income countries that don't have the resources to make the kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020, the protocols developed in the United States to control the disease were not available until 28 January, which delayed the tests available in the United States. There were concerns about the quality of test kits in China and the United States in the early days of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide kits despite recommendations and demand from health experts.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's large supply of testing slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has boosted testing capacity in private sector laboratories in the past few years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization urged to strengthen testing programs to slow the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic.The high spread of the virus led to increased testing demand and tens of millions of tests being held back in US private laboratories, and pressure on the supply of wound cleaning tubes and chemotherapy agents.
In March 2020, China reported an issue with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the US, the CDC's kits had "defects", the government then removed the clerical barriers that had hindered private testing. Spain bought the kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not valid.
The firm explained that the reason for the false results was a sample collection error or improper use of the cuts.
The Spanish ministry said that the kits giving false results would be removed and replaced with testing kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the kits purchased from China by the Czech state gave false results.
Prime Minister Matviç suggested that they be dumped into the Danube River. Atatürk's health ministry said the kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and were "not put into use".
Testing for positive results in quarantined individuals and in the detection of individuals who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients has shown positive results.
In the Italian town of Vo, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in the entire population, which consisted of approximately 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
Almost half of the people tested had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
Restricting travel to certain human groups completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to extensive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the global coronavirus pandemic of 2020 had a much smaller impact on Singapore than developed countries around the world, where there were no strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay home from March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed to contain the global pandemic through strict measures such as contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but not through more stringent lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, in terms of mortality, had lower mortality rates, probably because they were able to detect people with few or no symptoms.
WHO has recommended that countries that do not have the testing capacity and national laboratories to deal with COVID-19 send their top five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below refers to a country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospital would have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all of its citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, they would treat everyone equally.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning one's hands of dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap several times a day on "essential occasions" prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and diarrhea.
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five essential times of the day when handwashing with soap is essential: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the bottom of the baby or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or after touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, wash hands with soap. The World Health Organization recommends the following:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating a patient.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the compliance of medical procedures with hygienic principles.
Hand washing or medical care before taking medication can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing medically is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microscopic germs that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or spread disease.
This is especially true for people in the food and medical industries, but it's also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing causes of diarrheal disease; reducing respiratory infections;
And lower infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study shows that improving handwashing habits slightly improves height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce child deaths from respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple process can reduce deaths from these diseases by up to 50 percent.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrheal death rates by a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
The death rate from diarrhea can be reduced by up to 48% due to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, changing the practice of handwashing before and after meals to a natural way of life could save more lives than using a vaccine or medically intervening, i.e. halving deaths from diarrhoea and a quarter reduction in deaths from severe respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually part of other health and hygiene activities, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against early illnesses that are directly transmitted by the bite.
A minor drawback of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin from dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy skin called pinbelly, or skin inflammation, common in medical professionals.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times of day when handwashing with soap is essential to reduce the spread of disease through feces and mouthwashing: after using the bathroom (urine or flushing), after cleaning the bottom of the baby (change of diaper), before feeding the baby, before and after eating and before and after preparing food or before and after touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other occasions when hand washing should be done properly to prevent transmission include: before and after handling a wound; after sneezing, coughing, or rinsing the nose; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after handling litter.
Many countries have low handwashing rates.
According to a 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate at 97%, the United States is in the middle at 77% and China has the lowest rate at 23%. Many behaviors change current practices to increase handwashing rates with soap at critical times.
The mandatory "Health Protection Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the massive promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes disinfecting twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap, fluoridated teeth brushing.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The skin disinfection process has been improved by adding soaps and detergents to water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the dissolving barrier and increase the solubility.
Water alone is insufficient for cleansing the skin because the grease and protein, which are components of organic soil, are not easily soluble in water.
Cleaning, however, is aided by proper water flow.
Solid soaps, because of reuse, because of past use, can contain bacteria.
A few studies that have studied the transmission of bacteria from solid contaminated soaps say that it cannot be transmitted because the bacteria are released with the foam.
The CDC still says "Liquid soap without hand control is preferred".
Antibacterial soaps have been highly promoted in the health-conscious public.
There is no evidence yet that the use of recommended antibiotics produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic organisms.
So if antibacterial soaps don't choose to be antibiotic resistant, they won't be as effective as they're being told.
In addition to moisturizers and skin protective agents, high-fiber formulations can contain active benzoic acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, and skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A detailed analysis by the University of Oregon, School of Public Health, found that simple soaps are just as effective for consumers as antibacterial soaps containing triclosan, which protects against disease and removes bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that you have in your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37°C).
However, semi-heated, soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural oil, which absorbs dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies say that semi-heated water is not effective at reducing hand germs.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, water-based non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed in a concentrator, such as carbomer (a polysaccharide polysaccharide compound) in a jelly-like substance or a liquid such as glycerin foamed to a liquid or to ease use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding oxide to dissolved hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective disinfectants.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccinia, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-containing breast sanitizers containing 70% alcohol (a decrease of 3.5 logs, which is equivalent to a decrease of 35 decibels) kill 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of use and 99.99% to 99.999% (a decrease of 4 to 5 logs) after 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are very effective for bacteria and less effective for a few other viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against Norwalk's, the most common cause of infectious small bowel disease.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and end of all fingers are massaged for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be washed thoroughly and rubbed on the palms of both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with a sanitizer, especially when hands are obviously contaminated.
The rapid use of such materials is due to their ease of use and ability to quickly disinfect; however, they should not be considered a substitute for regular hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizers can dry out the skin, unless the formula includes creams and/or skin moisturizers.
Glycerin and/or other creams may be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical trials have shown that using alcohol-based hand sanitizers that included creams, soaps or antimicrobial detergents, caused less skin irritation and dryness.
Allergies may occasionally occur due to various early illnesses or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to the presence of narcotics in alcohol.
They are more likely to wash their hands with soap and water because they are less prone to inflammatory bowel disease.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents cannot purify organic matter, they only disinfect it.
That's why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many germs, because germs live on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends largely on ingredients and synthesis, and historically they have not been very effective.
In recent times, the formulations that have used benzalkonium chloride, unlike alcohol, have shown overall antimicrobial activity after use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to skin reactions, its effectiveness has decreased.
In many low-income communities, people cannot afford soap and use ash or mud instead.
Ash and dirt can be more effective than just water, but less so than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or ash is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when mixed with water.
WHO recommends ash or dirt in the absence of soap.
Proper handwashing procedures recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of disease include:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, regardless of water temperature.
Rub hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the mid-finger spaces and the undersides of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Meet for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Washing hands in a basin can re-contaminate them.
Wipe with a dry towel or let air dry.
Wet and damp hands can easily become re-infected. Commonly omitted areas include the thumb, wrist, interdigital spaces, and the sides of the nails.
Fingerprints and semi-perforated nail polishes can be a target for germs.
Moisturizing lotions are usually recommended to protect hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided, such as pouring water from a hanging can or a poppy garden with adequate holes and/or using ash in developing countries when needed. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" or other low-cost methods.
Tip-tap is a simple technology that consists of a jug suspended from a rope and a lever that moves with the feet to add a little bit of water to a hand and soap pillow.
Effective hand drying is part of hand hygiene, but there is debate about the most effective way to dry in public restrooms.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric dryers, which are often found in sanitary facilities.
In 2008 the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, and it was sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, the paper towel industry. It included paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet air dryers in terms of hygiene standards.
After hand washing and hand drying with a hot air dryer, the bacterial rate on the fingertips increased by an average of 194 percent and on the palms by 254 percent.
Drying with a jet air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in bacterial rates on the finger pads and 15% on the palms.
After hand washing and tissue paper drying, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreased by an average of 76% and on the palms by 77%. The scientists also tested to prove whether all types of drying procedures had the potential to spread contamination to other washroom users and the washroom environment.
The jet air dryer, which expels air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs from the hands and unit and can contaminate other users of the sanitary warehouse and the sanitary warehouse environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
A hot-air hand dryer can spread germs up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No specific germs are spread from the tissue. A 2005 study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt examined different hand drying procedures.
The following changes in bacterial counts occurred after hand drying:
There are many hand dryers and various manufacturers of dryers, and dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with sanitary paper is an alternative in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol.
Clinically, hand washing was made mandatory in 1846, after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to hospital staff to remind them to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that their use reduced infection rates.
Clinically, hand washing is at least 15 seconds, with soap and water or a gel applied in sufficient quantity to foam and rub all parts of the hand.
Fingers are interlocked and rubbed together.
If there is a stain on the fingernails, a hard bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on the hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and if necessary to open the back door).
This will prevent the hands from getting contaminated again after contact with these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing rates are unacceptably low even in the medical environment, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus becoming a source of germ transmission.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple practices reduce urinary tract infections by 66%. The World Health Organization published a paper showing proper hand washing and hand-washing practices in the health sector.
The draft guidance on hand hygiene from the agency can be viewed on their website for public comment.
A related review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can test and validate hand hygiene, if required to do so.
The World Health Organization has identified "five occasions" for hand washing:
When exposed to blood/body moisture
Before the sterilization, and
After the patient is taken care of, adding a chemical disinfectant to the soap (a "medicated or "antimicrobial" soap) gives the hand washing agent the function of disinfecting.
Disinfection is required before surgery or where antibiotic-resistant organisms are abundant. To "rub" your hands, you need a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching, washed with chlorhexidine or iodine, a sterile towel to dry after hand washing, a sterile brush to rub, and another sterile tool to clean fingernails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This process involves washing hands from the wrist to the elbows, usually 6 to 2 minutes.
Long rubbing (10 minutes) is not required.
When pouring water over the middle of the arm, be careful not to let it back into the hands.
When hand washing is complete, hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical gowns are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after seeing a patient or apply a hand sanitizer.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has shown that the greatest benefits of hand hygiene were obtained from the first 20% washing, and that little additional benefit was obtained when the rate was increased from 35%.
The use of plain soap was three times more effective than antibacterial soap in transmitting bacterial infectious disease in the diet. Comparing hand rubbing with alcohol-based solutions and 30 seconds of antibacterial soap each, it was found that hand rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solutions in removing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Improving hand hygiene in healthcare settings would require staff training on hand washing, availability of alcohol-based hand solution, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which interventions are most effective in a variety of health settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered to be a cheap, healthy, even nutritious way to get by.
However, the lack of a steady supply of water, soap and handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a major challenge to adopt universal handwashing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is very rare to have a hand washing faucet near a private or public toilet, although many low-cost cases of hand washing sites are possible.
However, the decreased handwashing rate may be due to a more mature habit than a lack of soap and water.
Encouraging and advertising handwashing with soap can influence decision-making, create awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and create far-reaching changes in population behavior.
Monitoring and testing are essential to make this work.
A formal study of 70 students found that working in a particular community is more effective in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One approach to promoting handwashing in schools is the "three-star approach" from UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene principles.
When they reach the minimum, schools can go to second and then third star.
The creation of handwashing sites can be part of a handwashing campaign, which aims to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is the second example of this campaign campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the need for a change in behaviour. In the wake of the 2019-20 global coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of handwashing emoji.
Some studies have found that overall handwashing is less costly in developing countries, ignoring DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing with soap is less costly than managing water and sanitation.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in the hospital - was first recognized by two of the first hand hygiene physicians in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, who is "the founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people still believed that infection was caused by bad breath, or decomposition.
In the 1980s, due to foodborne illnesses and public health-related infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more intensively promoted hand hygiene as the main means of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries that handwashing with soap is essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "proper hand washing techniques" were hung outside public toilets in hand washing places, in office toilets and at airports in Germany.
The saying "wash one's hands of" means that a person declares that he will not take responsibility for something or say anything.
The saying originates in the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expresses disapproval of the decision to crucify Jesus, but it later became a proverb in English-speaking societies.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth finds herself forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clear a fictional stain, which reveals her guilty conscience for murdering her husband.
It's also been found that after remembering or contemplating an immoral act, people wash their hands more than other people, and they place a lot of emphasis on hand washing.
Furthermore, people who wash their hands after such thoughts are less likely to participate in other "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions also recommend hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. using soapless water to wash hands, is characteristic of many religions: for example, the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Judaism in Twila, Nithil Yadeem, Lahab-e-Isha'i and Wazu Islam.
Hand washing after using a toilet is a requirement in Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Managing workplace risks for COVID-19
Workplace risk management for COVID-19 refers to implementing occupational safety and health measures to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate control of workplace risks depends on the workplace and the nature of the work, the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and among workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing etiquette, and keeping the work environment clean and disinfected.
Medium-risk occupations are those that are in contact with people who are not known to have been infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by social transmission and international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, work environments in densely populated areas and a large number of retail locations.
Basic infection prevention measures for this knot, in addition to risk management, include high-performance air filters for air circulation, protection against sneezing, and personal protective equipment if exposed to a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers exposure of health care and mortuary workers to a person with or suspected of COVID-19 to be a higher risk, with a higher exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect or handle samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 person.
These workers will need to take appropriate risk control measures, such as negative air circulation pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment that is appropriate to the nature of the work.
There are many possible effects of a COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace.
Workers may be absent due to the risk of getting sick, the safety of others, or fear of being exposed to illness.
The patterns of trade can change, both in terms of demand for goods and in terms of the supply of those goods (such as shopping at low-peak times, or delivery or drive-through facilities).
Finally, geographically disrupted orders from areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be used to guide preventive actions.
The plans identify the risk levels associated with various workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors generated by home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the control measures and emergency plans for the outbreak situation that are necessary to address these risks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional proposals.
To reduce staff movement for response purposes to an epidemic, to protect those at risk of health complications, and to reduce adverse impacts on business operations and supply chains.
The severity of the disease affects the response in the community where the business is located.
The risk control classification framework is widely used in occupational safety and health, to effectively control group risks.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are established controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
The controls that will be developed are to separate employees from work-related hazards, regardless of their behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control refers to changes in work policies and procedures, which require compliance from the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and management controls, but can help prevent some emergencies.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risks to workers, properly installed, if applicable (e.g., a sounding device), continuously and properly worn, regularly cleaned and replaced, whatever is needed, if removed properly, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure hazard jobs involve minimal professional exposure to the public and other peers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing etiquette including covering the mouth when coughing and sneezing, providing tissues and litter, talking on the phone or arranging rotation if necessary, encouraging workers to use other people's tools and equipment, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Identifying and isolating potentially infectious individuals is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay home until fever, fever symptoms, or other symptoms have passed without fever or other symptom-relieving medications for at least 24 hours, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allowing employees to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk exposures are jobs that require close or continuous contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are suspected or not known to be infected with COVID-19, but the community around the business may be affected by transmission or SARS-CoV-2, or because the individual has recently traveled internationally where there has been mass transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, work environments in densely populated areas and large retail spaces. To control these and more at-risk groups, it includes installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing air circulation rates, physical barriers such as plastic guards to prevent sneezing, and installing drive-through windows to serve customers. Administrative control for these and more high-risk groups will require that sick workers be encouraged to stay at home, change face-to-face meetings to virtual conversations, take turns at work, post regular travel to places where COVID-19 has not been detected, continue to plan for conversations, including using e-mail, providing face masks, providing training, providing personal protective equipment, and providing training and training to workers who want to work in a less or less COVID-19-sensitive work environment, including washing their hands, using protective gear, and taking personal protective measures, and providing training and training to workers who need to know the risks of COVID-19.
The use of respirators is rare among workers in this risk group.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to save crew and other passengers are required, keeping the sick person at least 6 feet away from others, assigning a staff member to the patient, and offering the sick person a face mask or telling the patient to cover his or her mouth and hands with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
When approaching a sick passenger or touching body moisture or potentially contaminated surfaces, flight crew should wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in bags made for this purpose, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk control includes postponing travel in case of illness, and self-isolation and promptly notifying the medical center on board if fever or other symptoms occur.
The CDC recommends short-term closures for schools and child care centers to ensure that if an infected person has been in a school building, even if they have not spread the virus, it is cleaned or disinfected.
When there is mild to moderate transmission of the virus, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or eating at cafeterias, increasing distance between desks, limiting arrival and departure times, avoiding nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant amount of movement in the local community, long-term closure of schools may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.Law enforcement personnel who are carrying out their daily activities are considered to be at low immediate health risk, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers, who are in contact with people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the event, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning sprays or wipes before re-use, and follow standard enforcement procedures for using and disposing of used PPE and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, some health centers and mortuary workers are at high or excessive risk of exposure.
Healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transportation workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients in high-risk exposures.
These become at high risk of exposure when workers undertake aerosol-making operations, or collect or administer samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the aerosol making process, a cavity insertion, cough procedure, examination of the throat cavity, some dental procedures and examinations, or collection of invasive samples.
High-risk jobs in the morgue include workers who prepare cadavers of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional controls that will be put in place, including rooms set aside for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol preparation procedures are followed.
Special negative pressure air circulation devices may be appropriate in some health centers and morgues.
Samples should be handled under biosecurity level 3 safeguards.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in designated waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of a known patient or suspected SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-producing operations.
NIOSH-approved N95 filtered respirators or better should be used in light of a comprehensive and written safety respiratory program in the United States, which includes appropriate testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve worker comfort.WHO does not recommend full coverage, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and not transmitted through body moisture.
WHO recommends surgical masks only at entry screening sites for staff.
For individuals who are collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-making procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or face shields, gowns and gloves.
If an aerosol-making procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced by N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Recognizing that global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, allowing only those who are directly caring for a COVID-19 patient to enter the room, using PPE for specific tasks, using the same respirator without lowering while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and managing the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

Subject: [Covid-19] Lose weight and prepare for the future
This is a very good example of how to do this.
License: CC0:: Not subject to copyright
We're in for a wild ride this month.
The global COVID-19 pandemic is one that has made it clear that humans are globally connected and we have responsibilities to one another.
We have no precedent for this kind of challenge, but we know very well that our best response is global empathy, cooperation, and community building that is the very spirit of this institution.
The sense of camaraderie and attention that we've seen in all of our peers in email, phone calls and chat, all of it is a testament to how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to have you all as my fellow travelers.
Last week, someone complimented me on our work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is for this fragile resource that is available online to everyone.
Your work has made this possible, whether you're with sites or our peers who are paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs information, and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
It's the moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some major changes to how we work together starting this coming week.
We were able to work in the field ministry for about two years.
As Robyn expressed earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what would be the most appropriate response to what we were facing and how to keep the organization on its feet in the meantime.
With all our heart, we wanted to take the long-term stress out of our mission.
If you want to dial, fine.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily work expectations would be about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, so to speak.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you can work normal hours, the mission can put you to use.
However, nothing can be said about the world right now, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a bargain, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
We don't have to say it, but we're saying it.
No sick days or PTO requirements - just tell your manager and help your team re-create their calendar and schedule, making sure all aspects of the job are done.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, notify Bryan within T&C Ops, so T&C can assist with support and ensure that your situation is appropriately addressed by the administration.)
Friends who work by the hour will be paid in full.
We've said this before, and we're saying it again, to our contractors and our hourly staff, as we pass on our responsibilities.
Each person will be paid according to the hours they spent in normal circumstances.
This includes if you are ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people work in the world around them to change their stress.
What we can do is incredibly useful, especially on days like this.
Again, this is all for your personal safety.
We're just saying talk to your manager, and we'll figure out what to expect from you and then we'll make things accordingly.
A task is considered essential.
There are some things we should keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (among others) do hard work, which may require additional support.
We're reviewing recent goals with all departments and supporting what's essential to our mission, shifting our focus.
We all have so much to do, we're all just going to focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us later.
We're not planning to "get it done" once this pandemic is over.
You're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines, which is unrealistic at the moment.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and where appropriate we will work to set new goals and timelines.
What is the purpose of the annual budget?
To set our new reality and expectations for daily working hours, we intend to set up our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to expand our 2019-2020 plan, which takes longer to budget, to allow workers to change their work priorities, and to see their loved ones in a position to accommodate those in need who want to work less.
This time extension will greatly reduce the current planning work and pressure across the organization.
We will present our plan to the board next week and inform delegates and teams of our next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you for leading the app team on this.
Official status, appearance, and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that one of our friends in SF may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, despite extreme caution, we have outsourced staff to our San Francisco office for an anti-virus operation to clean up all surfaces.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant to clean every surface of the blast furnace and the stairs leading to our roof.
This building is using its own surveillance protocol products that keep the safety of its tenants in mind.
We feel relieved that the office will be ready to go by the time we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with all DC office staff and us.
Just last week, our D.C. office moved to a remote location that is in line with our shared guidelines with San Francisco.
As some of us in New York City know, we're also renting a place in Brooklyn.
These talks are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
Our old friends know that this could be some adjustment and they want to give you some advice.
The length of the meetings can be extended to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer seats are needed, think about how to divide them up into different days.
Make each meeting an agenda, and send out the reading material first.
Make video the default, so you can use features like Google Docs and Zoom for live collaboration and communication.
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, with someone monitoring the discussion for questions and following up on the list of speakers and someone helping to take notes (or collaborate on notes).
If you need a comfy headset, email support.
Use your welfare payments for snacks.
Join the #RemoteWork channel on Slack to talk about shared work with your colleagues.
The HR Operations Team is considering webinar-based ergonomics guidance to collaborate in distributed work throughout the foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients of social incentives to cancel Wikimedia-privileged public events, such as Edidethans, until the World Health Organization declares the pandemic over.
They should know that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it possible to complete their agreed cooperation activities and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down these objectives.
In the coming weeks we will be following additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment of the entire global community is saddened by the disruption but satisfied with the clear ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
Going forward, CRT is working on a webpage on MetaWiki to provide the community with a platform to track their interactions and monitor their impact.
Stay in touch with COVID-19-related cases.
We'll send you an invitation to a special meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll use this time to share updates, answer your questions, and spend some time keeping in touch.
We're in this together, and we're gonna help each other out as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information from this email and other relevant information about COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT This page will keep all the latest and other information in one place.
We are working to maintain regular contact with staff members who are currently living in countries that are severely affected.
If you have a travel, event, important work schedule, or coverage challenge or anything else that you need help with, please feel free to work with CRT and get updates.
We are here to provide support and liaison when needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, please email Brian Jordan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a waiver of our duties and responsibilities.
They are an identity at this moment, our work and our responsibilities will need to be scaled up in a way that we have never seen before.
These are the initiatives that we believe are essential in helping each other so that we can continue to work, to give our movement the support it needs and the service to the world it depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be there waiting for us.
From now on, it's time to help each other and take time off for important work that will come in the next few weeks, possibly months.
We need all of you to do this, and that's why it's important that you all take care of yourselves and your families so that you're in the best shape of your ability to be ready when the need arises.
Now, please, keep your hands to yourself and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J. Dorian D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L, Lint L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the team leadership (Grant I, Heather W, Jim V, Gemini U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-B-enzyme-converting 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 is a competitor of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the amount of angiotensin (1-7) making it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point for coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc-containing metalonzyme found on the surface of endothelial cells and in the rest of the cell.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its activated domain expressed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
The domain outside the cells of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shadesase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream which is eventually excreted through the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with type II cells of the lung, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the outer membrane of the brain, the body cavity, from the little finger down to the elbow, the brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE contrast balance.
ACE increases the hormone angiotensin I in the closed blood vessels of angiotensin II.
In turn ACE2 carboxyl terminates by separating the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzing it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides including [des-arg-9]-bradiquinone, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the membrane transport of the natural amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in brain dementia.
As a protein transcription factor, ACE2 acts as the main mediator in the cells of a few coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (a virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the restriction of fluctuations on the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 causes the membrane contents of a cell to swallow inward and both the virus and the enzyme to migrate within the cells.
This intervention process also requires the prioritization of the protein S by the representative serine protease TMPRSS2, which is still under investigation as a potential treatment. This has led some to conclude that decreased ACE2 levels in cells may make it easier to fight off the disease.
However, several professional societies and organizations have advised against continuing conventional ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and cardiac arrest.
ACEs were also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human transplants of ACE2 (rhACE2) are being promoted as a novel treatment for severe hip injury, and it appeared that it would improve hemodynamics and oxygen supply with a lipopolysaccharide-dependent severe respiratory distress symptom.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes, except for the 24-hour effect (duration).
Several results suggest that rhACE2 may be a superior drug for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in diseases where angiotensin II circulation is high - elevated concentrations of rhACE2 have been diagnosed during clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile applications that help keep in touch during the 2019-20 global coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who have been in contact with an infected person.
Several such applications have been created or proposed in several regions and constituencies in collaboration with the government.
Several application frameworks have been developed to find contacts.
Privacy concerns were raised, particularly about the system that allows the app user's geolocation to be tracked.
A low-intrusion alternative involves using Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location to another mobile phone.
Google and Apple jointly announced on April 10, 2020 that they would collaborate on integrating these types of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with AliPay, has created an app that allows citizens to track whether they have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
They are used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called Trace Together is being used.
The app was created by a local IT community, released as an independent resource and will be referred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" that can detect proximity to potentially infected people and provide immediate response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the contact tracing app is in the next stage of development and will be available for launch within a week - similar applications ("Stop COVID") are also planned in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering developing apps based on Singapore's Trace Together app and the Bluetress protocol - Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, to ensure people don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has identified several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including the possibility of false positives and low effectiveness, if the application is restricted to a small segment of the population.
Overcoming concerns about the spread of fake or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, restricting them to only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the countless surveillance restrictions on the coronavirus app, particularly whether the surveillance arrangements put in place to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed even after the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance arrangements.
These agencies have announced eight conditions on government projects:
Surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The extension of surveillance and observation should be for a specific period:
Data use will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19 only;
Data protection and anonymity shall be protected and evidence-based protection shall be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance must be avoided by over-discrimination and under-importance;
Data sharing with a third party must be made clear under the law;
Precautions must be taken against abuse and citizens have the right to respond to abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders" will need meaningful participation, including public health experts and non-core groups. The German CCS Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter Oehn Grünzen (RSF) also issued watchlists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of constant monitoring by removing surveillance mechanisms from your operating system device when it is no longer needed.
Some countries used a network-based palace surveillance system instead of an app, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid surveillance.
A network-based surveillance system was adopted in Israel.
Network-based solutions, which have access to the raw data of the chance palace, are likely to have significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems connected to central servers require access to personal occasion data; several privacy protection systems have also been created that use only central servers to notify each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a best-of-breed application, the system collected surveillance information from a variety of sources including surveillance data on a mobile device and data from a card exchange, and combined all of that to generate notifications via text messages for potentially affected individuals.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the information publicly available to inform potential contacts, something that was allowed due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws at the time the MERS outbreak hit the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries such as Germany have also considered both centralized and privacy protection systems.
Details were not released until April 6, 2020.
Privacy-protected contact monitoring is an improved concept, with a substantial history of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that allows a user to enter the palace from another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes: decentralized privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, FKA event contact numbers, CEN), sensitive privacy protocol and mobile contact procedure (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all matches are on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing Secure Routes, a platform for using privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The white paper is based on research by "Apps Go Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in a Pandemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace Platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by a group of groups who came together with the goal of sharing a common vision and largely violating protocols, to reduce dispersed shirazes in order to enable surveillance and warning apps as a global mutual capability, a key aspect of achieving mass adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the application used by their government, the Bluetress application, open source.
On April 10, 2020, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, Google and Apple, announced a move to contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and protection of privacy encryption.
They also published specifications for the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three phases:
Implementation of these protocols will enable governments to launch government privacy protection applications to detect coronavirus.
By directly integrating this functionality into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address this persistent monitoring issue by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in the same manner when the threat is eliminated.
Drug replacement (also called drug re-purposing, re-profiling, re-use, or re-treatment) is the use of a drug approved to treat a disease to change or re-use the medical condition of another disease rather than the disease for which it was originally developed.
It is an online scientific research that is currently underway to research an effective and safe treatment for COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of robust plasma.SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug-like proteins, each with multiple inhibition sites.
Analysis of these staining sites provides a suitable plan to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most prominent target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are poppyseed-like, RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helices, S-proteins and ADP ribo-phosphate, proteins.
Hussain A.A., et al. studied several candidate compounds, which were then refined and analyzed with the highest approved drugs for structural similarity to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in a preclinical study, to be proposed in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used for some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its seven hydrochloroquines would be among four drugs to be studied in collaborative clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York's official trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, FDR authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trial procedures and is only authorized for emergency use under the EIA for patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 disease" has not yet been determined.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a short study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the precautionary use of hydrochlorothiazines.
Experiments by China in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that faviprovir was "clearly" effective.
In Shenzhen, an average of 35 patients tested negative in four days, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not take the drug was 11 days.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half were given yomifenoir.

It may not be safe for use in pregnant women or those attempting to become pregnant.
A study of lupinavir/retinavir (Cleitra), a combination of antiviral lupinavir and retinavir, concluded that "no benefit was seen".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from binding to proteases and replicating.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism in the scientific community for turning resources toward regenerative drugs, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/retinavir in an international cohesion trial.
Remdesivir was developed and promoted by Glade Science to prevent Ebola virus disease and treat Marburg virus disease - subsequent Glade Science quickly discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity against a number of phyllo-, phaeomo-, paramexo- and coronaviruses in vitro.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the promotion of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several such clinical trials, including two administered by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild disease and another for people with severe disease, are included.
There are three intravenous clinical trials of vitamin C for patients with severe COVID-19 disease who are hospitalized; two sedative-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, all scientific attention has been focused on recreating approved antiviral drugs such as those developed during the first emerging MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus outbreaks.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines.
U-Mefenvir: Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines.
Some antibiotics that have been potentially re-usable for the treatment of COVID-19:
Toxizomab (Anti-ILL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China.
The BA COVID-19 vaccine is a placebo vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine to be developed for SARS-CoV-2, a causative virus that would be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major pandemic broke out worldwide, which led to significant investment and research in the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using advertised lonesome substances to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CAP's necessary steps to develop the vaccine are rapid, with manufacturers' capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms are under research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I safety studies include several major platform objectives:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: EarSinobiologics, Adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 have been announced but little public information is available about them (believed to be in the planning stages or still being designed).
Phase I-II trials are early safety and immunity assessments, usually randomized, drug-controlled, and multi-site, while setting more precise, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at higher doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (both certified as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet diagnosable in humans (yet in "preclinical" research).

In France on 19 March 2020, the Alliance for the Innovative Manufacturing of Epidemiological Diseases (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium comprising the Pasteur Institute, Thames Biosciences (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of COVID-19 vaccines to US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Corewalk, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of four different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-developing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving an order from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on COVID-19 anti-knee response medicine, including several vaccine candidates in initiatives by Canadian companies and universities, such as MedicaGo and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Government of Canada announced C$192 million exclusively for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, with several new vaccines planned to be used in a national "vaccine bank" to be used in the event of a second coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Petersbridge University School of Medicine reported experiments on pathocyanin, which may be a potential COVID-19 virus in rats, stating that "MNA demonstrated a strong antigen-related antibody response [in rats] to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine that was clearly evident 2 weeks after vaccination".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced that it was designing a DNA-based vaccine as a potential nasal spray.

In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled resources to gain access to IBM's supercomputers, which will be pooled with the cloud computing resources of HelloWorked Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits in addition to the disease they want to avoid.
4,170 medical observers are being enrolled in another randomized trial in Australia.
It is possible that a vaccine will not be safe or effective in the developmental stages.
Early research to test vaccine efficacy using specific animal samples of COVID-19, such as ACE2-resistant rats, other laboratory animals and non-human superior organisms, indicates the need for international coordination to ensure biosecurity level 3 measures to directly address the virus, and standardised protection procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS had been discovered that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions worldwide.
When MERS first emerged, it was believed that current SARS research would be a useful model for developing treatments and vaccines against MERS-CoV disease.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were ongoing, all of which were vectorized viral vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectorized (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and a vaccine is already available.
Patents appearing in various social media posts point to current patents on genetic sequences and vaccines and other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, menstrual diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
It usually takes five days from onset to onset of symptoms but can last from two to 14 days.
Although most cases are mild in nature, some cases go on to viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered - the virus is mainly transmitted from person to person in the public through close contact, often in the form of saliva droplets when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although similar droplets are also released when exhaling, they often fall to the ground or floor, instead of spreading disease over long distances.
People can also get the disease by rubbing their hands on their eyes, nose or mouth after touching an infected surface.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious within three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is also possible to spread during the pre- and post-symptomatic stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is time-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on whey in human infants.
Masks are recommended for people who are suspected of having the virus and for healthcare professionals.
The proposal for masks for the general public is controversial, with some officials opposing, some recommending and some declaring them necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or may have cold-like symptoms such as fever, cough, cough and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, recurrent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may also be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
In China, a few cases were initially reported with only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to four days but can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The status of these asymptomatic infected people is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be carriers.
The proportion of people infected with the disease who are currently asymptomatic is unknown and is being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital stays were asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 infected patients on that day were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both the spleen and the spleen can have an excess viral load.
Talking out loud produces more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that drops of untreated cahansi have the ability to go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that biosolid transmission may be possible and samples of viral RNA have been found positive in air collectors in hallways outside people's rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolize respiratory fluids and consequently disperse them into the air.
While there are now concerns that it spreads through waste, the risk is considered low; the virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; and if it is possible to spread the virus before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three people.The virus can survive on different surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be viable for one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel ((AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper.
However, it varies with humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are effective if used correctly; soap products deactivate the virus's protective layer of grease, as well as clearing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents, such as benzocoum chloride and chlorohazidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken within an average of two days of admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe respiratory distress symptoms Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe novel respiratory disease coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan in three people with severe respiratory illness with pneumonia.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in nature in the corresponding coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which ruptures its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 as the virus accesses these host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II lymphocytic cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special layer of sugar called a "cell" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
A severe heart wound was found in 12% of patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is common in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are more common due to inflammation throughout the body and immune system diseases during disease progression, but severe heart muscle injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors.
2ACEs are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
Increased incidences of arterial blood clots (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) were seen in ICU patients affected by COVID-19 and may be related to poor diagnosis.Postmortems of those who died from COVID-19 showed lung lung lung damage (LDL) and lymphocytes containing inflammatory penetration.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a predisposition to the appearance of ACE2 airway surface cells, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of excessive inflammation affecting the body.
In particular, the use of suzygi IL-6-excreting monocytes and association with severe pulmonary disease in patients with COVID-19 with pathogenic SM-CSF-secreting T-cells was observed.
There have also been reports of lymphocyte interference at post-mortem.
The WHO has published several methods for testing the disease.
The standard method of experiments is time-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath moisture samples obtained from nasal mucus; however, nasal mucus or saliva samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two samples in two weeks and the immediate significance of the results is less.
Chinese scientists have isolated a variant of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infectious disease caused by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which detect active infectious disease and whether a person has been infected in the past) were still in the development stages, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test experiment showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The FDA approved the first test center of the care for use in the United States at the end of the month on March 21, 2020. The Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University issued diagnostic guidelines for detecting the outbreak, taking into account clinical features and epidemic risk.
Bi-directional polycythemia, ground glass opossum with enveloped, inadequate and subsequently divided opacity is common in early infection.
As the disease progresses, complete absorption, crazies may appear and stability.
Some statistics are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main autopsy findings are:
Macroscopy: Inflammation of the lung membrane, inflammation of the heart wall, stability of the lungs and swelling of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, overgrowth of the pneumocytes, large abnormal pneumocytes, ruptured inflammation with lymphocytic penetration and formation of polycytic giant cells.
Acute pneumonia: Decreased skin loss (DAD) with decreased skin swelling.
DA causes the appearance of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe oxygen deprivation in the body.
Pneumonia recovery: organization of expulsion in the alular cavity and pulmonary bicuvala membrane
Blood: Blood clots in the veins (DIC); white and red blood cells respond.
Precautions to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding unwashed hands from touching eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings in crowds, to limit the spread of the virus from asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with large groups of infected individuals by closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
Effective treatments for COVID-19 have not been discovered. Since vaccines are not expected until before 2021, a key point in managing COVID-19 is to reduce the peak levels of the epidemic called "flattering the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are obviously dirty, before eating and after rinsing, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO develops two formulas for local production.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity is generated from ethanol and isopropanol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help kill bacteria eggs; it is "not an active agent for pathogens in the hands".
Glycerol is added as a solvent.
People are managed with supportive care, including fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other critical organ support.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Intracytoplasmic membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory obstruction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and improved diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care can be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the epidemic.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, trauma and lung doctors have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts recommend paracetamol (methaminophen) as the main drug to replace ibuprofen.
Precautions are necessary to minimize the risk of virus spread, especially in a medical setting when a medical procedure involving a blowhole, such as an intravenous line or hand ventilation, is being performed.
For medical personnel caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be kept in an Airborne Infection Room (AIIR) in addition to general precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for airborne germs.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Respirators are preferred (instead of face masks) when available.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial use but the FDA has only authorized the mask for emergency use under the EUA.
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but their effectiveness against a particular unapproved biological agent is not guaranteed.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or homemade masks, as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 often do not deteriorate to the point of requiring a biopsy or replacement, but a small percentage of patients do.
The type of respiratory support in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied, with some evidence that high-flow nasal cannulae or an intravenous duct with bilateral positive airway pressure can be avoided.
It is not known whether any of these have the same benefits for people with chronic illness.
Some doctors prefer invasive machine vision when available because this procedure limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe disease is more common in older adults (in those over 60 years of age and especially in those over 80 years of age).
Per capita beds are not available in developed countries, limiting the health system's ability to handle the surge in COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
One study found that 5% were admitted to the intensive care unit in China, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% were fatal.
30% of people infected with COVID-19 in China are eventually admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as COVID-19 increases acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure-controlled modes and high PEEP-capable ventilators are needed to maximize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung damage and chest air clots associated with ventilators.
More PEEP would not be available on older ventilators.
Research for a potential treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to become available, several drugs undergoing trials are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced trials.
Antiviral medications may be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has authorized the experimental use of artificially recovered plasma in cases where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not passed clinical trials to prove itself safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can use surveillance data to identify "close contacts" and therefore the potential risk of infection.
Each user can see the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local medical officials. It uses mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and big data analytics on artificial intelligence to track down infected people and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who may have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom collaborated with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to conduct research and distribute collected mobile phone location data to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
The Italian regional health administrator said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still walking around".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with 42,000 candidates.
Estonia's President Kristi Kjolyud also called for an international call for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Excessive social distancing, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic hardship are a complete disaster for people's mental health and well-being".
The disease can be mild with few or no symptoms, which is similar to other common respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
In general, normal patients recover in two weeks, while patients with severe or severe illnesses recover in three to six weeks.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may also be at high risk of COVID-19, but data for COVID-19 are not available.
In severely infected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly transform into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to respiratory failure, body decomposition or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body rot, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
An abnormal blood clot, specifically in 6% of COVID-19 patients, was found to have a longer duration of hyperglycemia, while kidney failure was seen in 4% of patients in this group.
About 20-30% of people affected by COVID-19 had an excess of transaminases.
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in the hospital.
However, the median time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the ICU was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median time from onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full range was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
A postmortem lung medical examination showed widespread damage to the air in the lungs with the release of cellulose fibromyzoid into small sacs for air.
Changes related to disease of living viral cells have been observed in pneumocystis.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8% of deaths were due to elevated levels of trabeponin or cardiac activation.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing conditions.The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic conditions in the region may also influence mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality vary due to regional variations, but it can also be due to difficulties in the methodology.
Low overall patient counts can lead to high mortality rates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of diseases that were already present means that current mortality rates are underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death rates than nonsmokers.
Hong Kong hospital administration saw a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of symptoms in intensive care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known to cause long-term immunity in people recovering from past pandemics.
Immunity is seen as a potential based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported in which positive results for coronavirus have returned after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worsened by a long-lasting infection rather than a recurrent infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and to have originated as an animal-borne disease.
Its exact source is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, shows that the earliest case of symptom onset occurred on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported 8 December 2019 as the earliest date of the outbreak.
Several steps are usually taken to determine the emirate.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health systems, treatment options, the time from the beginning of the outbreak to the present and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health factors.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and U07.2 to clinical or epidemic deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global death-to-incidence ratio as of 17 April 2020 is currently 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number of cases varies by region. Other measures include mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among confirmed individuals, and epidemic mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among infected individuals (confirmed and unconfirmed).
These statistics are not of a specific time and cover a specific population from disease to case resolution.
Although not all infected individuals show antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people are infected.
A small village of 4,600 inhabitants, Castelliglione d'Adda, at the centre of the epidemic in Italy, where 80 (1.7%) people have already died.
In Ganglet, the spread of the disease was due to Catholic Christian festivals, and spread to younger people, which caused a relatively low mortality rate, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 were classified in this way.
Moreover, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as measured from blood donors.
69 (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rates of the pandemic differ between men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have higher mortality rates among men.
The greatest risk in men occurs after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women only ends at 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this sex difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Sex-based immunological variations, lower smoking rates in women and men, and higher rates of other diseases in men than in women, such as high blood pressure at a younger age, may increase mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking gender-related statistics for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A large percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO President Teterros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that KCO refers to coronavirus, VI to virus, D to disease, and 19 refers to the day when the first case occurred: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named SARS-CoV-2.
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the early outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as interim names for the virus and disease, in line with a 2015 directive against using place names in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are pushing medical devices such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the vendor couldn't deliver it on time, a local craftsman replicated it and made the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misconceptions about the onset, duration, prevention, treatment and other measures of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Some humans can spread viruses to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral growth in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "solidarity trials" to evaluate the effects of treatment with the four most effective existing antiviral compounds.
No vaccine is available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the same means to enter human cells using ACE2.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactivated or dead, to develop an immediate immune response in the human body against the novel disease of COVID-19.
Another strategy, subcomponent vaccines, aimed at developing a vaccine that would make the immune system sensitive to some subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the focus of such research is on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme pathway.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, novel method of vaccine development).
The experimental vaccines developed from these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy - the first clinical trial of the vaccine was launched on March 16, 2020 in Seattle on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code that was copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancers have been suggested as a potential challenge in vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven trials were testing a drug that is already approved for treatment of malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research involves the re-prescribed antiviral drug, with reports of nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir in several countries expected by the end of April.
As of April 2020, active evaluation for candidates for COVID-19 vaccine development and use was underway. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are under investigation, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/retinoir and lopinavir/retinoir synthesized in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy from remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with reduced use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of research.
The Korean and Chinese medical administrations recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that doubling the dose of the drug can be extremely dangerous and fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for physicians who are engaged in the treatment of COVID-19 patients to use their discretionary prehydrochlorothiazines and chloroquine.The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines includes interferon, ribavirin or omnifenovir as the medicines used against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of robavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitasaxanide has been recommended for further vet studies after demonstrating low concentration in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early tip-like lipid priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry into SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have major barriers to study with or without azithromycin which have prevented the medical community from accepting the treatment without further study. Ozoltumor does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of OVID-19.
Cytokine stroma can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine is characteristic of anticytoquinestrome. Tosylisumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after completing a brief study.
Italy is undergoing a nationwide Phase 2 randomized trial after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
The common serum ferritin blood test to identify cytosine kinase, aimed at countering such developments, is thought to cause death in some infected individuals.
In 2017, the FDA approved the steroidal refractory cytokine release disorder for treatment of a different cause, called CART cell therapy, based on past studies of the method.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosylzeumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Clean and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 disease, transferred to those who need it, are being investigated as a passive immunization vaccine for a deactivated vaccine.
This strategy was tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is a predicted mechanism by which passive antibody therapy may lead to defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other cases of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of induced monoclonal antibodies, are being worked on.
Production of robust fluid, the liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and containing specific antibodies to the virus, could be prepared for early use.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenling, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
