A Republican strategy to oppose Obama's reelection
The Republican leadership justifies its policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, affirming that voter fraud in the United States is less common than the number of people killed by lightning.
By the way, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting state elections.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have enacted new laws since 2009 that make the process of registering or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time limits for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and deprive citizens of the right to vote for which a court record is in place.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that would force voters to show photo IDs.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of the American people, 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, it is often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with incomes of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are considered to be voters, who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who are more Republican-leaning to use the cards issued by those clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Because it's obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in eight states in 2011 pushed for laws abolishing voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections helped to register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% decrease in the share of registered voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the early voters were African-American, despite making up only 13% of the state's electorate.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, made up only 46% of the early voters.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the passed laws and see in them a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results, with false negatives or false positives, leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater reluctance on the part of men who are already undecided to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We've got two doctors who are experts.
The studies in the USA showed a large number of interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients with and without early diagnosis.
This study also showed that, at 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection is performed.
So I recommend testing at age 50, or 40 if you have a close relative who has had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once cancer is diagnosed.
There are some cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made to understand the extent of his risk of cancer by showing him the possible options for which prostate cancer can go untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, he is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their life.
They are advised to be actively monitored and offered treatment if the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not are being set with increasing precision.
That's why I still recommend the test.
Most important, though, is to talk to your doctor about whether or not you should have it.
Movember, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, has developed an instrument to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite the advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It's estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and got enough exercise.
"If there were no smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%", stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unresolved.
The Canadian Cancer Society continues to make the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It's also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is bad for people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", laments spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease outbreak.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer", he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing colorectal or breast cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer", he explains.
Other
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But their research is inconclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family's pre-burden.
"Running an early detection test does not lead to cancer".
The Higgs boson is being analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it's the last particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model -- our best or "least false" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but has not been empirically observed.
But physicists are not entirely sure that it's really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure.
Let's assume that it's the Higgs, because there's a very small risk of being wrong, and let's see what it's all about.
There is a law in this world that is inevitably unavoidable, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don't try too hard, because you will hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also has a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", which "state" consists largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, known as Fermions, who politely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil gang of anarchists who hold nothing sacred -- certainly not this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the Berkeley Labs website The Particle Adventure (which is absolutely amazing, by the way), are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we won't discuss here, and the "force particles" that propagate the great forces of nature, to which the Higgs boson would be related in some way.
But it's important to note that these bosons aren't all as exotic as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only because of a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or "light particle", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" at that very spot, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carrying the force".
Stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disrupted" for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shattered by a very large rock.
So you need a giant particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a radius of 27 kilometers! - to reach these energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
It's not really all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field equally: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all this research be "good for", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they serve to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine precisely any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, many physicists who are eager to find such discrepancies, since the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter has still major flaws, since it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups again!).
However, such discrepancies have not been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser at Bell Labs never imagined that their work would spark such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser in 1962 -- the first pulsed ones -- told us that the laser was initially seen as more of a "laboratory toy".
I mean, imagine what...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle, while working in optics, developed a small light sensor.
Although not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras around the world, and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know.
Palliative care is the best way to die.
With its Committee on Dying with Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look into this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate, which had consumed him, had given him two years to live.
"You gave me five years to live, I've made it seven", he said halfheartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"It's always a shock, though, and you can't be prepared for it", he says.
The disease is doing its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at a table for a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped with the meal.
He even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bringing him his medication, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to have my diarrhea cured, because it is humiliating", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man urinates standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois Home.
For some people, returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to take a step back, he notes.
Because, according to several people who work in palliative care, big events are happening in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home all have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the so-called "healing" care of the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is "to die consciously and by suffocation".
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more desires in life", she says before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still expecting a final visit from her son, who is coming from Italy, in the next few days.
The Victor-Gadbois home offers a group of volunteers to help with body care and food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is one bed for palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's not much, considering that one day we're all going to die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Both in terms of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given a mouthwash with brandy or Pepsi, depending on his wish.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, and he died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both family members and patients", reports Nathalie Savard, director of care.
There's no day like the next at Victor-Gadbois.
Next to a 93-year-old man enjoying the last family gathering in the yard, well supported by his pillow as his honour is stomped, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months now, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age", says Dr. Christiane Martel, worried.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois Home come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients at the end of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this major deficiency in Quebec's health care system that has caused several palliative care doctors to be concerned about the passage of a law regulating assisted dying and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, expressing their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not capable of ensuring that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting the transition to assisted dying.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain, with no relief measures taken.
I'm afraid the only reason patients want to die is because they don't get proper health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are treating their patients to the very last day despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already slim when she stopped a grueling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
She told me I was finished!
Not omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not granting their wish after their pain was relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be made clear that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which involves putting the patient into a coma either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the option of using this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep", but "I want my pain to be relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale property scandal in Quebec
Every day officials of the road commission, construction companies, political party funders and specialists in the Italian mafia tell what they know about a great "system" in which construction, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are involved.
An industry which was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has been falling apart since the drastic measures were taken", jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec legislator and former police chief in Montreal.
The scandal was uncovered by him as a result of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secretive party financing and bribes to officials.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010", he points out, "the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", because some have tamed their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping it will succeed in "exposing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was established in 2011, is also making a major effort with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Moreover, the police of the "Marteau squad", which since 2009 has made the "Sewage Cartel" of Montreal more restrained in the artificial inflation of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted a series of house searches and indictments of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Specifically, the charges were brought against engineers from the Montreal Road Authority and Italian entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission how the 'system' for receiving public contracts works.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked broker who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in everything in the 2000s, giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to having organised illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: over a period of ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, and bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he inflated artificially.
Other officials at the Highway Department admitted that they had been tricked into artificially inflating the bills with false surcharges by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer for the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of the Montreal legislature to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has been opposed to the sale of a municipal land that was purchased for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market since 2010.
70% of black money in election campaigns
She says that the study that is eventually conducted "puts a thread in the ground that will allow us to understand the workings of the system that ants are pervading, to stop the evil and to find the culprits".
She says the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigation unit and supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "the officials who are involved in the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in financing Quebec's election campaigns, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a faint reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, which it says would not change the situation: "Until campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in politics".
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public procurement and party financing: "We cannot go any lower; by courageously going to the bottom of things, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and legislation".
If this story damages the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken PSG to a new level.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I'm making progress every day at her side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements are what motivate me every day to improve my playing ability.
And in a game, it's even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I'm not bursting with enthusiasm.
From my early days at the INF Clairefontaine Preparatory Training Centre to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed gradually.
They are thus taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers this summer are used to playing games of a very high standard.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to face up and give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He's supported by co-coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course I did.
Ancelotti instills respect in all the technicians.
There is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken our place as the top-ranked team.
We're in the middle of an ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, which is how we qualified for the last eight.
What is the purpose of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have to make our case against very good European teams.
First, we want to be first in our group before Porto so we can play the rematch of the eighth-place game at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
The financial resources of the PSG are available to make this project a reality.
Would it be a big failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as happened last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to carry the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you're supposed to be champion with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even better season.
I think this year is the year.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Given what's been invested and the players we have, it's normal that a lot is expected of us.
We accept that completely.
But if we win 4-0 at home to Troyes and you still find something to blame on us, that's sure to be a little frustrating.
You wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to come up with a game concept.
A team builds over time.
We showed strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has failed to qualify for the last two seasons and has also spent enormous sums!
In terms of the sums invested, you were believed to be ahead by 15 points at halftime!
That would mean ignoring our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much so, that they're calling it a "Zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came and he's proving he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he's played, he's shown that he's a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their playing level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, is also making it possible for everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
I was very keen to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from playing out some time.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must show exemplary conduct.
What do you think of the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the helm of the Blues?
He has achieved promising results.
We're in a good position in the World Cup qualifying group.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championships.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the forced draw (1:1) in Spain on 16 October a prelude to the game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before that meeting in Spain, I had never seen a match like it in my career.
Bitcoin makes it possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between participants.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After hitting a high of $30 (€23) in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" used to advance in a video game, which can be won or bought (and sometimes exchanged back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, the trading is controlled and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all nodes are simultaneously account book keepers, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
The difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file also makes it possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done by a mathematical problem that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this extra line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers take the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is hacked.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would alter the fingerprint.
If a user tries to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the puzzle gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be halved periodically, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but it is divisible by one hundredth of a million, which leaves some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task increases with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has had its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the protocol itself", assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, are accepting them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-closing sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system Paytunia is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which is cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers, who do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply need to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards a rethinking of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB's report, incidentally, envisages reassessing the various risks which are now considered high in the event of a success of this currency.
We've been out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan farmers in particular by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 dead soldiers, as well as the wounded and disabled.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajik have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will not be around as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base at Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees and financed by French loans, was carried out properly.
The convoys of trucks and tanks overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
By the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible march from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was covered in war due to the fighting of the various insurgent groups.
Their seizure of power was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen by seizing government land to sell as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and thus benefited from massive American subcontracting.
They have become disreputable, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that isn't made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as do those who have benefited from the American grants: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are sick of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of girls and boys.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community, but it has decided to make a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series depicting a modern world is everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization like the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning dams are not in place and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Private initiative is given priority.
In a country ravaged by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on the ground or without transport for export via the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, have international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavating the huge Buddhist site, and remain the province's main employers.
It will also be necessary one day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' and boys' secondary schools, French language institute at universities, French institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable works and agricultural rehabilitation measures in dozens of mountain villages and has had a small French NGO carry out them in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, which required large numbers of local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and increased agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after spending two billion euros on the military?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at altitudes of more than 2000 metres.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
The farmers' desire to get rid of the insurgency led by foreign groups, which they themselves claim to be their wish, would require the continuation of low, well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid in their favour.
A Constitution with a Brechstag in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, he has decided to put everything on the map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
The President of the Council has given this plenary session two months to complete its work.
Egypt has now been relying for almost two years on a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only caused an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president continues in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law underfoot".
Its proponents assure that it is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text to the Egyptians paragraph by paragraph.
For the president, it's also a way of regaining his public and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote willingly.
The fact that this haste is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited power" is supposed to put an end to the latter after the adoption of the Constitution.
The 85 members of this constituent assembly, who are mostly Islamists, passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the declaration of the constitution in mid-November, they turned away, believing that they had not been able to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
I am not going to go into detail on the matter of the Commission's proposals.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted mostly unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day was expressed in the time of the prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was not going on time.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which has attracted all the attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
The Liberal Group, which regards this as a mere propaganda blow, responds with "hypocrisy".
Because according to them, the Islamization of the constitution is done through other articles.
They are particularly concerned with Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are asked to give their opinion are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy".
The Liberals' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no concrete religious commitment at present.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who were partly trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
It admits, however, 'that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are taken from religious vocabulary.
The reference here is particularly to the "fiqh".
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on this".
The text adopted yesterday is being strongly criticized, apart from its religious aspect, because of the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention is the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the defence budget is not being examined by Parliament but by a national defence council.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the matter.
The latter also express their fears about the text, which they consider a threat to their freedom.
The fact that blasphemy is still a crime and that insults are now prohibited could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article is about women's protection, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the glory of Bible truths, modern comforts, and unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons for visiting Israel.
Worshiping at the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles, turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on water, calming a sea storm, and catching fish.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are in Jerusalem.
The faithful make the way of the Passion or the way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, the Praetorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old City to the Church of the Tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone, and the tomb of Jesus are located.
In Christian view, this is the navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands on the spot where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave wishes behind, which are then fulfilled.
Taking a Trip to the Heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada are the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 A.D.
They lie on a rock face in the mountains, 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else will take an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
The famous Hermon ski resort, located at an altitude of 1,600 to 2,040 meters (1,600 to 2,040 feet), attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain, you can get there by shuttle bus.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were said to live on the mountain top.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
One trip is not enough to see all of them.
But at least five of the most interesting of them should be visited.
One of these is the Israel Museum, near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves in the Judean desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko, you can visit the museum at Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most moving section is the Children's Monument, erected in memory of the 1.5 million children who perished in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, it's completely dark.
The stars are shining.
And it's got the names of the Jewish children and the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Doing Something for Your Health
Israel's three main recreational areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of the three sites has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also used for bathing during the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21°C and the air warms up to 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and bathing is done there year-round.
Incidentally, this unusual sea, at 1,300 feet [417 m] below sea level, is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water is highly saline, so even non-swimmers can easily get to the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for saltwater and saline treatments, as well as for treating skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to soothe tired nerves.
The secrets of antiquity touch
These secrets are kept in the old city of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda here, leading a long and happy life with her.
Tourists like to wander through the narrow lanes, which are named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be the hero of all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries for photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theater and capture the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater now hosts evening concerts and operas.
Tourist shopping list
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
Instead of taking the money in euros, take it in dollars, which can be easily converted into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city, you usually get there by bus, but there is also a high-speed tram in Jerusalem and the only six-station metro line in the country in Haifa, which connects the city centre with the city centre.
It's actually a subway.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a journey of up to 1.5 hours, including transfers.
According to Jewish tradition, Saturday is the Sabbath day in Israel.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transportation is suspended.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
Many cafes, restaurants and taverns serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, shelled fish and food containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of dishes, including ham and beef, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, fried dumplings made with mashed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are plenty of well-fed cats that roam the streets comfortably and unimpeded.
At night, they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
Insurance costs an extra $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States, and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the lifting of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money on language
While MPs and civil rights activists debate the benefits of the mandatory language test law for migrants, criminals are already trading with fake certificates
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their sole aim is to earn money for the support of the families who remained at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring all migrant workers to pass a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
The scheme is currently only applicable to migrants wishing to work in the service sector, in municipal housing and in retail trade.
However, the Federal Migration Agency is planning to make the tests compulsory for all migrant workers in the future.
It is not only language tests, but also tests on Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and for renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The same is true of persons who obtained their diplomas and certificates before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problems and protection of rights
All the examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities, and more than 160 centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
On the other hand, before the law came into force, civil rights activists repeatedly asked the following question in the press: What is the point of the whole thing?
What changes are being made to the requirement to demonstrate language skills, both for Russians and for foreign workers?
The main aim, according to a spokesman for the Migration Agency, is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers", says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency's representation in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without employment, education, language skills and medical advice face problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who will put him in a dark, cramped barracks under the pretext of help, where he will endure for months without food and documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day with dozens of his peers.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home, you are promised the same thing, and when you arrive you are cheated, your passports are taken away and you do not get the promised salary", confirms Tolib Shwaripov, head of the main labour migration department of the Tajik Migration Agency.
Don't you dare call me that, boss!
Yet many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to earn their living in Russia admit that they not only do not speak the language of the country they are going to, but they can hardly express themselves in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the bad: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a decent basic education.
Because their families do not even have the money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize their first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only legal immigrants have to take the test.
If you don't have that status, there's no exam and therefore no official job.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers are still in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "No unauthorized entry".
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and that this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", Tajik Umed Huschkadamov told reporters.
"Just don't be afraid of the costs of fake papers"
The day the law came into force, it became clear that it wasn't just the registration documents of migrants that could be forged.
Some false certificates certifying completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The forged papers were printed with a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for free: Each migrant who hoped to spare himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights experts agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be bought easily.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fail the test for the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Home Office ignores illegal arms trade
Legal weapons very low in crime
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten the gun laws for private gun owners.
This is the response of the authorities to recent events: the shooting at weddings and the killing of seven people in the Moscow murder of lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
Police are proposing to ban nonlethal weapons in public and raise the age for gun ownership from 18 to 21.
The proposal was supported by the Chairperson of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the gun law would be presented to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "pulling the screws".
An open letter has been posted on the Internet, in which the authors - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless escalations".
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very low, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the six months of 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law on private gun ownership will not deter criminals from profiting from the black market.
According to the authors, at present in Moscow you can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The guns are getting onto the black market through multiple channels.
There are five main channels, says former colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting weapons orders
The first channel is the army, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.
On channel two, illegal weapons are being stolen from law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen both from police armories and directly from law enforcement officers.
Other illegal weapons are from military stockpiles.
Explosions were frequent in many military camps.
"There is evidence that in some cases, arson was used to cover up the absence of weapons", says the former military officer.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore dump the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow", reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes by hand, and a mafia that organizes the smuggling", explains the former military man.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in supplying illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all guns on the black market are "the fault of those responsible for their work with guns", says the report.
The researchers found that 17 percent of the weapons were from conflict zones, 14 percent were stolen from the production of weapons, and 5 percent were illegally mined.
A sales consultant at an arms store, who declined to be named, assured that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been discarded because they are outdated.
He says it's more common for dealers to get their supplies from an arms warehouse.
An ensign is used to buy a weapon, such as a TT pistol.
The gun is exhibited and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun into town and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines", he says.
"The police, of course, know everything, so when they cannot follow the crime detection plan, they periodically conduct control purchases from dealers who sell illegal weapons", the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking through websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to the Begowaja station, where a person would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I didn 't know the price of the gun until I was there .
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need someone I know who has contacts", says the salesman. "I have an acquaintance like that, but I don't trust him".
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and make an appointment with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who sends out the message that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm actually getting some leads right now about a guy I know and trust.
He's only supplying me with the rings because he knows I'm not gonna give him a shit.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranez was trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed, he says.
He got a photo album with "anything" in it.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the military man.
According to Baranez, the buyer doesn't get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy, I drive the salesman into the woods, and we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and when I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other", the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show results of websites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No paperwork is required, and there are no face-to-face meetings.
"You just need the right amount of money", says the advertisement on the website "Buy a Rifle or Pistol".
It's where users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", user "Iwan" asks (literal quote).
"Buy a TT Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and gun buyers are flocking to the service.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then end up in Siberia and get to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I've heard of the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The people in charge are taking orders.
The buyer transfers the money through an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the concealment of the weapon", reports the spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end, you can also go empty-handed and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.

"People come like hungry fish to the feeding and then end up in a Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal", he says.
A Makarov for $100
Experts say that illegal firearms can fetch prices of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", a Makarow-type pistol can be purchased for $100 to $300.
You have to wait until a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military armories by mid-level supervisors.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of illegal weapons offences decreased by 7% to 22,9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011 in Russia, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
One in four American teenagers is sitting behind a McDonald's checkout at some point.
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages at Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon run out of air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are aiming to form unions.
Until now, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised by trade unions.
Forty-six cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, when sales in the United States attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to handshakes.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, quit their jobs and joined unions and left-wing activists in striking the chain's branches, which target low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs and milk.
The average price of goods sold at Walmart stores is between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only shop at their workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say that Walmart can often sell the product at such a low price simply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded wage increases and expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford that increase, they said.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if the company raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're giving for wages now.
If Walmart were to pass the wage increases on to customers in full, it would only cost them 46 cents more per purchase in the future.
That would be an extra $12.39 a year for them compared to today.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that protests were held in only nine states and did not result in any losses for the company.
Black Friday ran from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart's cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Company spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview on the left-leaning Huffington Post website that "fewer than five" Walmart employees quit altogether and that the protest was just "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!" That's what I said.
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not aimed at Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city and therefore do not exist), but at McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you're not given sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York state law is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually raising the minimum wage, but not too much, and their average New York City employee earns $8.90 an hour.
No one makes less in this expensive town.
How it is possible to get by in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American teenagers were behind McDonald's desks after school, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Few saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay longer.
Now, I'm constantly interviewing people at McDonald's who complain that they're living off that salary, and sometimes even feeding their kids.
On the other hand, a commentary in the Wall Street Journal forum notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The US law prohibits the management of companies from obstructing this goal by dismissing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, running a business is not easy for them.
The creation of trade unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high turnover.
Dissatisfied
Noisy protests were also held outside many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan that day.
The climax of the protests was a noon rally outside McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should all support fast food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the scene, far from all of whom are employed in the fast-food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain is only moderately deceivable so far"
The subject of augmented reality, which is popular with modern technologists, has recently been seen through the lens of special glasses.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, speaking to Shahram Izadi, head of the Interactive 3D Technology Group at Microsoft Labs in Cambridge, it is clear that the glasses were just a transit station for the company's scientists.
It is exciting to be able to manipulate virtual objects in the air with your bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly the research your group is conducting.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
But we want to look forward to five to ten years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What's the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much of it still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output has not been decisive.
We're trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to unlock the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
This requires not only the user but also the environment.
We could then more easily supplement the real world with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this stupid virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its own particular niche.
For example, we worked on a project in the area of controlling objects in public places, where we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of overloading.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future is mixed control, such as gestures and language.
- What do you mean?
- We'd ask you to hand me this can of spray?
You're saying it and you're implying it.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- You mean you want the user to adjust to what a machine can do at a given time and what it can't?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that allow us to record people's reactions more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, because they provide good resolution at depth, which is very important.
What are your claims based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it lacking in resolution, depth, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the important thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
The resolution along the X and Y axes must be taken into account, as must the resolution along the Z axis.
The speed and number of frames per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond lab with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
For my work, I needed a device just like this, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It's not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, because more calculations would be necessary.
What would be great is a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera angles to see how that helps us in three-dimensional positioning.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life, the best prospects are in glasses?
- Of course, it's not comfortable to always hold a smartphone in your hands while you're on the road, but I think this is the best option: an augmented reality "switch" where we can switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud.
The glasses are a personal gadget and that is their strength (private ones can only be seen by you), but also their weakness, because augmented reality using glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but to normal mortals as well.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
My hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about augmented reality as the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could very well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection medium.
She's a great pressure sensor!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something hand-held, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is, produces a feeling, but at the moment it is still as faint as someone blowing over the palms of the hands.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make it think it feels what it should feel when it's looking at something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge we will have to contend with for a long time: to make a person believe that he is physically in a closed space, but instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain has been only moderately devious, and we have many years of hard work ahead of us.
And that's what makes working in virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: we're just getting started on a lot of things.
The taste of the people rather than the culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", which is dedicated to the city's inhabitants who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
The selected list already includes high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city limits and who often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded red-robed man, who you meet at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene meetings, at the opening ceremonies.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous figure of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street he brings a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens and ensures their good mood.
He recently grabbed a drummer and became a drummer in St. Petersburg, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist life, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with looks and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm elicits aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Every provocation I've had in the past has been an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Palace of Culture where my work was exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free painters, but not officially recognized at that time, came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of "Gazonewschina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
I'm drawn to the theater, fashion, music, everything except literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, where, until the renovation work, there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the House of the St. Petersburg Bohemians.
A lot of them were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember Schnur coming there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and included the now-famous composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his big career, but he learned the basics from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the Art Clinic.
That's where our staff and regulars went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture was still important.
In 2000, the press carried out a survey on the "personalities of our city" award.
I won the "Artist of the Year" category, and that was my peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls, and they clearly express the timeliness and sharpness of the thought.
I'm having an exhibition on the subject of "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be.
In a clown, it blurs all that and loses its tragicness.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let's save the world by making it mandatory for everyone to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and focuses on the outward appearance of the person, not the inner person.
But maybe you shouldn't shake hands with a man, you should spit in his face.
The illusion disappears through disguise.
We saw you recently playing the role of the city's drummer.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one thing and the common people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill that everybody likes.
Now you have to figure out who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But thousands of people come to Stas Mikhailov's performances!
- Abandoned women come to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people are coming instead of 10,000, so there is less management, less money, and everything is going to collapse.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy the achievement.
When I was young, I painted such pictures that a collector even had them hanging in a series of Falk and Larionov's works.
I started with images that don't usually come until the end of a career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It's called intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something else entirely.
I'm a man of the past, and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That's the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what is missing from Petersburg?
- They're good cultural experts.
They say, "Servants of culture".
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Tsars were different, because the Tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that they needed real experts.
There are good advisers in Moscow at the moment.
In St. Petersburg, we have some who could be experts, but they are blocked because we need higher-level experts to properly evaluate the first and clear the way for them.
Now it's all about your taste.
The same goes for Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they don't accept all contemporary art and some painters have to find other museums.
- What is Petersburg to you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can hardly grow on our rocks.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
We have a lot less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft carrying Earthlings are on the lookout for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the big question is, how can we reproduce in weightlessness or on the alternate planet?
I don't think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus", says scientist Vladimir Surdin of the Sternberg Institute for Astronomy.
However, while conditions on Mars are relatively livable, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers in terms of the flora.
Experiments with plants had been conducted half a century earlier.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit was not in the least different from the terrestrial species.
Then came the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchdogs were sent into space to investigate how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It's developing into a normal chick.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chick needs to find a place to stand; it needs to be able to stand on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the RAN Institute for Medical-Biological Problems.
Without solid ground, the chicks were wildly overwhelmed.
Ten hours later, the newborns' instincts were completely numb.
The chicks didn't respond to light or sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we hatched chicks and then stopped the whole thing because it's just impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev of the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last animal-cage was launched into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only be home to species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and research must continue", notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals, humans could do this in principle.
Homo sapiens are capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkov.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the question: Will it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth after this flight?
"In the end, no one answered that question", says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkov, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who had been in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
But there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who, after long flights, have been successful and have produced healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even in orbit", concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet mankind must find new ways to use biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravity.
The Hydrolab at the Cosmonaut Training Center is a mandatory stop during flight preparation.
Here, in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
While adults may find water pleasant, it is a foreign environment; infants, however, find it a natural element.
It's as if the little ichthyanders are testifying that life on land arose from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that a baby is in the amniotic fluid for about nine months in the mother's womb and the fact that it is easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming is only two weeks.
"That's not enough time to forget", says swimming instructor Marina Aksenowa.
So while weightlessness is a much more natural state for a newborn, the woman does not do without gravity.
In the weightless state, the abdominal and pelvic muscles recede tremendously quickly, and with that, the ability to squeeze the child out also decreases.
All right, let's get this thing bypass the birth control.
For example, the birth could take place in a special chamber to squeeze the baby out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravitational pull of the earth, the body cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a training suit in orbit like an adult.
He'll just miss the things that are essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we are conducting together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled, completely unadapted human being", predicts Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the RAN Institute for Medical-Biological Problems.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory.
But eventually it will become a reality when the inhabitants of Earth set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that will become home to their spaceman-born offspring.
NKÚ chief: Control of the black system fails because of politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate legislation on public procurement, but falls short in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Control Authority (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, said that the government is not in a position to control the situation.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I don't think that's the case here", Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to have been obtained by a joint check by Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative example of practice, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas towards the so-called "black system".
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the prime minister cannot just come and obstruct the control authority, whose duty is to control compliance with the law", Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Committee on Audit of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke of a joint Czech-German project to compare the laws of the two countries on public procurement.
What was the point?
This is a parallel test which we started about two years ago.
In short, it is the European legislation that determines how public procurement is to be handled, and national legislation builds on this, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all these with each other and although the examination is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep drawing up new and more precise rules, but that we must also look at the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What do you think about the results of this project?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and to lower and lower thresholds when it does not seem to be having a particularly positive effect.
Economy means buying something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering the thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be that we are only overloading the system with paperwork in this way, and those who are looking for loopholes in the system will find it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds were kept higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college, which is only slightly different in form, but in principle both authorities work similarly.
The powers are also to some extent comparable, but Germany is a federal state, which means that there are these accounting offices in the individual federal states - this is where the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which is equivalent to our state funds.
The public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the Land Accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to compare this without specific information, but Germany is often called a model in some respects, although it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the examiners are better there?
I'm not sure, but as I said, I don't like comparisons like that.
It should be noted that those countries which are a model for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our agency, would they?
As regards the Czech legislation, what significance has the amendment of the Public Procurement Law had for your authority? Do you feel any impact?
Given that this amendment has been in force for only a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our examinations.
Since our checks are carried out at a later date, we must expect a delay.
The impact of the changes will be felt more in the preparatory phase of future checks - we have introduced the new control instrument 'Detection of uneconomic risks' and have used it to examine and analyse almost 14 000 public contracts - where the changes will naturally have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the passage of this law as a positive thing, or will the system be burdened with more bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be observed.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of the regional policy, the Regional Council) in that any non-compliance with the procurement law amounts to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think that's the way it is.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have made a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let us first say which path is not conducive.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneurs with so-called "black system" controls - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid to the Member States, but it has already decided to grant it to the Member States.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it", but he can't say that we're pretending like nothing happened.
The law on public procurement contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the best bidder is excluded solely on the grounds of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
The roads are occasionally icy, but mostly dry.
The roads of the Czech Republic are partly snow and ice.
However, the roads are mostly well-maintained and sometimes require extra caution.
The Commission
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were well-traveled this morning, occasionally snow and ice.
Temperatures have fallen to -5 to -10 degrees Celsius, and it's expected to be a little warmer during the day.
The region is now without snow, and only a thin blanket of snow remains in the lower elevations.
However, the crests of the Ore Mountains are covered with about 12 inches [30 cm] of snow.
According to the district road patrol, visibility was limited due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the roadways are sometimes icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also open.
However, sections of these roads are still frozen or snow-covered.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
The road safety authorities in the Czech Republic have also been informed that the road safety measures are being taken to ensure that the road is not blocked by snow.
The road authorities warn drivers of the risk of ice, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
The ice sheet can occur in particular on second and third class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly present on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Hory Mountains.
A thick layer of snow lies at high altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, the weather is mostly sunny or clear, and it remains largely rain-free.
Temperatures range from minus 3 to minus 1 degrees Celsius, and there's a slight wind.
District of Pilsen
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now well-maintained, but local attention is required and the driving style is adapted to the weather.
This one is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures have fallen since, the roads may be icy.
Local fog is also expected, but visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information is from the county road championships.
The D5 motorway is almost completely accessible, but the road authorities recommend greater attention between the 80th and 131st kilometres.
The first-class roadways are mostly dry but frozen.
However, in the southern parts of the Pilsen and Tachov districts, there may be a partial glacial shift.
The second and third class roadways are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections is also applicable.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
District of Olomouc
Drivers heading for the high altitudes of the Olomouc district must expect snow today.
After the use of scatter vehicles, snow remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nighttime snowfall forced the road masters to use the snow, in Šumperk county fell about 3 cm of fresh snow, according to the road administration.
In the rest of the district, the roads are usually free.
"In Šumperk county, there are still snow remnants in the highlands.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers heading towards Jeseník must expect snow", an employee of the Šumperk Road Administration told the ČTK news agency today.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to her, the roads to the highlands are clean and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc the roads are fully navigable, but in Šternberk drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roadways are still wet.
District of Ústí nad Labem, District of Liberec
In North Bohemia, the road authorities report several road sections which are not suitable for road use.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below freezing even in lower latitudes, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads.
No traffic disruption has been reported so far.
Ice sheet is reported in particular from the Štětí area.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for this were at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless skies and frost at night.
The main routes and the road I/13 on the border between Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported to have poor traffic conditions.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be closed because of branches that were pushed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans are so eager to jump on.
We're more of a joke about this with our band, The Tap Tap, and we say that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also be performing a unique project, with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It's a nationwide benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
To do this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is predicted to end on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The concerts are supposed to end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in a time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally by me, we then worked on the idea with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We want to not only gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about the state of the world we are going to leave to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key chains against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing via www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap also recorded the so-called "Doomsday Anthem" with other artists.
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and that's all the way to the end, assuming everything works out and the end of the world doesn't happen...
The hymn is to be sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
The lyrics of the anthem are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We try to involve these people in our projects.
And it turns out that most of them are interested in working with us, and they enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world serve?
For the establishment of the accessible educational centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute.
Students at the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
The Jedlička Institute will be completed with a separate building, which we will move into with this project.
Each concert features several groups and performers.
What criteria did you use to select these?
We wanted to put together a program that appealed to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, there are Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
More information is available on the Internet at www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
We would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York next year, and I personally would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago, if we are already in the United States.
Your plans abroad are not small, you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
But the Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, so the wheelchairs have to be carried in the trunk, and of course we have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered in part.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Your trips abroad will give you a comparison of how accessibility is in different countries, how people with disabilities are treated there, etc.
How have you experienced these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than here, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Compared with Prague, Moscow is not at all handicapped. There it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to be alone in the city center.
It is not even a matter of course to leave a wheelchair user in an elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also groups that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways must we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things we are still hanging on to...
It should be noted, however, that the improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move around in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
It is not uncommon for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events, and we are a bit ahead of the West in this with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but only when we have great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers in our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a tutor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone among other things, I started a music company with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say, things got a little out of hand. (Laughter)
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We've come to realize that when you do something and you can't see it from the outside, your performance doesn't exist in a sense.
The EU funding also enables us to afford good editors, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In show business, one person often copies another.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and is not accepted until after a long time.
There are very few things that are truly unique, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned creatures that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live and develop fully, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, it's not just a breakthrough for them, it's a breakthrough for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful to this success that you are a strict boss, as many people have heard?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise in many things and you must also demand a certain discipline.
I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have to rehearse twice a week, go through preparation stages, and spend a lot of time on tour, then the enthusiasm fades quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in any band that's serious about working and trying to get something done.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
There's only one:
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected by live broadcast and a joint interpretation of the anthem "The End of the World Is Coming" by The Tap Tap will be played.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the construction of a multifunctional centre for disabled people, to be called STUDEO, at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
Tickets are available at the Bohemiaticket pre-sale.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, making it the second member from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which joined ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's journey into space began much earlier, of course.
Even before World War II, Polish space enthusiasts were interested in space travel, but they did not always understand it.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934 for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognition for his contributions to space exploration was recognized, among other things, by naming one of the craters on the far side of the Moon after him.
As early as 1925, a railway dray was built in Poland, with a rocket propulsion system planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to slow down the Draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled shells.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents submitted show that the research had progressed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was interrupted by the German invasion.
In 1937 the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the trade press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects concerned the military use of the rocket propulsion system.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity its work was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company is in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At that time, the first satellite projects were underway, and it was clear that space exploration would have a future.
From its very beginning in 1956, the Polish Aerospace Association (PTA) sought to join the International Federation of Aerospace, which was founded in 1951. In fact, the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile, which had a maximum flight altitude of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the Błędów Desert with the RM-2 two-stage rocket.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kilograms.
A further stage of development should already be capable of carrying out real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing high winds.
However, in 1962 further development was stopped.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this missile were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), differing in the size of the space for transporting scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missile had a carrying capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude of all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Later versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later by the creation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites under the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the law on public works.
This decision aroused a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unrestrained financial speculation.
The large differences in the value of labour (wages) give rise to price tensions.
This is a situation in which the producer tries to compete economically by importing low-priced goods, by 'under-selling' the competition in order to gain a larger share of the market and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means that most companies are either moving their production abroad, buying cheaply there, or going out of business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure must necessarily increase.
This situation is further aggravated by the absolute reluctance of the entrepreneurs to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are handing over their own people to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes to existing legislation.
The aim of these measures is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the wage sector.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the case of longterm unemployment, and, on the other, by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, and the gap between rich and poor is widening.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery agencies for the poor who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own labour for some years now.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the State has to increase their income to the subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU southern states will undoubtedly result in the same situation where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social status (as was the case in the 19th century) or to work for a starvation wage on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
The question naturally arises here: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, it merely migrates poverty from one country to another; or capital is left out altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all, the workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This is the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media insist to the extreme that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is narrowly inclined to the view that the state cannot intervene in the economy in a direct way.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a lobby that is practically omnipotent and ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual preference, legislation where practically everything is criminal but nothing is.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry, lacking funds, has charged private legal firms closely linked to industry with drafting legislation.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
All power will then no longer come from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from powerful financial groups who put their own interests ahead of their own.
Clearly, liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation described by Appian in his Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: "The State had long been in decay, and the offices were taken by force.
By bribery, by illegal advantage, or by stone and sword.
Corruption grew unchecked, and the people went to the polls with votes already bought"... "People of character did not run for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline"... "It was already really beginning to be said that the only medicine in this difficult situation was monarchy, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with monarchy.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the benefits to society as a whole.
The result, then as now, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who make no effort at all to carry out deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be found in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community, but it has decided to make a proposal for a regulation on the future of the Community.
It is particularly catastrophic that the elites of today are completely ignorant of the potential future loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and modern history.
The abolition of the law on charitable work is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
The pressure of global and European economic competition will force the Czech Republic to continue to seek ways of pushing down the social level of its population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is to implement targeted political and social reforms which increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel is a laboratory of chaos.
"that nothing comes from violence, or could ever come from violence", sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is: "so that we don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no war", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there have been, as always, a number of reactions.
One side is for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other side is supporting the Palestinians, arguing that the Israeli state is racist, that it is genocidal against the Palestinian Arabs, and calling the Israeli state terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who is responsible for and who is the victim of these repeated waves of killing; after all, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence itself.
My aim is to give readers a glimpse behind the scenes, a glimpse of who the 95 years of tension (starting with the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in that tiny patch of Middle Eastern country are most serving.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, partly derived from these and partly derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people are having a major influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In any era, we can make out an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their own steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We have to recognize that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it did not arise within the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families, one particularly outstanding, which one might call the head of the Kraken (I don't know if anyone else is above them, but I don't rule that out) is the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about her.
I can understand that.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1890s to prevent their name from being associated with high-level criminal activity, which was always about strengthening their power, increasing their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and they wage wars or arm themselves against countries where they are not involved in central banks (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi there were only four, with Russia in the meantime subordinating its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to stand up to this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschilds' status as the central bank, began issuing his own (i.e. state) notes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for causing the 1929 Great Depression.
The Rothschilds' global power lust led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars between 1859 and 1871 by Albert Pik, a 33rd and thus highest degree of enlightenment.
The first war was to destroy the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war is to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and luxuries and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the forerunner here), and finally lead to the seizure of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top work is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED, so that crises like the ones they triggered in 1907 do not recur).
After succeeding in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire by means of the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsarist Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to start the Second World War more easily, the bankers had politics create a latent conflict situation by burdening Germany with gigantic war reparations; they thus created the prerequisite for impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans on with a sufficiently strong leader who named the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column and also took on fire to start the war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (Return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, mentioned earlier, set the stage for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, leading to initial clashes with the Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain by which the international bankers had initially kept him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, but in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel is the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the victims on the front lines, as they were in the Second World War, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country itself but also internationally (just think how sharply people divide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
We must distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders, because the international bankers in Israel, as well as in our country, the people, are voting exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-prone politician loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything in his power to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict and could lead to the destruction of the world economy because of Iran's control of the two-mile-wide Strait of Hormuz, which supplies 20% of the world's oil.
In what light are David Rockefeller's words of 1994: "All we need is a global crisis, and people will welcome the new world order?"
They imagine the new world order as a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to bring this creature under total control.
"And it makes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one may buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: When the worst is over, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
The American government had no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the ensuing failure of the violent attempt to free the hostages only made matters worse.
The diplomats who were captured were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages has triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The Iran debacle was a major contributor to the defeat of Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get the refugees out of Iran, using an extravagant story to conceal their true identities - they were traveling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew who were supposedly visiting the country to film a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by "Exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret, but the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time it is also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husari play such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood of the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the filming of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically and slightly over-the-top come from here.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits at the conference table, in the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable career comeback with this film.
From a mocked actor he has become a respected director, and as an actor he is no longer the object of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not to be set in the director's hometown of Boston.
The sense of place was one of the features that set this director's previous films apart from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really happened - the opening sequence of the assault of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity, yet it conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team are also doing a similar thing with fictional scenes (the fake film stick in a Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn't actually offer many cinematically exciting scenes.
But he works with the few quite successfully, sometimes helping reality - which doesn't always seem so elegant (the scenes where the impending crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America, or the pursuit on the runway, seem somewhat fabricated).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and that makes them far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses some traction, and it's a film that you can watch with a certain amount of interest, and yet enjoy the design and the retro style that reminds you of a thriller from the '70s.
But it is hard to get excited about it.
But it is enough to remind us of a piece of history that is still alive in a way and to prove how exaggerated the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are.
Guidelines for balloon inflation, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually puts out a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided to hold the contest "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop" this year.
"We came up with this idea after the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% female share in the management of large European companies", said Patrik Nacher, who organised the survey, to the newspaper Právo.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of workers' rights in the event of a breach of the rules on the protection of workers' rights.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they were objectively less risky to the insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is harmful to the environment, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, and the chicken cage size directive, which has made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, the de facto prohibition of the use of the term 'butter-based ink' and the prohibition on the sale of conventional light bulbs have also been criticized.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of one or another lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member states (the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even by veto).
Lobbying interests also advocated that bananas of the highest commercial grade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not have a 'curvature anomaly'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it merely harmonised the disparate national standards which would impede trade.
The EU has already softened the standards for fruit and vegetables, despite the opposition of some countries, with the indication that the existing directives would lead to food waste.
One candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation from last year, which requires balloons to be sold with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU cited an American study which found that balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation among children.
A similar restriction already applies to children under 14 years of age when using annual crops.
Curious ideas are also at home
A directive which concerns European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone holding an official position in the EU is not allowed to use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated the EU regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a member state, in addition to the other absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, then exceeded the prescribed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a heavy fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of giving grants to applications for grants.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we do not have an ocean.
We will apply to the EU for a refund", declared Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), then Minister of Agriculture, in autumn 2004.
The argument was that the cereal harvests were very high and that the State stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally went so far as to organise a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries with no access to the sea.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to provide the Commission with the necessary information to enable it to carry out its tasks.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole are, in the opinion of some experts, more deserving of recognition.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment, which is to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
The Czech Republic, like other Member States, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for traditional products and does not always win this battle.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky' after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, our producers had to rename the domestic rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, 'Tuzemák'.
The term 'rum' may be used only for products made from sugarcane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU now includes, together with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the Lübeck marzipan and the Parma cheese, the Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, and the Saar hops.
The EU mark is a good example of the Pardubice cheesecake or the Hořic rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur", Okamura claims.
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
I'm not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can't stand to see the Republic being looted for 20 years, thieves running around free, while people are being raised in taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and nonpartisan, I have no other way to make a difference than to run for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, and then you headed straight for the castle.
You're not turning your back on your constituents?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm gonna take up the fight for the castle after the results of the Senate elections.
I later clarified this and said that I would run for the office of President if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not function, it's a tool that I can use to realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty is not only that we as a people curse in the pub and on TV, but that we crush anyone who wants to change.
In addition, the media, which seeks to rob you of your honor, confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was alleged to have bribed journalists or to have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive declarations of assets of 20 million crowns.
You'll have to change the law.
As President, you have no authority in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have advocated that the tour guide should remain a free trade, and this has been achieved.
The problem is small-minded politics - when someone from the right or the left comes up with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only holds the population back.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what's best for our country from either party without any paperwork or party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person who is more right-wing or left-wing in politics?
From a Czech point of view, I think people see me more on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move on.
I don't care if someone is on the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I have always publicly supported any good solution, whether it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like being called a populist.
But don't you confirm that with what you just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's the one you want to approach.
I think you can call this populism, but all the proposals I've talked about are already working in the world, or they've been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you're left with slogans.
And that's not going to get you anywhere in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you'll be able to enforce, for example, material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push through these goals.
As President, I would have no problem in calling on the leaders of the parliamentary parties to establish by law the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then the respondents might have to say why they are against it.
A strong personality who points out wrongs can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself, and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura saving the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know that I can't do anything alone, so I've talked to several well-known people about whether they want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken to Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of the workload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the light fuel oil trade.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people were deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of those eligible to vote have not voted at all, and those who have voted have mostly voted for establishment representatives.
That leaves us two independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen such a composition of the Senate that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
But I'm going to fight for my vision, like direct election of mayors and district mayors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; there are only 20,000 CZK in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset declarations. What did yours look like?
I estimate my personal wealth at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few more millions on my account.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream, by the way. I always liked James Bond, the way he drove the car, the way he was gallant with women and the way he fought evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, you're worth 60 million, and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't get much interest.
And I'm not obligated to fund the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign costs are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; nor could I finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So you're going to stay as an entrepreneur to make ends meet?
Didn't you say you were going to withdraw these activities?
But it's not about the amount of the salary.
As promised, I've partially reversed my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan saving the Republic.
But I have to make a living.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and it's still going on.
But as president, I would stop my business altogether.

The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - with the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and there's something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large local company, says, "Yeah, it's nice, the house".
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
They all have the Internet, iPads and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to one of those old-style libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy little town just outside Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The municipality of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counter this stupidity, a few years ago it was decided to help raise awareness and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the educational campaign was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become a master of statistics: a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, a master of the bold beam diagrams and producer of funny, even often cynical buildings, took the matter with his usual calmness and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around in stupor and shrugging its shoulders, the cowardly Maas piled his exquisite contributions of greatness into a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear city council!"
That is my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called Book Mountain!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is uncovered.
It is part of a revitalization project which also includes a garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small towns, which until then had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
First impression: a book-eldorado with a cheese bell.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain range, the real joy of space and reading comes from walking up the topography.
The interior is bright and clear, the burnt brick floors and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
They're already looking for park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere there were books, books, books.
"The bookshelves are usually along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We've reversed the traditional room configuration and turned the reading area inside out.
The interior of the book mound is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center, and a home technology center.
A special delight are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes trim, sometimes stair rails.
Optics, touch and smell are foreign.
Even seasoned architects and civil engineers are shaking their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the Standard.
And so one day, in a farm in Friesland, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic film has been used as a root cover in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin fabric lasts for two seasons, then it's ready for the garbage bin.
For the library, the fleece was pressed to four-centimeter-thick plates - the first time in this quantity.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called land-based plastic (KLP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a sports shoe.
After 105 steps, you reach the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter trek, the literature café not only offers a fantastic view of the city but also Dutch croquettes and stuffed fig trees.
They provide atmosphere, but most importantly, the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"It's hard to believe, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is an ecological landmark", says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass cascade, the sun shines only briefly in on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue bands that cross the glass facade serve as shade and capture much of the sun's radiation.
The room's climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic in the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And so does the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg a "long overdue soul" of spice.
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
The aim is to fill the gaps in the library, which is not yet fully equipped and currently has 70,000 items.
The concept has taken off.
The shelves are full to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-sized library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for show.
This has enabled the MVRDV to achieve what is known in the technical jargon as the "founding of identity".
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
Young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin balances this on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin was in.
Why? Why?
Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Germany must be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
That is because it is currently changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
The European Union has a number of important tasks to fulfil.
So the Germans are in between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still in their early stages of their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean in practice from the German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
So we have to be careful not to embarrass the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
That certainly matters.
But I would not want to give too much weight to it either, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
I do not think that this was a break as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for itself.
It is a sign that it is being taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the Obama administration is probably quite understanding of the European position behind the scenes.
But given the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not that enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a larger line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans understand that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player in this role - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or is it still difficult for Germany to lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, a variety of anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's the old problem, you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to a wide range of neighbours and opinions, and that's not easy.
The US is steadily losing its influence in European politics, but the EU is not filling that vacuum at the moment. Who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable for them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a name which is officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the originating companies.
However, it is protected as long as the actual namesake does not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the firm Taylor Wessing, which specializes in infringements in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The copycat is only required to register a few additional letters.
So Gucci is just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with the registration of the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artistic name also used by the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeit goods.
But Pattloch's case is different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposing the official granting of the right to use a name already protected elsewhere by the Chinese company.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
That's women who go fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is damaging to business, and we have to fight it", Pattloch says.
"The brand is being watered down, the exclusive is disappearing, the image damage is enormous".
The financial losses and the legal costs of the industries concerned are in the millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the deletion of dubious entries in the trade mark register is difficult to achieve and costs money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected actions because after a long period of time the name in question had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he would even have to pay the plagiarist money for violating their trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired the German concrete pump manufacturer Plastmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, and Geely had to change it.
Fashion company Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The Commission notes that the Chinese authorities have not provided any evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim that the Chinese authorities have not provided sufficient evidence to support the claim.
Last year, however, the "working environment returned to normalcy" from the emergency situation.
The number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 objections pending before the Office.
It is a costly task to combat
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations in the world for the tenth consecutive time, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trade marks, which totals 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simply put, each application costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
The cost of tackling this is manyfold, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts out of the way.
However, the copycat continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This was not done, because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO rejected the objection of the Munich residents.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight to this day.
You gotta be careful
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will end well and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely time-consuming and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves".
The internal costs were hard to quantify, and the company's archives had to go through files that were over a hundred years old to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle the dispute, but to no avail.
"It shows how much we value it", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, when imitators secure unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business line has long since been abandoned by the group, but it has been able to avoid registration.
"You have to be hell-bent", says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather, as Wentzler says, foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worthy of protection in China".
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registering.
In fact, if Freudenberg were to lose in the final act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the other license fees for one's own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Youth Day: Stomping, singing and helping
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that spans more than 8,733 kilometers.
First there's the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, finding it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly swell, compelling and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes as he combines them with his smoothly wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
The 50 singers are aged between 23 and 69, ranging from the human geneticist to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each chorus has a different text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
Worldwide, some 34 million people are infected with HIV, estimates the United Nations AIDS Program.
23,5 million of these live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans of AIDS in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa found sponsors in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak the Bantu language fluently but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign, soft language, and occasionally returning them to where they originated: southern Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers [8,733 mi] from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the strength of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some in simple mud and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them have no parents because they have died of HIV.
In Esitjeni, we see what the whole of Swaziland is suffering from: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
Male foreskin circumcisions, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the general population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune deficiency virus, and dying by mid-30's is not uncommon.
On a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but most importantly, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and provide him with a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the organization "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Fleas and ticks are parasitic STIs.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and Drypoids are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all reported cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), trippers and human papillomaviruses are common.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - yet, about 20 percent of new HIV infections are among this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common among adolescents.
How have the infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsory.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary discomfort, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100 percent protection.
In some cases, STDs can also be transmitted through lubricant infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially for those who frequently change sexual partners.
Early detection can cure most STIs and prevent later consequences.
Sponsorships, donations and, not least, the prizes the choir earns throughout Germany, bring a lot together.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairwoman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and determined woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well-housed, like at one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads and making sure that the children in their uniforms arrive at school every day on time.
Those who have no one left come to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Voices for Africa also started a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and worked with the U.S. health organization PSI to get many people in the village tested for HIV.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is best left quietly dead.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is a complete taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Actually, it's strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
It is also due to this government-sanctioned way of life that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are available on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh".
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels to southern Africa every two or three years, singing songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy but has also brought a few tears to the eyes of some fierce border guards.
The journey always leads to Estjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although the small village is hard to find on maps, it is more than well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esteni, there is light", the people there say.
And if you go back to the 8,733-kilometer airline to Heidelberg, to the singers stomping in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see it lit up there too.
NASA has detected ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is said to be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence of an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
It is said to be at least 12 inches [30 cm] thick and possibly as much as 65 feet [20 m] thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
But no one has linked the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said chief scientist Sean Solomon of the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and tiny robots like the Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, tiny peepholes into infinite distances.
This image is from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition.
This image from the infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are seen as blue dots, the more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the galaxy.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This dazzling glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is made of material the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the birthplace of the galaxy.
The Pleiades constellation, also known as "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
But the telescope makes the colors more visible.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula in this infrared photo looks toward the viewer.
It's located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this mist the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photography creates the spectacular color rendering.
This baby star was not seen in its full beauty until the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came to be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.

One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-divided, three-column), because dark streaks of dust divide the blazing heart of the star's birthplace into three.
In the constellation of Serpens, astronomers have photographed the harbors of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are racing toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't know any technical abbreviations, you might as well call it the Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Cradle of Stars is always producing new youngsters.
This cloud of stars, combined with the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly producing new baby stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was predominantly hydrogen.
Our Insights into Space - The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - before Galileo Galilei used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become larger and larger - and the insights they provide have become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to look out into space through two mirrors, each one 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save money.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 35 feet [11 m].
The disadvantage of the convenient design is that the telescope is fixed at an angle of height - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at altitude.
Its special feature is its high light-collecting power.
This is because, despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it is comparable to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening in on the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), anyone with a computer can help by providing computing power.
The European Observatory (ESO) is located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters thick - and made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
But pictures are expected in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each averaging ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks up at the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is to be built on Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
Here is an illustration of it.
But the most important images from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it has been supplying images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that it had identified 1235 planet candidates since the mission began.
This image documents the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket in early 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that ice exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the Messenger orbits much closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements have suggested for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Launched in 2004, the Messenger probe - the first to orbit Mercury - has now given scientists certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and living to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbled along the winding road, past dense forested hills, raging rivers, and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, of whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Assyrian perfectly and are very long-lived.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town is full of over-simplified Soviet-era architecture that doesn't fit in with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
The 200 miles (323 km) take eight hours because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the documented life of about eight dozen Talys from the area, which is older than 100 years. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he lived to be 120.
At 136 years old, she still has a child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given the record of the oldest man, who lived to be 122 years old, Mussulmov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So Şirali Müslümov, at his age, has been counting on a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an ageing researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also strikingly many elderly people in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and in Sardinia there are also extremely many very old men".
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age could be kept, in particular because of the absence of a register of persons.
Every day, glass melted butter
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 persons over the age of 100.
So why are there so many elderly people in the South?
Farid Mugimzadeh, an Assyrian guide, explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it's the diet.
But the idea that the high-calorie diet of the Talish people, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem very plausible from a nutritional standpoint.
In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two little kids are jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in the typical armadu cups.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her headcloth she hides long, dark-blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it never went out and kept its color.
"I've never used shampoo myself", Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in the supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was in the period after the Second World War.
But things got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult of the father of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, an amount that is good for living in local conditions.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-haired son is right: "The elderly are held in high esteem in our culture".
They live in the midst of the extended family, being loved, cared for, and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as its basis is hotly debated.
The Egyptian president has not spared on pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the people as a whole, but perhaps especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a god-state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, as Mohammed Morsi said almost apologetically, temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California in the United States, really wants to save, is what the Egyptians are worried about, and the world is not quite clear about.
Should the judiciary be stripped of its powers?
Indeed, the 234 articles that were whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a 15-hour nightly parforcery are somewhat worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft law states that the judiciary is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what is "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal space that comes with it to interpret the Sharia more strictly.
This is at least suggested by a newly added article: in all matters concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University should be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great influence in all Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislature, which would de facto result in the disempowerment of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation
The problem is that the civilian military judiciary should continue to exist.
These courts were used during Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The draft also calls on the state to "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and to promote its morals and values".
This is so vague in legal terms that governmental institutions could even use this article to control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, that means nothing but censorship.
The Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of sexual exploitation.
Another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording of the directive is also dubious, suggesting that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar enough?
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the Islamist supremacy.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual unity on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to overthrow the charter before it could even come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place winner in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution was "on the dustbin of history".
He accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to stage a "coup against democracy" via the short-news service Twitter.
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for", Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced they would not oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Quran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, counter-demonstrated, but not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many women and Salafists in veils took part in the demonstration, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded of Morsi: "Clean the land!" and asserted: "The Koran is our constitution".
A battle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have probably created civil war-like conditions.
Morsi's supporters obviously did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood explained that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights doesn't even come up"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their worldview, but because he believes that human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution", he complained in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state led to the lawyer's resignation.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto abolishing it", complains Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels alone, even by the international community, which views the ideological directional struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could be revenge.
A protester on Tahrir warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control".
Norway's shark: Is it the world's most disgusting fish?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the country's success be related to the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
This is about the amount of smell that you can imagine from the nasal mucus of rackfish, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, spectacular scenery, and that persistent smell in the air that just won't go away.
Rackfish is salt-laced trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how stinky you want your fish to be.
When darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, really very lucrative specialty.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire department but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-General".
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"People like the aquavit more than the shellfish", says Havard.
The alcohol can displace the smell.
I'll have a bite.
Avoiding putting the shellfish near the nose is not bad - like sushi, which has a rather long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish were soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in the autumn.
In the depths of winter, it was then taken out after a long fermentation and consumed - no doubt under the influence of alcohol.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even Sweden, the old rival, which was far richer than Norway not too long ago, is flooding in.
Rakfisk is considered important - an essential, though strongly scented, part of Norwegian history.
It's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here, people still hate to mention Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, they refer only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main contributor to Norway's current wealth has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, who is handing out round tablets of ripe shellfish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are a prudent people, as they say.
Your English is just as flawless as most people here.
We're not very pretentious, we don't like bragging.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global economic crisis, when everyone was throwing money around that they didn't have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And, of course, eating shellfish", she adds with a lighthearted laugh.
I'm standing in the snow, waiting for another dish - I've had enough of rackfish.
I'm not sure what an elk burger is, but the juicy meat is good for me.
But by evening, the stink fish is back on the menu.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that host a shellfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There's a live TV feed of a showmaster dressed in flies surrounded by plates of shellfish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What's your score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Harvard".
You clap and you laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh smells of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
As Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
Even on better days, it is a city that is always clogged, but on Monday a ring of steel was erected that blocks several important transport routes into the capital and creates chaos on the streets.
The aim was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential oath and assume the leadership of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Mexico has been doing well economically under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My administration is strongly committed to reducing violence", Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy to help us achieve that goal.
Before he was on par with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A straight man
For example, in the remote town of Valle del Bravo, people remember him fondly.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can take one of the highways that Pena Nieto built, a major improvement over the bumpy, bumpy roads that once existed.
His name is also displayed outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change which our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the opposition's accusations that the new president lacked substance.
He's a very direct man, very committed, and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be greater than the paved streets of Valle del Bravo.
Hidden beneath highway crossings, the place is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisively urban nature.
The military was called in earlier this year to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a patch of marshland near a large dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
Pena Nietos' critics believe that he did not address the problem of women's murder adequately during his tenure.
But at worst, his government has turned a blind eye to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the slum, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed", recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the rigidity of the corpse had already been applied.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, next to a cross bearing one word: justice.
But that is what the family has been denied until now.
The authorities treated me as if I were a gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want you to just accept their judgment and shut up.
"But that's not possible with so many mistakes and omissions", she says.
President Pena Nieto's acceptance of the presidential coup d'état on Saturday also means that he is taking on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term.
"I hope he is as president as he was as governor", says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutors say Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse
The prosecution denies Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison.
The hearing will focus on Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges on the grounds of harsh conditions of detention.
The US Army Private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
Prosecutors on Friday sought to determine that Army Private Bradley Manning - accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history - missed several opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered in military prison.
At a cross-examination of Manning during a pretrial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, Major Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month incarceration in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held in response to a motion by the defense to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh prison sentence - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held under enhanced conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When questioned by Fein on Friday about the forms, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints of mistreatment, even though the officers had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns verbally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were looking into them, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) 'no problems,' and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all", Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade his observation status to "injury prevention".
The military said it had granted him this restrictive status - one level below suicide risk - for his own protection and that of others.
"I wanted to convince staff that I was doing well and get rid of the injury prevention watch status (...) in order to achieve what I saw as a higher quality of life", said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at Naval Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and that he had passed out because of the heat.
Not being able to know what was happening to him or to the outside world was stressful.
"My world shrank at Camp Arafjon, at this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning had spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours, often more than 23 hours - and without company.
All he was allowed was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay active because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He had to sleep with light coming in from outside his cell.
If he turned around at night and the guards could not see his face, he was awakened so that he could turn around again.
In January 2011, Manning's attorney formally challenged Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an allegation he made in his testimony on Thursday - that he had slept naked in his cell in Quantico one night and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he never had the opportunity to wrap his blanket around himself during that count.
During Friday's interrogation, Manning said he had inferred from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, and that he had previously tried to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer he could have used the bundle of his underwear or his flip-flops to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experience and drastically reduce his sentence should he be sentenced at his trial at the military court, scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses while other charges deemed too extreme will be challenged.
The prosecution is expected to provide a justification for the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains committed to its position that Manning was held under the same conditions as all other high-security detainees at Quantico.
Manning is charged with facilitating the enemy, illegally posting intelligence on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If found guilty on all counts, he faces life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport checkpoint when a sense of confusion began to spread.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" and another for "Extranjeros".
I stood there for a few seconds, not sure which one to go to.
I grew up in central California and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
An ethnic acronym -- just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided to go with "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for abbreviations or commas.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and stood in line for foreigners.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda was all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc on the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even though he didn't give details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under fire to cede more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be missed.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the country's elites about how the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are on the warpath.
And yet, the biggest challenge for Mexico is actually in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it doesn't.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person -- maybe a parent or a grandparent -- didn't get a chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases, this person matched a profile -- dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living - not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may be obscure at times, but our loyalty is not.
This is clearly the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we're not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
They think our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't be trapped behind the curtain now, with a comfortable life in the United States, but still somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are -- and Mexican Americans take that badly.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they do not belong in either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I was to learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated citizenry want to reestablish their ties with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and pressure the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well, then.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And with the unequal distribution of income, the rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair. I know.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans harbor resentment for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The recent bloody events seem to be stifling such a hope.
Amid the usual blaming, countless buildings were razed to the ground, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza hit near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of that chaos.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there is reason to believe that the deadly stalemate may finally come to an end.
A War That Can Be Neither Won nor Lost
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, the fighting this week has strengthened the hardliners on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, claims to have pushed the Israelis back, even though his group itself suffered heavy casualties.
Despite the deaths of several Hamas leaders and the confinement of the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a rising regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas's cheering supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah is in power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character may face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region for the long term.
Hosni Mubarak, the secularist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood's relationship with Hamas is more muted and its leaders more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas may prove to be an actor that cannot be ousted even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
The United States is firmly on the diplomatic side, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the blockades that have penetrated the West Bank and thus into the main part of a potential Palestinian state, protecting the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law but are continuing to expand.
Netanyahu is in a good position, his Likud party having allied itself with an even more militant group under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on 22 January.
Why should we also coddle these treacherous Palestinians and allow them to have their own state?
If they were in control of the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing missiles like their counterparts in Gaza?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
The hardliners may be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could be a blow to them.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the problems in their own country.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will do little to help the new Arab governments to rebuild their economies.
The fact that the pragmatic President Morsi is joining forces with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long term too.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and as the Arab population grows, this situation will only get worse.
Bloody operations to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take on diplomatic value over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside.
The correct answer is the one advocated by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states, to which Israel cedes territory for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more leverage to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now join Turkey and Qatar in stopping arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arab nations outside the group should also try to bring Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also do his part to get Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems he's just as averse to involvement.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and disease-related body parts on neutral green packaging identical for all tobacco brands
The world's first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have been enacted in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral olive green covers, which also feature dramatic images of diseased body parts and infants and children affected by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, from next Saturday the only difference between the packages is in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small print.
Australia is introducing the strictest regulations on tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government says that studies have shown that people who have not started smoking by the age of 26 are 99% more likely to stop smoking afterwards.
"You can see from young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image", says Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would promote the black market, leading to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious unintended consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be selling far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has skyrocketed since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws in Australia's highest court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stock.
We're good at this.
Experts say the hook in the popularity of social media is the exact population group the plan is targeting.
A series of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from television advertising, banned them from sponsoring sports, and forced most retailers to stop displaying cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"If you sell tobacco and have only a small space left to advertise your products, you can't get around the Internet", says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed a rise in brand reviews written by "really normal people".
The question is: is this just a private individual who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that he even makes a video about them - or is a marketing agency involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws rather than marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries trade with Australia on a large scale.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has been in talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to mandate photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cup and put the box away", says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a picture of a mouth tumor printed on it.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort out a shipment, but now I need four", says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing", he adds, visibly angry.
In a world of constant electricity, it's nice to be bored sometimes
This Thanksgiving, I spent five unexpected hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to get bored with a few thoughts.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty nerve-wracking - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But a growing number of academics and child development experts are pointing to boredom as a positive trait.
If it's up to them, it's okay for us - and our kids - to be bored sometimes.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thought processes, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us nowadays stare at one screen or another almost all the time, we no longer enjoy the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
- I know.
And no, you didn't.
I shall come back to that.
Like many people, I've always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011), does not see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history", he says.
The walls of Pompeii are adorned with a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After reading the research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfying activity but not being able to do it".
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
Apathy, on the other hand, does not impel one to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that while these two conditions might be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, whereas depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the next room that had nothing to do with the content; others heard it at a low volume so that it was barely noticeable; while the third group did not hear the sounds at all.
The people who could hardly hear the television reported feeling more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Attendance disruption can lead to boredom when you try to concentrate on a difficult or exhausting task, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a monotonous activity - "such as searching for defective products on a factory treadmill - music can distract and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that wiggling and crawling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat boredom by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to roam around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a loudspeaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boredom scale" in the 1980's.
On the scale, you'll find statements like, "A lot of things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous", and, "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to become bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But generally speaking, teenagers are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers were bored in school and doing their homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they weren't in school.
Yet, only three percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages of boredom have gone up or down.
He was sure, however, that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have little influence on their daily routines.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and resort to gambling or drugs to alleviate them, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are studying the relationship between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the subject for more than two decades.
"When you're bored, your brain is trying to tell you to do something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's best to do.
When you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you're happy.
But while television can bring happiness in the short term, it can be fleeting in the long run.
So while giving an iPad to a bored child may help to relieve boredom, it does not teach him to entertain himself or to control himself, says Professor Fenske.
He adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to converse but also gains self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We should not be too critical of them either.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even outside of the constant stream of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with you.
"It sounds like we should be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, unrelenting desire to do something meaningful", he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, it is difficult to get busy once the noise is silenced".
Colorado doesn 't have a clear policy on the new marijuana law .
Nineteen-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: possession of a few small marijuana sticks and a pipe he used to smoke them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border one September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - felonies punishable by a $100 fine each - and given a court order.
"We are treated like criminals", says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of marijuana-related violations are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which passed similar measures.
The police authorities will no longer prosecute adults over 21 for possession of small amounts, which will be legally permitted once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative counties of Colorado have announced that they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana offenders and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is moving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads.
They are awaiting guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is considered to be ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and then for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for guidance", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow", he adds.
Washington's law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, and it also marks the end of a grey area where the state's licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And uncomfortable practical questions need to be clarified during this time - such as how to reconcile the state's requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora staff stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses involving individuals over the age of 21 and that police would not pursue criminal charges for these offenses "as of now".
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce city regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a more extreme view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to get users to quit.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute offences that were crimes at the time of the offence", Buck said in a statement.
Reactions are mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer charging adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but he also decided not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
"I don't think I'm going to waste my time enforcing the law until it changes", he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state fueled a deep division among local officials over the big green experiment.
District attorneys are a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana offenders in court and acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for legalization that they still cannot accept it", he believes.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national models for drug legalization.
As advocates and government officials prepare for an era of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Supporters of the legalization movement hope the Justice Department will relent.
Despite several sensational arrests of medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has permitted the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while law enforcement officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to tolerate the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado aren't even waiting for the federal government to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although they may not open for about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, passed a six-month ban, which is expected to be passed next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we're licensing somebody and then we're facing a big problem at the federal level", said City Councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this law change.
We're going to be guided by what the community has decided, not what the state has decided.
There are still many unanswered questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied at Oxford because I'm a Tory
It's not just today's university students who are being attacked for their beliefs.
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended what I once considered the world's greatest temple of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization -- free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of moving to Worscester College in the late 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson mischievously explained that I had dropped out of college because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I was systematically bullied and threatened.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for only one reason - a reason that seemed even more narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My now-deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I bringing this up now?
Now, recent reports suggest that a new generation of moderate-right students are suffering similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now grown to such a degree that a group of them last week called for equal protection for gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared unwelcome".
They are demanding a seat on their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was made worse by a recent BBC Two documentary about political students, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Oxford University Students' Union, driving a Rolls-Royce and sporting a silver suit and silver-plated cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the conservative student union at the University of Nottingham, told a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who initiated the petition for greater protection, said such a climate is "uncomfortable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, the designated president of Oxford's conservative student union, said she had observed a growing rejection of moderate-right students among JCR members.
"This is a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members", she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was one of those minorities.
I arrived in September 1986 as an incredibly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted to withhold an honorary degree from Margaret Thatcher, a former student, because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have scared even Stalinists.
In the first few days of the first semester week, when new students meet each other and the tutors, I get a taste of what's to come.
I found that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even took part in it with pleasure.
Political themes such as the miners' strike, privatization and the government's refusal to sanction South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wooden board rooms of the tutorial.
The first of these events, I was supposed to translate 18th-century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (who has since died), "please translate the first paragraph".
I tripped.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty nasty.
"Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
Tears are pouring in my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few French lessons in your spare time - that is, if you are not too busy with your social activities", Pitt grinned.
I returned to my room with my head hanging down.
That night, I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone gently tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student union.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, I tried to pretend at a local pub.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick was to prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who had ironically attended what was considered conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're all dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt as homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years ahead of me stretched before my mental eye into a purgatory of rejection and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based at my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was only there a few times.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist perspective on history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here", he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' house, finding refuge with more receptive friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said in a low voice.
They would never do that, not in my dream city of towertops.
Even my Communist friends were always well-mannered.
His wet eyes were blurred.
Give it a shot.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, another history teacher had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", and I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly crushed by shame, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me, calling them "old fools".
The relief was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week for the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a crying cocksucker.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic, it was Oxford -- a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened in London this week, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective that included more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino had always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of the nobility.
The first hall of this exhibition, which will be on view until 3 March, contains a wealth of private letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England, to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from a modest fashion designer in the northern Italian city of Voghera to an international jet-set idol.
Being in love with a noble doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't show their curls on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960's and 1970's, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted to be invited to his house in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Rome's Piazza di Spagna, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His influence was felt in every detail of his apartment, in the decorations, in the food, in the music.
"Everyone felt important and loved", recalls the "top model" who began her career at the 1995 Paris haute couture week.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art", she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
Garavani's life is not a story of madness, but rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 200-foot-long runway that suggests a role-changing experience: the user takes the model's place and walks along the runway to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristó Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Diarahba.
The audience of fashion dolls is filled with names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, and Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Designer, 2006
A lot of these customers say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a gilet jacket and a jacket from the 1971-1972 fall/winter collection.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally being old enough to wear one of his evening dresses...
And then, in the late '90s, it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a necktie that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not fashion-obsessed, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses from the fashion designer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were needed to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, 12 different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the foremost authority on the trade press, this dress was a landmark in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the upper classes".
For years, the elite's "savoir-être" has clouded Valentino, now their best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I've always been impressed by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance", admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace on him".
And this is what a princess says...
The world's most difficult job: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the holders of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health to carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern island of Java, Indonesia.
To do this, he must descend daily to the bottom of his crater, where the sulfur-containing gas that flows from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets over the steep stone paths.
Although it is only 250 meters [250 feet] to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters [2,386 feet], the exhausted riders take more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle speed, keeping their balance and taking care not to slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Once they reach the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run three kilometers in the tiringly heavy baskets to the scales set up by a mining company a little further down at an altitude of 1,850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the volcano's resources and (never better) its workers since 1960, paying them 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulphur.
They then sell it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kilograms, we get about 46,000 rupees ($1,200) for each trip", explains Anto, who normally makes three trips a day.
He takes three hours to complete each course, and by the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees.
What may seem like a miserable wage for such an inhuman effort is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest is 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high", explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, frequent coughing, and irritation of the eyes due to the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life for three years at Kawah Ijen, where sulfur has already left its first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, frequent coughing, and irritation of the eyes due to the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than plain English.
This charming and intelligent but life-threatening young man could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he is doing the work of a doorman.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up at two o'clock every morning because the sulfur flows out at night, where its distinctive yellow color shines blue in the dark.
Defying the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanised sulphur mining to save costs and does not supply any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees ($2.80) per camera that the park's rangers charge tourists for photographing the volcano and the human body, along with the 15,000 rupees ($1.80) entrance fee.
"This work is for the animals, not for the people", protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old hard-working porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can", because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns your throat and itches your eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners get caught in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains of serious illnesses... except, of course, the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, at 53, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Each day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks along a goat path through the bushes to a camp in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life", Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
The oldest of his five children, at 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world: that of those who work as human donkeys at the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame their lack of children on their careers, stress, and the cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a mint candy commercial, but nevertheless - or just because of that - they went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper song, the local proverb for example "Push a bao into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
BBH, the advertising company that made the video, hopes that the commercial will be fun and bring attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their "national duty".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing, so we realized that this was a problem we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like, say, compose a rap song?
1.2 Children
The one who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax breaks.
But everything has been a little bit of a success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population office, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Agency, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have much more options in terms of goals and priorities than just getting married and starting a family", she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counteract population decline has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the little-disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party scored its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unanticipated Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to get so many small apartments built.
It is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square metres and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the single-person lifestyle and discourage construction companies from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger residential units.
They're so popular, and the units sell out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer guidance to developers who have previously faced obstacles in building too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, it is clear from discussions with Singaporeans working in the financial sector that they will not have much of an impact.
"People are under a lot of stress, and housing and education are expensive, so many people are putting it off", says one young manager.
The kids can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time", says another man in his early 20's.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - there's so much the government can do.
The offline private is the offline private online
Privacy policy
According to the dictionary, it is the quality of being private or "that area of one's private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16?
How does this definition apply to his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposing himself to by publicizing situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 who are frequent net users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very special" at a personal level and "on the password and the user" when applying it to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in a post", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world", he confirms.
I upload pictures of games on FB.
I also spend time with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or someone else's fooling around", he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos of nudity, crime, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends on Facebook and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone is answering me, I'm just uploading them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk quickly with distant relatives or friends", he says.
When asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommended a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of that because we have something in common, for example, music", he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any clues or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone is bullying me or asking me to do it, I just remove them from my account", he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unaware of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He just did it in private".
It then explains a series of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like him or if I wanted to fuck him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying", he explains.
The key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in education and learning, believes that to orient children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was originally a search engine, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in education from Yale University and is the author of "Digital Natives and Immigrants", coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and teenagers who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, when we are still learning ourselves", he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue "because we require them to have a defined criterion for what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age when maturity is not sufficient".
"They should also be selective when it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers about privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work", he says.
Porras goes on to mention a few possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to have a photo of you posted, like the one you posted about a friend?
You know what other people are posting about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you tagged photos of parties?
And one more question, do you need everyone to know what you're doing at all times?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet is acting with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks", he explains.
The Commission
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary school teacher, and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening an online user account.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish", he explains.
Guardia says the children need to be reminded of the lesson "You must not talk to strangers".
The UNASUR summit concluded without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which had been announced beforehand and was supposed to be signed by the seven present governments.
The document was signed by the President of the Republic of Peru, who was the head of the UNASUR, and was sent to the UNSC in December of that year.
When asked about the text, they said that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
Press access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, the press room only broadcasted the picture of the presidential meeting without sound with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few pieces of information circulated among journalists were obtained by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press officer.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Peruvian presidency sent the media an email with the summit's "concluding statement", but it was the Humala statement and not the official summit closing document.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite press pressures, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published either.
The official website of the ASPA confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities emphasized that the information systems for journalists were in place, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with Chile and Peru jointly committing themselves to accepting a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins in The Hague on Monday, to hear the pleas of both sides in the trial initiated by Lima against Santiago.
"We will follow and implement the judgment on the differences that we are currently presenting to this International Court of Justice", Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts", added Piñera, saluting Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the ICC came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua which it considered a grave error, had brought an action against the Bogotá Convention, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from UNASUR since 2011 following the ouster of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host, President Ollanta Humala, opened the talks in the morning and closed the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Head of State read the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions had been taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries had been established, with a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
He said that the UNASUR countries "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the Residence Rights Decisions".
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, and measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America, and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not be a triumph, but rather serve to expand our productive capacity and to show our peoples a better future", Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects that are designed to improve spatial connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms", the Peruvian president said in a statement read.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment in the Community.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-establish it in the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasised at the Summit.
In this context, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the regional meeting that he expected to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully address the maritime conflict following a ruling by the International Court of Justice challenged by Bogotá.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)", Santos said.
"We will review all these options - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary", he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are scheduled to meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru holds the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
'South America must learn from the integration of its citizens', says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually having something to learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed each other in World War II and other conflicts" and "today are practically a fatherland".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which the member states of Unasur are pushing forward.
'We must achieve free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past,' he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the restructuring of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those which signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but he followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time, there were "reasonable suspicions that Assange was being extradited to a third country and that his proceedings would not be adhered to".
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his own territory for an alleged sexual offence, while 'Swedish jurisprudence allows this to be done via videoconference, which could have been conducted via the Ecuadorian embassy in London'.
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental state would be affected.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a slight lung problem, but not serious", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
However, there is a risk of physical and psychological harm because of being trapped in a confined space and not being able to exercise outdoors.
"It would affect the health of every person", he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London is to grant him a waiver allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe.
We are not dealing with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings in various European bodies", he explained.
And "If Britain gives this waiver tomorrow, I think this is done".
And if Sweden were to question Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as is permitted by Swedish case law and has been done in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to assert himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the malice and the lies that undermine free speech".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the bad and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail", he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer ruled by such journalists "nor by the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries", and anticipated that in a re-election "the revolution will be deepened to continue the path in this right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must remain tough and not accept opportunism and no coup dressed as legal" because it "has destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay".
The President of Ecuador also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries as "absolutely justified".
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflict is inevitable, but it must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be dealt with comprehensively so that we can overcome them and look forward.
He also expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard".
Regarding the possibility of running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to complete his third consecutive term, he said that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would retire from politics.
I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then I'm retiring from public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"That's settled", he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he had traveled there for a scheduled routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean that President Chávez's health is in any way deteriorating", he commented.
The Ecuadorian President attended the 6th Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of AIDS deaths is now too late to be recognized
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he tested positive for HIV.
"It was like a bomb went off", he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor "tried to defuse without noticeable success".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it, and he did so with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came in 1994 after several struggles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990's when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of one IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it was a dead end".
AIDS was synonymous with death back then.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the hospital unaware of their illness, and the virus has already damaged and exhausted their immune system, and they are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the world's first reported cases of AIDS, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time is exactly the same as the survival of the general population", explained Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV unit at HCG, saying that this information was backed up by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
Infectious disease and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system impairment of individuals at the start of treatment and that those who are not drug dependent have a higher chance of surviving: up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above suggests that a person diagnosed as HIV-positive at age 25 "can live to be 75 years old without any problems, as long as it is under control", the expert explained.
To properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of ONUSIDA), it is still true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and as of May this year, 187 have died, but it is assured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and this is the way it is in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had any problems with the supply of medicines, and the problem is that people come in very advanced states because they don't know their infection status, which is very late in the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a co-infection, and to affect global mortality, we need earlier diagnosis, and so we need to offer massive screening to all those who need it".
This suggestion is supported by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (Council of State for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and also by patients like Fabrizio, who had his test done in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it was done by a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather blow up three times", they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everybody else.
"I work, I do a lot of things, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who are afraid with his testimony today in the context of World AIDS Day.
If they're at risk, they should get tested, and the sooner they know they're HIV positive, the better, and if they know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are huge gaps between health programs and the average citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV issue.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased; they used to be delivered individually, now they give us packages of a hundred, which is good, but there are still people who don't have access to a condom", he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need them for?" is a common question of ridicule from social workers, school guidance workers, pharmacy and health care workers who don't want young people to be exposed, the correspondent assured.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be redirected, with condoms not just behind the counter but in delivery machines in public toilets in facilities frequented by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid for beer and motels, as Governor Emilio González said when asked if condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not like that; the best way is to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity", he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks fourth nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are from sexual contact, 6% from blood and 2% from perinatal transmission.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, because for every recorded case, there are four or five people who don't know.
The United States Court of Appeals upheld a judgment that did not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities, which was achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, setting an ominous precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that is in payment difficulties.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of companies that Mexican law allows are not valid in the land of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the ruling by Judge Harlin Hale in the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas on June 15 leaves Mexican companies helpless in the face of the confiscation of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door for Mexico's largest glass manufacturer to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States on three grounds of inconsistency.
While the judge in the case points out that the creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the New Orleans-based Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit says first that the main case is the commercial bankruptcy case in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of undertakings with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute as the mediator.
Second, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate that the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been authorised.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Competitions).
It is also true that after the votes of the branches had been deducted, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who brought actions against Vitro before the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which hit the country hard.
The González Sada family therefore objects to the same Court of Appeal, so that the vote is taken in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal is filed, requesting review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The crux of the case is that the Court set aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the name of Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) describing the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Commercial Competition Act and pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cross-border insolvency cases which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-sided caramboles: a blow to Vitro and the country.
General account
After months of unsuccessful complaints by the Mexican air transport unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilots' Unions) has finally made progress.
The petition, which was led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accusing it of obstructing justice.
The Authority has subsequently systematically refused to inform the Central Administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 trustee account of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were used to purchase shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management company).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting at a Caribbean University forum over the weekend, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up to this, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) succeeded in uniting the governors of the south-east to oppose the monumental structure which destroyed some protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been filed according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of free expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is putting over 500 million pesos of stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
A group of companies, called Competival, was formed from the leading information technology companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, and its objective is to serve the software cluster market in Central and South America.
The investment is over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world's most famous basketball player, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been involved in the sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few Puerto Ricans have such a large intellectual collection of the country's basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes spent 6 years in this sport, whether as a lower-class player, first-team player, commissioner and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"I've worn many hats in basketball throughout my life, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s", Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photographs and memories of his long career, testifying to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or general manager of the club.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I've been a part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or a coach.
It was a lot of fulfilling years, including five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I bid farewell to a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
"The first thing I did was to get a job, and then Cuco took over from Ortiz, who was a very good manager", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here, and he was employed at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and he said, "I have a very strong, six-foot-tall player.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who had become a citizen and was one of our best pitchers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made Bayamon a champion, Gausse would make another.
The Vaqueros with Gausse championship was granted to him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy's finishes on the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze, if it hadn't been for this Canadian referee, who made us repeat the last play for the second time", Reyes said.
Was that group at the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, like the one that won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and gave the U.S. team a fight, like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
In that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were back, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in 1990 due to a knee injury.
One team that may not have been the best in terms of personality but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy was the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner as substitutes for the players suspended because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was Piculin Ortiz, no doubt.
His numbers at the international level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculin.
And that's without taking into account his career in the different leagues he's played in.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. They were the best coaches in the world.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've accomplished in the League?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which saw the BSN expand to 17 teams in a season in the early 1990s.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and don't meet teams from other corners of the island until the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and play.
At least I can see the results of the required training and training for coaches, officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the '80s, is dead.
He lived to be 81.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas" this year, died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas with him for the Thanksgiving celebration.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made all who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, witty, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily over the years.
In 1995 a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a liver transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Magic Jeannie" on the NBC television station.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly abominable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other figures in their entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?" which was intended to create anticipation for an emotional episode where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in bookmakers.
The series reached a record audience at the time.
When the answer was announced in a November 1990 episode, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who had fired the shot.
J.R. had gotten her pregnant and threatened to make her look like a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others had reasons to want him dead, too.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a treacherous businessman and unfaithful husband who strives to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) introduced.
"I know what to put on J.R.'s headstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of his fans around the world, and he remains in our hearts for those of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success on the TNT television channel a few months ago.
The network said that five episodes of the second season had been completed and a sixth episode was in the works.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be handled on the show.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who performed such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the city of Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his memoir, "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought would hurt or affect anyone in any way", he told the Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an advocate for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I counsel them, encourage them, meet with them before and after their surgeries", he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable at first, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "End of the World"
Every week, the students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudar Armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If anyone were to analyze what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days away, this would be a really good period.
And it reminds us that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor who's teaching this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history, about the "end of the world".
At Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, the students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time", he said, "and the way hypothetical scenarios are presented that lead to a certain human behavior".
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed apocalyptic movies and examined how they compare with real life.
"I've tried to educate students about what's possible, probable, believable and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to offer a course simply titled "The End of the World".
"We don't take 2012 so we always have the option of resetting the course in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent doom", students must study, write projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, so students have no choice but to "work on until the night when the world supposedly ends", Restall said.
The classes were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats", said Restall of his high-performing course, which was filled with 35 students.
We've been getting e-mails from students for weeks before the semester starts asking if there are any seats left.
The students, for their part, assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden School of Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class where this is taught", he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and even less one professor - said that they believed in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we're discrediting it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple, West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries to when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Other places don't think like that", he says.
This is especially true in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responds quickly to the question of whether he knows a course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not involved in the end of the world", he wrote, alluding to a higher court's exception.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days over the years there was talk of the Last Judgment, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to parties about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call a few friends so we can have a laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
