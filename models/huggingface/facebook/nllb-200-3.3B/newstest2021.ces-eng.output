Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, and also hit Škoda
Defender Filip Novak helped Trabzonspor to the title of vice-master in the last round of the Turkish football league.
His team won 2-1 at the Kayserispor stadium and kept third behind Besiktas.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavie, who saved himself, although he conceded 1:3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
The rookie confirms the great productivity of the defender with the seventh goal in this league season.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from the corner hit the ball into the net.
The home team managed to tie the game with five minutes to go, but Trabzonspor took the lead in the sixth minute of the match, when they successfully completed the break four to one.
The damage at the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equals 1:1 after the solo.
Rizespor did not hold the tie for long, but he did not regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents behind him, he remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will conclude with Sunday's champion Basaksehir duel at Kasimpasy Stadium.
The well-kept cave of the hermit in the forests of Novy Bor was in fact uninhabitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Luj Mountains, near the New Forest in Českolipsko, in the forests that led to the Grafovice, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Both natural and man-made.
And we're going to go after the man-made one.
The place is called the hermit's cave.
But in fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely, a hiding chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock and accessed by a staircase from above.
But until the last moment, it's practically invisible.
Only a narrow stairway leads to a rock gallery, from which the entrance to the rock is visible.
Although the chamber appears to be far from human habitation, at the time of its creation, there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest now stands.
"The fact that the object has no windows and that there is no fireplace in the traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could have survived the winter here", explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-story structure has only a stone counter at the back, apparently for storing dishes.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field", adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
Crushing a sandstone with a spike was fairly easy and quick for the initiated.
It was enough to use the sparks properly and to gradually remove the sandstone.
The length of the tip mark and the method of cutting can be used to approximate the time of formation of the cave.
According to historians, it probably dates to the late 18th century.
The cave is open to the public and, according to the mess that appears in it, there are occasional overnight stays in the present day.
If you approach the cave from one of the forest roads and are taken by the stream running below the cave and the nearby county road, you will find a path down as well.
And on your way out of the forest, you might be caught by the nearby Raven Rock.
Jock Minarick is in a coma after a bad fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best hands now.
The institute is equipped for such cases, plus we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This makes my situation and the care of my daughter Fynu much easier", said Minařik's wife Katja, quoted by the Jezdci.cz website.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip needs time to recover.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who's ever dealt with the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient and give him time", said the 45-year-old jockey's wife.
The call for financial support for the injured Minarik was also tweeted by the star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, equaling the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70,000 euros have been raised on Gofundme to date.
The target is €100,000.
The video referee took four goals from Sassuolo's players, they lost 0: 2
Sassuolo's players got four goals in the Saturday match in Napoli, but they had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consulting the video for offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record-breaking disaster of technology, never before has a VAR foiled a team with so many interventions.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the traffic radar and punished him like no team has ever done.
The new technology is breaking records", commented the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.
"Sasuol's unrecognized goals festival.
The VAR has never been so strict on one team", added the newspaper Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the eighth minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
However, the goal of Filip Djuricicic was not recognized due to an offside after the video-decision player's intervention.
For the same reason, neither Djuricic's next interception and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenica Berardi paid off.
The home side added another goal.
Electric cars are reporting a new record.
The biggest in history in the Czech Republic
"The growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars", said the head of the ČEZ clean technologies department, Tomáš Chmelík.
Other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of electric cars Tesla, but also supermarkets Billa and Lidl, claim to have a share of the market.
The operators of the conventional service stations are represented by MOL.
It doesn't have a number yet.
"We started building our electric mobility network only last year", explained company spokesperson Jana Jusková.
However, the newspaper's editorial staff exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13,5 kWh from the stations.
That's equivalent to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Excluding small charges of up to 1 kWh, the average charge time is two and a half hours.
The vast majority of the refuelling was then carried out on a free rate basis.
If motorists paid for the collection, their typical expense was about $40.
Electric mobility is especially popular in the capital.
Prague is home to all five of the most popular electricity generating stations of ČEZ, which are so popular that they overshadow the entire regional cities.
Olomouc then leads between regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote border stations, such as Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused all day long.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new electric cars were added.
In a large survey by the newspaper "Chesy in Motion", eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only one third of the respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organisers, the government's actions so far in the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more decisive approach.
The event, called The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have, for example, people who are against the expansion of the Turów mine for a long time, people who are against the gravel extraction at Uherský Ostrog, people who are against the construction of meaningless dams", said Marika Volfová, the organizer.
She said the main demands of the protesters were for a plan to retain water in the landscape, a radical change in agricultural policy and subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture and the swift transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"Government is supposed to protect the interests of the people, not reckless and devastating business", she said.
A stall was set up in Malostransk Square with a petition calling on the Czech state to advocate for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring the Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "No more beet grass" or "Less coal, more beets".
Jan Škoda from the association "Water for People" came to Prague from South Moravia, protesting against the plan to mine gravel in Hodonín.
"It threatens the drinking water supply for 140,000 people", he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
He said the proposed quarry is only about 500 meters from the wells and that the assessments are certain to compromise the water quality.
The so-called agro-ecological farmer was Vojtech Veselý from the village of Valeč in Karlovarsk.
He pointed to the advantages of small farms, which do not seek to make a profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agroecological farms are able to feed a population normally, without doing so much damage to the countryside and the environment", he said.
Three people have died in a plane crash into a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in western Germany today.
Local rescue officials have confirmed that two crew members and a resident are among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The penthouse, which was one of five units in the building, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy fire chief Robert Meyboom said that both crew members were presumed dead.
The third victim is a woman who lived in the house, according to the police.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) quoted Mayor Wessel as saying that the victim was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the crash, which apparently served as a landing brake.
The police are assuming it's from a crashed plane.
There was room for two in the plane.
The machine took off from an airfield in the nearby town of Marl.
The newspaper Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before it crashed.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
The WAZ wrote, citing other witnesses, that the plane broke up in midair before hitting the ground.
The Czech Savings Bank mistakenly charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has been corrected
A Czech savings bank mistakenly billed its customers twice for some of their card payments on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already fixed the mistake and refunded the money to the clients.
Problems with double-charging card payments were reported by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Just last night we updated the system and immediately returned all of these double payments to the clients.
At the moment everything is working without problems", said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of customers whose card payments were deducted twice is unknown to the bank's spokesman, who estimates that there were thousands of transactions.
The cause of the problems is being investigated by the Savings Bank.
"It could be a combination of factors", said Dropping.
The Czech Savings Bank is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player on the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
The military on Monday will introduce a three-tiered coronavirus alert system.
"Gradually, the strength of community spread will be at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics", said Vojtěch in ČT.
These will be so-called traffic lights, with regions being marked green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that the inclusion of individual regions would still be discussed with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would have the orange color at present, and Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also show individual measures for district sanitation stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level because the situation is not uniform", Vojtěch said.
Water lily and Caroline
When the waterman Jonas and the miller's daughter Caroline fall in love, it's not easy.
Jonah's love is resisted by his father, the naughty water-man Hastrbuch, and Caroline has no idea that her dear Jonah is not a man.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor, who will do anything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolinka, from that water-devil.
What does it matter if he's scheming and lying?
Especially if he can get Caroline to reject Jonah and give him the courageous Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the night-time Konvička, the rotten flour, the mill fire and other scum.
The villagers, in their excitement, have a hunt for the water-bender, and Jonah's head is the unforgivable curse of the water-bender.
And now, the soul of the Knave, Karolinka, go!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of ČT and in the exteriors at the Brzin pond, in Obdenice on Sedlčansko and in the beautiful environment of the historic mill in Hoslovic.

Most cases are mild, requiring hospitalization for only 3 percent of those infected
Either the Czech Republic is infected with a mild form of the coronavirus, or our yearly dose of sunshine has greatly improved our immunity.
The hospital's infection wards are half empty, even as the numbers of infected people continue to rise.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalized people", confirms Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It's worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked, everyone wore a headscarf, the army was taking out, the republic was closed and the Czechs were consuming disinfectant for the year ahead.
Still, ten people a day were dying.
Now, the daily increase in cases is higher, but every day, COVID-19 kills at most two people.
The highest number of infected per population is still Karvinsko, similar numbers are already in Jihlava due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another senior home has closed down the sanitation department at the Blackheads on King's Lawn.
The disease was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We are shaking, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygienic measures", says the director of the retirement home, Martin Schanel.
According to him, none of the clients at the home have any symptoms of the disease so far.
The field tests will begin tomorrow with the sanitation team, and then they'll decide on the next course of action.
Hospitals are responding to the increase in infections.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today has activated an automatic camera system at the entrance that detects whether people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by the South German sanitation workers who recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of a pharmaceutical company.
A total of 131 new cases were reported on Saturday - half of Friday's total - but fewer tests were being done over the weekend.
The rookie is the champion!
Van den Bergh finished the story, Anderson finished the sweep
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh has put on a superb performance even in a match against a player who won the second most prestigious event within the PDC in 2018.
The match was tied at the start, with the score at 8:7 for the Belgian.
Van den Bergh took the breaker with a 13-pointer and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game, and the more experienced Flying Scot had a hard time getting to the doubles.
And the way the Dream Maker had his back in his hand, the fact that the hotheaded Anderson didn't play his first full game until the 24th.
Plus, the young Belgian was doing a great job with the high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the 11th leg, he was in bad shape, but he "got the big fish" and he closed the 170.
Anderson was showing tremendous frustration at the end of the game.
He was just throwing darts, and his rival, who was walking in triumph, was acting supremely.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning a trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian archer, as it is his first major.
It still stands that the last player to beat Van den Bergh is Karel Sedlacek.
In Nantes, a man has been charged with the burning of the cathedral.
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, severely damaging the original 16th-century stained-glass windows and destroying the organ.
Suspected arson investigators investigated because the fire proceeded through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs of forced entry at the entrances to the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer for the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now, the prosecution has announced that based on new evidence, the man was re-arrested on Saturday, confessed and faces a charge of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man is remorseful and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde writes.
We're going to be introducing the "semafor" for epidemiological measures on Monday.
The new system is meant to serve as a pandemic response plan, the absence of which has led to criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"They will be gradual, according to the strength of community transmission", the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, as the situation in each county varies significantly, he added.
The Ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) to develop the system.
The minister said that specific measures will be taken at each stage, whether it is the compulsory wearing of face veils or the organization of special wards in hospitals.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has called for a "sustainable" healthcare system, and for the EU to be able to take action to address the problem.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been increasing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized cases remains low.
The military commented that nothing major had happened, and it was not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or recalling the crisis staff.
The government, in view of the increasing number of infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, has reintroduced the obligation to wear a headscarf at indoor events over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it's 1,000 people.
The government's move, where until the last minute it was unclear what measures and when they would take effect or when they would be announced, has been met with criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should instead create a sense of security and the confusion should instead be rectified", Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
The measures may already vary from region to region, for example in Prague from Sunday there is an obligation to wear a headscarf even in non-residential medical facilities, for example in pharmacies or in doctor's waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear a headscarf when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí provinces as well.
In the Highlands of Jihlavsk, it is necessary to wear the headscarf in indoor public spaces, in the MHD and in medical facilities from July 14.
In contrast, the anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region of Kutno Gorge.
The Czech government also approved a so-called European traffic light at the beginning of June, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries by colour and accordingly modifies the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low and medium risk countries, as of 15 June, the authorities will not require a negative coronavirus test or quarantine for Czech citizens.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
The Techno Party in Benešov is back.
Playing at a third capacity, due to end at noon
The Technoparty at the Head Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays one-third of the original 12 musical systems.
According to the evening estimates of the police, after 20:00 about 500 people remained here, the original rough estimates were about three hundred, in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Techno party was originally supposed to end at noon on Sunday, and by that time, some of the music systems had actually shut down.
"Some have already left, and others are preparing to leave.
The musical production is still partly ongoing.
We expect that the disconnection and dismantling of music systems will be gradual", said Nováková.
"Police officers are still rigorously checking out departing visitors to prevent drivers driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Drivers have the possibility to undergo a preventive breath test before they leave", she added.
Dozens of police officers are on duty, police officers, foreign police, traffic police, police officers, and emergency services are on standby.
"During the day, police checked 470 people moving in the place of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol", Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by the police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police officers also handled 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the Techno Party participants, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have intervened.
This was stated by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) in the Prima Partie TV programme.
But the number of participants dropped below 1,000, so the police decided that no intervention was necessary, and neither the sanitation station nor the health department requested it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had spread to surrounding land, whose owners had not agreed to use it for technoparty.
It's possible that the owners of the surrounding land will seek damages.
Tech fans came to the meadow near the head of the fox on Friday night.
Police initially patrolled the park in Blazemska, Benešovsk, where the Technoparty was held last Friday.
Blažim is about 20 miles [30 km] from the Lhotka of Glaváčkov, where the technicians actually met.
According to Novak, no one came to Blajimi.
Snake bite: the girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was reported in Iron Mountain.
A snake bit the foot of a girl, class of 2010, who was taken to the emergency services base by her parents", regional health emergency service spokeswoman Mária Svobodová told the newspaper, adding that the child was then transferred to a hospital in Klatove.
The snake is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Šumava that these animals are found in greater numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
But there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of a snake biting you are not very high, with normal contact, it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud hissing noise.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Its bite is not a tragedy either, for its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill humans.
This can occur only if a person has a particularly weak organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is therefore mainly in children, the elderly and allergic people.
"A person who is bitten often feels sick, sweats, has a high temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in weakened individuals, especially those with allergies, it can even be anaphylactic shock", Miriam Gredová of Klatov Hospital told the newspaper.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
He poured wine on a policewoman and threw dishes
After 11:00 p.m., a SWAT team entered the apartment and apprehended the man.
The babies were immediately taken into care by paramedics, said Markéta Janovská, spokeswoman for the regional police, in a press release.
The man refused to cooperate with the police, throwing dishes, knives, or pouring wine out of the window at the police negotiator.
Several times during the negotiation, he amplified his threats by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
One time he even climbed up on the window sill himself, where he was sneaking around.
Police are still investigating the man.
He's not releasing any more information.
Stosurova will put her daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not play in the coronavirus-affected season again this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, but has no plans to end her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year, and he believes that with his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner, Liz Astling, gave birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be around all the little milestones that our Evie is going to have over the next six months, and just enjoy it", the former world number one in fours said on the Australian federation's website.
The WTA Tour will resume its season-ending March 3rd with a singles tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Raid uncovers meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was carrying 1320 eggs of quail of unknown origin, in unsuitable conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of in a waste disposal plant", stated the State Veterinary Administration.
An inspection of the live fish stand revealed that the vendor did not have the documents of origin and was not registered to sell live fish.
The marbled porpoise has long been considered a problematic animal.
For example, last fall, veterinarians discovered an illegal food market in the city, with almost half a ton of unmarked food without proof of origin.
Most of them were not dated, some of them were expired and some were damaged.
Five kilograms of cuttlefish was three years past the expiration date.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers at a market detained 80 kilograms of food without a certificate of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen duck, some of which was moldy.
Putin telephoned Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in Donbass, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect at midnight.
According to the Kremlin statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by Ukrainian and Russian negotiators, with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday, is to be "full and universal" and is to pave the way for the fulfillment of the other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the upcoming elections for local representatives will not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement provides that Kiev will regain control of the border of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to the Unian, Zelensky's office, both statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and on the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining the combat zone or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied peninsula of Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but the occasional gunfire and artillery attacks continue to kill people on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing military support to the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbas his priority, but no major breakthrough in the negotiations has yet been made.
The unexpected master of ten-ball is Rykel, seven-ball is Novotná
Defending the last two titles, Doležal did not reach the end of the Saturday program of the 400, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
The decathlon was dominated by Latvian Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karase, but resigned after the discus.
Rykl has two bronze medals from the outdoor MČR, this time he was the only ten-boyar who crossed the seven-thousand mark.
The other two winners were Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
The competition was called after the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and George Sycora.
"It's a pity the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because then the results would have been very different.
But the title tastes very good, and I appreciate the fact that I got a 12-inch peck at the end.
Then I was pleased with the stick and most of all I was disappointed about the disc, there I was below average", he admitted on the union's Facebook page.
The first day of the meet was won by more than a hundred-point lead by Katerina Cachova, despite being bothered by a broken ankle on her javelin.
However, in the long jump, she only recorded 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters with the javelin, and did not enter the final eight.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořák.
She was especially successful in the long distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wished so much that it was around 630.
Yesterday I started to feel a calf pulling, but I'm very happy that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all", said Novotná on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular because of its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre driven.
Like gasoline and diesel, it has its own eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days we received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be mixed with conventional fossil LPG to be distributed to our filling stations", quotes the association Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or biofuel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum-based LPG that many motorists now put in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix the two versions at will.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the way it is produced", says Ivan Indráček, the association's president, about bio LPG.
This is one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It's easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also pretty good, compared to hydrogen or electricity, for example.
Currently, this gas is produced as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food and sugarcane residues.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, for example from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of petroleum refining and partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of a car running on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation of a car running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it's not the CO2 emissions from the car's exhaust but the ecology of the fuel production, the "well-to-tank" part.
Among the largest producers of bio LPG currently are the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 170 thousand LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment gives a slightly higher figure in the NAP ČM, about 200 thousand.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, last year alone, almost 6,000 LPG conversions were carried out.
In the Czech Republic, LPG can be supplied at approximately 950 stations operated by different operators.
The count of cases has dropped by 1,775.
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to review the numbers of those infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number dropped from Saturday's 5,254 to 3,479 cases on Sunday afternoon, down from 1,775 cases.
So, there are currently 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the surge in the number of cured is the revision of data, which the hygienists have not bothered to update lately", said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with the coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered, and 371 had unfortunately died from Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or postal voting.
A political scientist and a sociologist were looking for alternatives for a pandemic.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), the law needs to be amended so that people in quarantine due to coronavirus can vote in the October regional and senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated procedure.
He said it on Sunday's Prime Party.
He wants to meet with the minister on Tuesday to discuss possible solutions with the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law", Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the legal framework.
But the minister said that the provision in the law that says that people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health condition will need to be amended.
The ban on voting should remain in place for patients with open tuberculosis, for example.
Daniel Prokop stated on the OVM programme that the possibility of a correspondent election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overestimated.
He is personally against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
The Commission's proposal is to set up a European Health Insurance Fund (EHIF) to provide a single European health insurance scheme for disabled people.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The correspondent selection (either in the Czech Republic or abroad) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
They also see the aforementioned electoral units or perhaps the possibility of family representative voting.
He added that it is possible to learn from how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries around the world this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Protesters throw pig's ears at government building
Protesters against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boik Borisov and his cabinet threw pig's ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against "mafia-style governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide lockout on Wednesday, according to DPA.
Today's protest, which is now in its 18th consecutive day, had a smaller turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
By 8:00 p.m., there were about 300 people gathered, and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Protesters in front of the government building staged a theatrical scene, symbolically locking up Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
Resigning from both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced healthcare reform and an end to corruption in the construction of the Black Sea coast.
The protest organiser, Nikolai Hadjigenov, said on public radio today that the "peak of escalation" is coming on Wednesday in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He repeated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call of early elections.
The actual ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said he has no intention of resigning.
The reason for this was, among other things, the need to keep Bulgaria on track in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday, he replaced five members of his government team, though the backsliding didn't calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, the Borisov government abstained in the parliamentary vote of confidence.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovich doesn't want to play matches without spectators anymore.
The coach of the Bologna football team, Siniša Mihajlović, is tired of Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that the fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we're running here right now is not football.
I'm sick of fighting without spectators.
It's sexless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
These fights are worse than practice.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that", Mihajlović said before today's game against Lecce.
The coronavirus break is followed by the Series A games in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, their actors are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in the heat.
You can't even tell what teams are in the middle.
I can't wait for this season to be over.
"It's a very difficult situation, but we're hoping that the fans will be back by September", said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move up a level.
We want to continue to grow, and to do that, we need the players to be mentally stronger", he said.
We have been targeted by cyberattacks by foreign powers, Iran claims
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported at a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said that the fire that broke out this month in the underground nuclear facility in Natanz may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has yet to be explained.
Iranian media reported that Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faced "thousands of cyber attacks" on a daily basis.
He added that this was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, there have been several broader cyber attacks, which the analysis says were "by certain governments and groups".
But he did not give details of the suspects, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries, and other places are common in the summer.
An article by the Iranian state news agency IRNA this month discussed how Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may be behind the recent incidents.
But none of these countries were directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian student militants attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-standing tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have taken a heavy toll on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdhi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8th, Iran fired a series of missiles at bases in Iraq where the Americans are operating.
The U.S. only reluctantly admitted that dozens of American soldiers were wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a leading opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the shutdown of production until May 25th.
The Cologne-based car manufacturer Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended the production pause due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should be restarted on Monday morning, May 25th.
The car will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the carmaker.
Production has been halted due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18th.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the shutdown is that the borders are closed and the dealership is closed, so there's no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100% from the start, i.e. in two shifts.
The company's key markets, such as Italy, the UK and Spain, are affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Kaspar (Colin) said that the shutdown of TPCA is not a sign of life in the city.
"In the beginning, it was familiar, the city was empty.
But the streets are getting crowded, especially since Monday, when things got really loose.
"So the city is full", said Caspar.
He says there's no complications with the foreign workers who stayed at the hostels.
"We had to solve almost no problems in those two months", said Kaspar.
For example, Škoda Auto, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27 at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are operating at 100% capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time since the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2500 people and is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding, leaving a message for the family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson battled a devious cancer, and just when it seemed that she had beaten the cancer, the disease came back.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospice bed, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
The disease has unfortunately died.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved the outdoors.
With her friend Ricky Moore, who she lived with for over 16 years, they traveled to competitions around the world.
The 39-year-old woman was active and healthy, but was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began the grueling treatment, radiation therapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma seemed to have won the battle against cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time to the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then resumed drastic treatment, reports the British daily Daily Mirror.
Of course, it was all for nothing.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her she had only a few months to live.
In April, the beautiful blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged her marriage to her love, Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been made public, it means that I have finally died after weeks of too long a struggle.
Though I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough for being by my side the whole time and giving me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time", she wrote on social media, adding that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social media followers", she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweaty dating cards, sponge charms and even pexeso
For 100 crowns, a passerby can buy a pocket artwork mostly by novice Czech artists.
They create the images and other artwork for the artists, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the size of the 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always contains the curated text about the artist and then the work itself", explains Petra Wižová, the project's curator.
Artmat works on the principle of chance.
The buyer may be surprised to see what artwork he will get.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra Oplova or mini-glass by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
Punx 23 artist in collaboration with Dora Dutkova has prepared a pexeso connected to a walk in Prague.
The cards should be matched to the house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladr and Juliana Chomová sell pocket-sized packages of spirituality: the first is a protective amulet made of a troudnat and fortune-teller cards, the second is a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritistky.
Health care payroll is up five percent next year, tops.
A higher increase is unrealistic according to Vojtech.
Salaries in the healthcare sector could rise by up to five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Questions by Václav Moravce on Czech TV.
The union's demand for a 15 percent raise is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should strive to be self-sufficient in providing protective aids.
He says the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (of wages) could be somewhere up to five percent", the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect on the current situation, since March, the selection of the coronavirus pandemic insurance and government regulations against its spread.
Insurance companies' revenues were down at the time.
"A 15 percent increase seems unrealistic to me at this point", Vojtěch said.
The average monthly salary of an acute-care physician, according to the UZIS, is likely to reach $88,312 this year, and that of a nurse $47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in the state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The ODNI data also show that the shortage of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was 34 125 CZK in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Union representatives already said in June that they would be demanding a minimum raise of ten percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the salaries of doctors and nurses in public hospitals, which must be paid according to pay scales, and the contract salaries in city, regional or private hospitals.
They therefore also demand that the pay scales for medical staff be uniform.
The difference for nurses this year will be as much as seven thousand crowns a month.
But for doctors, for example, wages have grown faster than salaries in the last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should be aware of the current state of affairs.
The House recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit this year to a record 500 billion crowns due to the impact of the COVID epidemic, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the salaries of medical staff in hospitals and social services.
The board of healthcare providers, according to Schmuckler, disagrees with a flat-rate pay raise next year.
He argued that the hospitals and health facilities should decide on the remuneration themselves and that the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective devices.
The chairman of the State Administration of Material Reserves (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective medical equipment in its possession.
He's waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Voigt, suppliers around the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
The smart quarantine could be taken over by the military.
We're ready, they're reporting
"If the quarantine works, it's what to improve, of course.
We're gonna discuss it with the military tonight.
The army is functioning perfectly and the question is whether they should not be in charge again", the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook program Hello people.
According to him, the IT systems and the hygiene stations are not sufficiently connected and they have to gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were according to the Prime Minister in the Moravian-Silesian region, where they are one of the current outbreaks.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek told the CTC that he had no information about the Sunday meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the clever quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, headed by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticized by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He also said that the army could take him back.
The government's commissioner for IT and digitalization, Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, has previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system works, but it's still being worked on.
For 20 years, it's been separate and unsystematic, and now, in a few months, we're trying to unify it.
It's not a jet.
People on the move, the poor people in the hygiene on the move are adapting to the new systems and actually picking up the bugs", he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "fuck politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to "not fool around in politics", he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO's presidium, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the votes.
Macura originally wanted to serve only four years.
"I thought I'd last one term and with my business experience I'd be able to turn things around and get back on my feet", he told Respektu.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent to run for a second term.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to mess around with politics", added Macura, who described himself in an interview as a heavy introvert who does not like to have frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for some time about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for the alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities of ANO, he supported Zeman's opponent, Jiří Drahoš, in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can make a difference in the movement, that it's not a futile struggle and that no one is going to tell me, I have no immediate motive to quit", he told Respektu.
56-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was, among other things, the director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber is returning to Brno as a transportation service
At the end of July, the transport company Uber will return to Brno.
This is the consequence of a change in the law, said on Thursday in a press statement Brno's Transport Councilman Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Uber was protested by taxi drivers in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as labeling as a taxi or taxameter.
However, the amendment of the law changed the conditions for the operation of both conventional and alternative taxis from July.
Kratochwil has had several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On the basis of these, the company decided to return to its services in Brno at the end of July this year.
This move is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to legally operate.
The city has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the limits of the change", said Kratochvíl.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it because of the failure to mark vehicles as taxis or the missing taximeter.
The court issued a temporary restraining order, banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
Now he's coming back because of a change in the law.
From July, it will be easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via a mobile application, in addition to classic taxis with a light and a meter.
A too-flashy celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair was thrown from the fourth floor of an apartment building in Brno on Saturday night and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian walked up behind him at the time, who immediately called the police.
Upon arriving at the address on the west side of town, the watchman noticed an open window, under which a chair still lay, with a few cans and bottles of wine beside it.
"The movement that was coming from the fourth-floor room indicated that a rather noisy party was going on inside.
The officers walked down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between 26 and 29 years, for an explanation", said police spokesman Jakub Ghanem.
The appeal request for Rafaje will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the demand for the motion to dismiss the head of the Antitrust Office (ÚOHS) Peter Rafaj.
The appeal of Rafaj was called for by non-profit organizations for a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council and also by the Ústecký kraj.
The Social Democrats say a change in leadership is in order.
According to the CTU, Rafaj was not invited to the Cabinet Office on Monday.
His second term expires mid-next year, and he can't be reappointed for a third term.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call from the non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister also received a letter from the Usti region with a similar request.
The reason is, among other things, Rafaj's recent affairs.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, saying he would look into the materials and that the government parties would take "any position".
He also stated that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the President, and that he had not yet agreed to meet with him.
According to the OHS, there is no cause for appeal because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote last week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with the mayor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were held in connection with the decision-making process on the competition for the controversial new Zlín hospital project for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
He admitted to the meeting, claiming they were discussing his "senatorial activities".
So does Rafaj.
The Ústí Region's representation called on the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
He also calls for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the OPCW on public procurement according to Deputy State Minister for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police raided the antitrust office over a bidding process.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz server pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written for the company of the influential behind-the-scenes player of the Czech Socialist Party, Alexander Čuba.
The deposit of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the President of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, having been appointed by the President for a second term of office in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year term will be over.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may dismiss the head of the Office on the proposal of the Government.
He may be removed from office only if he has been absent from office for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
The library in Blenna was in a fever.
The air conditioning will help.
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
We go to the library in downtown Blanco with three kids on a regular basis.
But in the warm months, it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was so hot and the air was so bad.
The ventilation didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning", said one of the Blanca readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the library's director, Lukáš Dlapy, temperatures in the building often reached over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
The south wall of the building is glazed, and on sunny days it functions as a greenhouse.
"In addition, the sun is supported by the curvature of the building for much of the day.
At the same time, ventilation in some rooms is a big problem, since windows must be closed at night for safety reasons.
"It's often 30 degrees in the library in the morning", said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs, the exhibition room and the principal's office.
The children's ward, located under the roof of the building, was also affected by the unpleasant climate.
"On several occasions, librarians collapsed at work and became unfit for work.
The problem also regularly arose in the cultural hall at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was hard to breathe", noted Dlapa.
Originally, the city wanted to air-condition all the library spaces this year.
In the end, it'll be three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most troubled rooms will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department on the floor above", informed Jiří Svoboda from the investment department in Blen.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed air-conditioning and electrical equipment in the premises last autumn.
For approximately 360,000 crowns.
The city library of Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of those, about 900 are under the age of 15.
The Chicago beam has been wiped out by the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are as silent as the grave about the health of their players and don't disclose anything.
Crawford was one of the few to stand out.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was only present for the first practice session, and has been missing since.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last 14 days confined to my home", he revealed the reason for his absence.
The fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to go full force again.
"It's great to be back.
I will do everything to get back in shape as soon as possible", he added.
The experienced goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a fixture on the goal line for the tenth straight season.
The Blackhawks are looking to open the season with a home-and-home series against St. Louis, then they'll face Edmonton in the preseason.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Protests have taken place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv, among others.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
The protesters are demanding Netanyahu's resignation due to the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is handling the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home", one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's widely known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the Emperor has lost his clothes", said another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to be sentenced while in office.
He's charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all the allegations and calls it a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people have died from the disease.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March that helped reduce the daily increase in infections.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from late April, the number of cases began to rise again, especially in late June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not done enough to help, for example, businesses affected by the quarantine measures.
Protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing conflicting guidelines in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreck by the fire department.
The tragic accident happened around 11 pm near Neveklov on the narrow stretch leading from the Slapské dam.
The driver apparently ran down into the woods at high speed and crashed the car into a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be removed from the wreck by firefighters, who cut off the roof, among other things.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the accident.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which would, among other things, clarify whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spitting out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi is canceling the discounts and is betting on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi is looking to focus on sustainability, and is embarking on a major change in strategy.
He's cancelling the discounts and he doesn't want to be spitting out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the world's biggest polluters is not new.
Billions of garments end up in incinerators and landfills each year.
But the slow fashion view, the often-disdained approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly in recent years.
Pietro sold approximately half of the goods to the Filipinos at full price.
The other half, which was sold off by the discounts, just won't be buying.
The company doesn't want to be cramming one collection after another and at the end of each season, selling products below their manufacturing price.
Moreover, according to the owner, Michal Mička, the days of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends are over.
"Most merchants count the discounts when they buy the goods, and a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It is a bit of a fraud, then", says owner Pietro Filippi Michal Mička.
Moreover, the company's approach also aims to support local businesses.
"Every product is made from carefully selected high-quality materials and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of what we call basic pieces - that is, clothes that are timeless and out of season.
The lack of any discounts is typical of the premium brands segment worldwide, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and there is no need for discounts", Mička adds.
The giant graffiti is of RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The idea was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I was reminded of our fighter pilot who fought in the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city authorities liked the design,' said Vacek, who finished his work after 14 days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig was sent to the United Kingdom, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, 46, known in the street art world as Camo, has been working with spray paint on the streets of Warpa for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas that were allocated for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna has made landfall on the Texas coast.
Hurricane Hanna made landfall on the southwest coast of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight EST).
It struck Texas' Padre Island, about 15 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, along with local flooding, according to the AP, which has resulted in power outages and property damage, including damage to ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday, and advised residents to evacuate voluntarily.
The strongest warning was for the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the total area is expected to be about 300 miles [500 km] before it gradually moves over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous tides, and occasional tornadoes may pose a threat", warned the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning local time (CET noon), the storm was moving in the U.S.-Mexico border region, with winds of 50 miles per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, winds reached 90 miles per hour [145 km/ hr], but as it moved inland, they gradually dropped to 70 miles per hour [112 km/ hr], removing Hanna from the category of hurricanes once again.
Authorities have urged residents to stay indoors and to take hygienic precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states in the US that is most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the current security arrangements and the need to maintain social distancing, evacuation is also a big challenge.
Temporary shelters have been opened in hotels, schools, and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take blankets and disinfectants to their shelters if possible.
"We're not even close to being done yet.
We are expecting catastrophic flooding", Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, was quoted by the AP as saying.
Forecasters say that up to 300 millimeters of rain could fall in some places within a few hours, and in some cases as much as 500 millimeters, which, combined with rising sea levels, could flood many coastal communities.
Zeman will give the rank of General to Colonel Lipko.
President Milos Zeman will on Wednesday confer the rank of General on Colonel Pavel Lipko.
This is from the Department of Defense's anticipated events overview.
The reason for conferring the rank of Brigadier General is the appointment in August of Lipka as Deputy Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division North-East in Poland.
Lipka is still acting as Deputy Commander of the Czech Army Ground Forces.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehko as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division North-East in Elblag, Poland, from early August, commanding the Allied Forward Presence units in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Řehka became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government has proposed to the president that Lipko be promoted to the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Law on the Military of Profession, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the period of the performance of an elected function or for the period of performance of a service task that the award of a higher rank requires.
The position of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall be equivalent to the rank of General.
A soldier who has been conferred a rank has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
But he's not entitled to a salary adjustment that matches the grade.
The conferral of a rank lasts until the reason for conferring it is forgotten.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional readiness and is a model for his subordinates.
He is significantly involved in the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the army's participation in foreign operations,' the Ministry of Defence said in June on the promotion proposal.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
The announcement was made by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the wearing of the face masks in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on the aircraft will not have to be unoccupied.
It was reported by Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these common standards", Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it had yet to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include requiring passengers from the age of six to cover their mouth and nose, and to observe recommended distance at security checks and airport pickups.
The aircraft must also be provided with sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy middle seats.
Common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
The difference in standards caused confusion.
The Arctic iceberg has set a new record, with temperatures approaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit [22°C].
"The 41-year-old record was broken in Longyearbyen", the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
By evening the temperature had risen to 21.7 degrees Celsius, which was 0.4 degrees above the 1979 record, he added.
At some 2,000, Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Spitzberg Mountains, some 800 miles [1,300 km] from the North Pole.
The Spitzbergs are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming elsewhere in the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, says a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
He says that the average temperature in Spitsbergen has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970's.
By the year 2100, it could rise by as much as ten degrees unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.
The rise in temperature may cause the permafrost to melt, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads, and airports, and causing more avalanches and landslides.
Warming climate is also threatening Arctic wildlife, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the sea ice.
British returning from Spain will face mandatory two-week quarantine
The UK Cabinet also urged the public to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of COVID-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to isolate for two weeks.
The new rules go into effect at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK", the British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries", she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a popular vacation destination.
Among other concerns, the British are concerned about whether they will be paid for their sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day holiday in Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
They've been booked since December.
"We were supposed to bring the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a machinist and I don't think my employer will accept me to be in quarantine for two weeks after returning from vacation", Metro Hunter quoted the newspaper as saying.
There are concerns about Spain that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections in the last 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, with Catalonia, for example, trying to restrict all nightlife and thus prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a new alert on the increased risk of contagion in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The government will discuss the model of power purchase from Dukovan
The government will discuss the model of purchasing electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant on Monday.
The draft law envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the market price for power, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer is the opposite.
The electricity price is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely variant is that people will save money on electricity due to the construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as has been shown several times in the past.
The project has been criticized by environmental groups in the past.
'The purchase price may be below or above the market price of the electricity.
The final impact at the time of the rule's applicability can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the breaker - with lower consumption or according to the electricity consumption - with higher consumption of electricity', the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) stated in the supporting documents.
Havlíček said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and that people would make money on the Dukovan site.
Otherwise, the impact will be tens of crowns per year per family, which, he says, is far less than what people pay in electricity bills every year to support so-called supported sources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could be between EUR 50 and EUR 60 per megawatt hour (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any proposal for a sum, it is to be contained only in the purchase agreement.
The electricity price on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is the most commonly used by traders, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"The difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity of ten euros could be the additional cost of an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it could be the equivalent of a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances including an electric cooking plate and an oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than 100 CZK/year", the MPO wrote in its submissions to the government.
"We live in a time of great turbulence.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us just how vulnerable the global economy is.
Therefore, I consider long-term market price prediction to be a purely speculative matter,' said Tomáš Voltr, CEO of the investment group Energy financial group.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by MPO, or a legal entity owned by the State and entrusted by it, at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the terms of the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated extensions, but not longer than until the decommissioning of the low-carbon generation.
The low carbon generation design is defined as electricity generation with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity grid with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček had previously stated that the new Dukován unit would have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit is scheduled to be commissioned in 2036.
The new Ducati block's funding model was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State at no interest for construction, with an interest rate of 2% for operation.
The opposition disagrees with the funding model, and is also concerned about the possibility of the Dukovs building Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should be given 70 percent of the construction.
The remainder should be paid by ČEZ, which will also bear any additional costs.
In May, Daniel Beneš, CEO of ČEZ, told ČTK that the expected amount for the construction of the unit at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately CZK 162 billion).
The contracts between the state and ČEZ for the construction of the new Dukovansk block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has taken down tourism promotion material in the media for two billion dollars.
The Ministry of Local Development (MMR) withdrew from the comment procedure the material according to which it planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and on billboards for advertising holidays in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (ANO) told the SeznamZprávy.cz server that the material is still being worked on.
The document was brought to the attention of Zdopravy.cz on Friday.
The Ministry of Tourism has justified the plan by the drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, there was a drop in both revenue and media.
The proposal has drawn criticism from both the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for the promotion of tourism CzechTourism for advertising on TV, radio, print, the Internet, billboards or areas at stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to the TV.
Most of it would go to private broadcasters Nova and Prima.
Print newspapers and weeklies would get 400 million and MMR would get the same amount for PR articles, banner ads and videos on websites.
The broadcasters would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of it again private broadcasters.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens, and areas in train stations and subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented", Dostálová told the SeznamZprávy server without giving any further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Marketa Pekarova Adamova, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe this spectacular disdain will get a shot in the eye at the fall election", she tweeted.
Dostoyeva denies that this is actually a relief to the media affected by the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support", she told N Diary on Friday.
She says the $2 billion budget is a guide.
"We're still counting, of course, it could be less or more.
It's work material", she added.
The Save Tourism Initiative does not make sense with a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign", said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative, on Sunday.
If there is a 2 billion crown in the state budget, it should go to the companies, not the media, the initiative says in an open letter to the government.
A draught of life, a cock of beer, and death like a blade of grass
Posmrtné is also the third album entitled A smrt je stébla trávy of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also passed away a year ago, on May 24.
In Fritz's discography, it is the fifth entry and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Fritz's poetry, of which he is an excellent interpreter.
Fritz, born in 1949, was influenced by the American Beat Generation, but he passed this inspiration on through his own personal experiences and very intrinsic expressions of faith.
He was far from agitated, however, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I think in that context Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahrníček, for example), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I'd like to use the words of the Ostravian poet Peter Hruška about Fritsch's long poetic compositions.
"They sent forth a bitter and unending bitterness", writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that sinks ever deeper into the dull vanity of consumerism and greed, ever further away from what its soul was made of - the mysteries of faith, humility and human closeness.
They were the lamentations of a man who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest to others, but who also knew that they could not be abandoned for the sake of general indifference.
The poems reminded me that one may have to lose everything precious, but it doesn't matter how one loses it.
If he sells himself to general decadence, he resigns skeptically, he is terrified and silenced, or he remains until the last moment in a calm and proud persistence in what he believes and loves".
"The wig is not my advisor", said Hammock.
The former Prime Minister and Chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party, Jiří Paroubek, is not a paid adviser to the Social Democracy.
The party's chairman and interior minister, Jan Hamáček, only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said it today on the TV show Prima Partie.
On Friday, the SeznamZprávy.cz website reported that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor.
"We text from time to time, he sends me material and I read it", Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, it was not an official and paid cooperation.
He said the SSSD doesn't have the resources to waste it on such things.
"That I sometimes read his opinion, there are so many people like that", he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "uncovered listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay because he's an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making a big deal of it, he called it a hallmark of this year's cucumber season.
SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek is Hamáček's unofficial adviser.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ustitsa region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell Petr Benda, who is associated with Parubek and served as the deputy chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that he would not comment on the candidate's composition until it was finalized and approved.
Duplantis has a mileage advantage, it's a kick in the ass, the Swedish challenger is running
The 22-year-old American barista has the ambition and potential to be one of the new emperor's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger, last year at the NCAA meet.
"We had a battle a year before, he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight", says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a 5.95-meter run.
But Duplantis has since shot up the ladder and is currently the only one in the highest circles of the arts.
In just 20 years, he became the world record holder, crossing the height bar of 6.17 meters in Torun on February 8 this year, and adding another centimeter a week later in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18, when he graduated from high school", recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from boy to man, "his potential and talent would be multiplied tenfold.
Twenty is a pretty good age to set a world record", he thinks.
Although Nielsen's list of accomplishments is a little thinner than Duplantis's, the American has similar goals.
He has shown his potential in NCAA events, which he regularly won, in February this year, he improved his personal best to 5.93 m. Last August, he won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, in 2017 he fought for the US team at the World Championships, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"My priority is definitely to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name for yourself there", he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead as well at events such as the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games".
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and the other pillars time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five laps into a mere contest for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible any time soon", Nilsen says.
"This kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile of lead in the training room".
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he's going to want to increase it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a disability pension for a son who couldn't do anything.
She's facing trial
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Because of poor health, the court dismissed the sick man and appointed his mother as a guardian, who was also to manage his son's money.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension for her own needs and thus deprived him of 440,000 crowns", police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said, adding that the accused woman was harmed by the fact that as a guardian she had a special obligation to defend the interests of the injured party.
The woman had set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying for her son's medical treatment and necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to buy a car, electrical appliances and to run the household", the indictment states.
That he couldn't use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay the family expenses.
"We had trouble with our household income.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things that the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime", the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say, after finding tools
The finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1,930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of these tools dates back 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here", said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of the State of Zacatecas, lead author of one of two studies on the subject published in Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
Experts believe that the people of the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a great height above sea level, have been living for 20,000 years.
The most widely accepted theory until now was that the first Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Chlovis culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
But this model has been challenged in recent decades by the discovery of several ancient settlements that are between two and three thousand years old.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports 42 different sites across North America that show human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than has been thought.
Some of them might have been shipped to America.
"It is clear that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture", declared anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, in connection with the new findings.
Interest in tickets is still on an optimistic scenario, say the sellers.
Prices are also gradually falling
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Although the interest is still about half of what it was last summer, demand is growing by up to 20 percent each week.
The developments since the crisis, according to the sellers, fulfil the most optimistic scenarios.
The price of airfare is also gradually falling.
The most popular destinations, according to the sellers, are mainly the southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead the way.
The most popular flights are to Split, Croatia, on the Letuška.cz portal.
Of the other countries, the UK is the most sought after, but it's been one of the busiest destinations ever.
The average price of airfare is also falling.
The Letuška.cz portal moved around 6250 crowns in about half a month, 3000 crowns less annually.
This is mainly due to the increased demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85% of sales.
But the prices themselves are falling, and in some European places, like Spain or Italy, they've dropped by about a fifth in the last few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who now buy air tickets with much less advance notice than before, as they fear the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to Kiwi.com's previous reports, the pre-flight ticket purchase time has decreased by about ten days year-over-year.
"This confirms to us the future trend where people will book flights much less in advance, will require more flexibility, will take less risks", said Michal Šindelář, vice president of products for Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average time to book before departure is 21 days.
The Czech authorities have also provided information on the implementation of the new rules on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
Prague Airport currently operates scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer's season, it's about half the destinations.
The grand finale is tonight!
Watch the archery battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC organization has advanced to the grand final.
It will feature the experienced 49-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then bumped into his neighbor in the leaderboard.
But he also got to wrestle James Wade, and in the quarterfinals, he put up a great fight with Simon Whitlock, who had sent home the world number one.
The Flying Scotsman had a tough run in the semi-finals, where he faced Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped from the shovel of the graveyard, dominated in the prolongation and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he had already dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljović in a great battle 21:19.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on a totally fantastic wavelength.
The 26-year-old shot-stopper first surprisingly knocked out world No. 6 Nathan Aspinall, then overpowered Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and then, after a sharp climb, defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals.
The big test was the semi-finals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength from the start, but the Belgian, who was playing calmly, then made a great series, which he held until the end, more or less without problems.
Van den Bergh showed his power in high scoring, which exposed the occasional doubling uncertainty.
Coronavirus cases have increased since at least the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first detected in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been confirmed to have been infected.
Of those, nearly 9,600 have recovered, and 368 have died.
Currently, there are 5,254 people who are sick.
That's according to the Department of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has quadrupled to over two hundred.
The peak was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 tested positive, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first day of this week, 169 new cases were reported.
The Czech Republic has recovered 9,590 people from COVID-19, or 63% of all those infected so far.
Most of them had a mild form of the disease.
The hospital has 151 coronavirus patients, according to the latest Ministry of Health figures, 19 of them are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
The highest number of infections in the last seven days per 100,000 population is still reported by Karvinka, almost 59.
Jihlava counties are next with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 cases per 100,000 population in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear the veil at indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, cultural and sporting events, as well as weddings and funerals inside buildings.
Starting Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current 1,000 people to half.
The number of people worldwide who have been confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus has already passed the 16 million mark.
This is according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the pandemic globally.
The number of victims who died of COVID-19 is approaching 645,000 according to this source.
The latest million infections added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark was reached on July 22.
The United States, which has already registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, have been the biggest contributors to the rapid rise in cases in recent days.
The number of infected is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases were reported worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic.
This is due to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the US, Brazil and India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has increased in the past week in almost 40 countries around the world.
This is true of Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium, and Israel.
The virus has been found in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially reported today by the DPRK.
The air inside a home is up to five times worse than outside.
Both air fresheners and deodorants are harmful
Not only is the air quality outside poor, but so is the air quality inside.
This was noted by Israeli public-health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel's Ministry of Environment, domestic pests need to be targeted at a time when many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham pointed to research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that shows that indoor air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor indoor air quality.
"Due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people are spending more hours indoors than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality", Abraham said.
In Israel, she says, "the quality of the air in the home" is almost unheard of.
But the things that a person comes in contact with on a regular basis - paint, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"The clothes we regularly take to the dry cleaners also emit the poisonous gas", said Abraham.
The most at risk are children, elderly household members, and people with respiratory problems.
Normally healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headache, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all pollutants come from household items, but the materials used to build homes can also be sources.
How long he spent in prison and what led him to write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada was denied a chance to progress to the Spanish top flight due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The competition administration canceled the previously postponed final round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the play-off.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more cases on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive COVID-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to the infection in the team, Monday's match against La Coruna was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had just one point to get into the play-offs.
The competition authorities have announced today that the duel against La Coruna has been definitively called off due to a higher power, as it has never been played again.
Fuenlabrada has accepted the decision.
La Coruña, on the other hand, is rebelling against the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a win over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round was not played out in full in a uniform term, as is customary.
The management of a former elite Spanish club is threatened with a lawsuit for dropping to the third division.
The first two teams of the table, Huesca and Cádiz, are guaranteed to advance to the elite.
For the remaining third place in the play-off, Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will face each other.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
His daughter Dominica found out
"Dad hasn't had it for many years", revealed Got's eldest daughter Dominika to Aha! with the fact that Master couldn't come up with a name for Havel and whenever he came up with a name, Karl always said it would annoy him.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominique, the feud started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution, "It was easier than him.
That Havel could write in a drawer during the dark times, but if he objected, his career would be over", Gott claims.
But he adds that the Czech giants have found their way to each other.
"I know the word Havel couldn't hear at all in his 60s.
Then the president sent him a birthday card, and suddenly Dad's relationship with him began to change", recalls Dominika.
In fact, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era in their relationship, because then my father would regularly invite Mr. Havel to his home on Bertramck", added the blonde, whose father had died last October.
He also said that he regretted never receiving a state decoration from Václav Havel.
But he did receive it in 2009, even though it had already been handed over by his successor in office, Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive further honours in memoriam, as the current President Milos Zeman, 75, is to award him the Order of the White Lion in his memory.
Since Tuesday, the Czech Republic is threatened by heat, meteorologists warn of fires
The weather forecast warnings for high temperatures apply for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of the Czech Republic, with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region, and also for southern and central Moravia.
"Extraordinary temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in the central Czech Republic", they state.
People are advised to keep to a drinking regimen in the heat and to limit physical activity during the noon and afternoon hours.
Due to warm weather with minimal precipitation, there will be a risk of fire starting Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could be contributing to their rapid spread.
The meteorological warning about the risk of fires concerns the central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ustice, Karlovy Vary and Plzeň regions.
The fire warning will be in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect significant precipitation to reduce the danger in the northwest and west of the Czech Republic until at least the end of the week", states the CHMU.
Prague's city hall has responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the lighting of fires in dangerous places, which is to take effect from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in, for example, parks, gardens or forests within 50 metres of the edge of a forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will remain in force until the appeal is over, said Vít Hofman, spokesman for the Prague Magistrates' Court.
