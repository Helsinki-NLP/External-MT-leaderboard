Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, coming to 29 percent overall
A noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties resulted in the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first provisional results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously in jeopardy.
By contrast, the election director of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is gearing up for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it is losing 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP fared even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austria's post-war history, and particularly for the People's Party, which had called for early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But voters probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers say that could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's executive committee.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, that is, to a renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats simultaneously expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated, when the People's Party had reached agreements with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) regarding a joint government, which had even provoked sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is prepared to cooperate with any party, is clearly counting on this development and assumes that he will return to Austrian federal politics in Vienna.
In addition, the Green Party entered the parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party is likely to have passed the four per cent hurdle and, as a result, has not entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting bugs, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasised by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clarified, then certainly there will be some cooling," he said after a meeting held at the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherdzhi said after the talks that it would be difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of everything, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government wanted to work with the local government in Dardjiling, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years imprisonment, Mukherdji believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could then apply for bail and await sentencing, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had said the same thing during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he would be eligible for a pardon," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the accused, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said, such assistance is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit it, "Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, he told his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister dodged a question on whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to look into the matter.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he said.
A Czech judge on the struggle for the seabed
He approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent maritime areas.
But he is not interested in the continent, but in a small dot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, together with it, the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself, "said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-person team of the UN Oceans and Maritime Rights Division.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is following the interpretation and supplementing it to and fro.
There is work ethic and enthusiasm here.
The seabed hides a little-known world rich in natural springs.
Oil, ore and other non-renewable raw materials can be found here, as well as previously unknown living organisms, which hold the key to the development of a drug against cancer, for example.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the neighbouring states vehemently declared their claim to the new maritime areas.
In fact, under a UN Convention, they are exercising the rights they agreed to in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
It mainly concerns the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its soles that is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the boundaries of the sea shore, often also the boundary of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, "Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf must be backed up by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many expensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded, "Mikulka adds.
Recently, the success of Australia, the first country to significantly expand its maritime territories, met with an international response.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the seabed area approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, they promise, be invaluable.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They will be able to do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the 'Montego Bay Agreement'.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which the Convention calls the "common heritage of humanity," begins.
In this case, no state will have a special position any more.
The right to promote in this field is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold mining country," Mikulka says with a little exaggeration, adding that its "individual areas are clearly defined by law and the system is enshrined in treaties."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organisation "Interoceanmetal."
As a result of the Convention, the latter, like the investors of a few other countries, was granted the status of a so-called "ground-breaking investor" in 1991.
The organization has the right to promote ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is structured there, it is a kind of Tatras on the seabed.
"You can extract there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "said another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concretion as a sample.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary Schem that, according to legend, brought the golem to life.
German special forces were on the scene when hostages were freed
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When things got serious, the special forces were on standby, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are emerging about the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, specialists from the Bundeswehr as well as officials from the GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief were at the site of the liberation.
However, ministry spokesmen said on Monday evening that the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their captives go and fled when they saw signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government had accepted the help offered by Germany in order to involve them on the ground as support forces.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
Attackers kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and her eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were taken back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identities of the hostage takers remained unclear, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out on an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the US Congress narrowly failed to pass the $700 billion financial rescue package.
The Dow Jones plunged.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout of the financial markets.
Despite pleas from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program aimed at stemming the chaos in financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on lawmakers to approve the plan, even if it was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
The Dow Jones plunged more than six percent, or 600 points, during the session.
This was due to investor concerns that the government's rescue package might fail.
It recovered shortly before the end of the vote, only to crash again after the failure was announced.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
For the programme to come into effect, it needs the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record rising bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover of travel bookings for the coming months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, Germans' appetite for travel remains undimmed, according to a study.
As the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in bookings for the winter season compared to the same period last year.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, bookings have already increased for the autumn months.
The DRV reported that the turnover growth of the travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and extrapolates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, especially trips to the USA are in demand, the DRV announced.
Here the increase in bookings amounts to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic regions are particularly popular destinations with Germans.
Package holidays, in particular, are very popular, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs here are "more calculable for the customer than for individually organised holidays."
Consumers could save money through early-bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will be an increase in turnover compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann apres ski hits in an endless loop, beer from litre mugs and celebs in designer dirndls.
A Oktoberfest debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailored dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But there is one thing that unites us: barely three minutes on the Oktoberfest, and the photographers are already pouncing on us and taking pictures of the memory cards - very flattering on my first visit to the Oktoberfest grounds.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As a Oktoberfest tourist and actually located north of the Weisswurst equator, the feeling of well-being in the traditional costume has so far been limited.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndls or leather trousers; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndl apron.
A lady from Munich points out to me that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hand free, middle virgin, right hand forgiven, widowed at the back."
Secretly I freeze the loop from back to left.
"Fits," he said, laughing.
Others make less effort with subtle flirting techniques and wear plain felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch out their naked backsides uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with an elongated "ooooo."
That's what he tells me after getting rid of his previous drunken antics.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild beasts."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the fairground, who have to take care of the poor gullible.
The nurses always perform in a pack - always four at a time lugging a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like with most visitors to the Oktoberfest: Empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarp in the per mille coffin is not visible.
"These are the ones who are not packing," one of the paramedics shouted at me when asked and disappeared into the fray.
Name of crash victim released by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been revealed.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road in the city centre on Friday afternoon.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the accident.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey broadens diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks tell you.
The building sits astride the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front, making it look like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart about
But once inside the arched ticket office, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost entrance it was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a latecomer in the imperialist game, intended to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans faltered during the First World War.
Its railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train blew up, destroying the elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely ignored by history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line serves, symbolically at least, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything to the east, highlighting the widening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighboring regions created by the Cold War borders has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the fundamentals of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same old world pace in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city for the new secular state project to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
But the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has aroused some mistrust in the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP's headquarters, a purpose-built, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, gathered to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbors.
The Cold War was an exception, "he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
"But surely," I asked, "Turkey might eventually be forced to make up its mind?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, figuratively speaking, Europe as a whole can travel east towards Asia and the Middle East on the same railway tracks.
Back at Hydarpashas station, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited at the pier for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11 obituary) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to the age of 21, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form-changer) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted solely of the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which never waned over the years.
How often did Death urge us to "let the music speak for itself."
He used to say: "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never bossy but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have written reviews of over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by a single one - I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He loathed conductors who, in his words, simply "peddled with one or two well-known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research fellowship... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion drawn from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End," but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry."
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the strength they radiate, how they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments. '
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this wide-bodied sedan offers a much larger interior.
In addition, there are the technical refinements that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel savings.
Changes before the coming revolution.
So is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new Jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this large sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new spatial flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before starting to analyze the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appeared six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to initial observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and again in 2008.
After the Jazz appeared on the market, around one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, or 17% of the assumed growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the store managers in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the drop in sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to finish the year with total sales of 22 000 models, 4 000 fewer cars than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the release of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 metres in length, of which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, with the remainder distributed to the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, and its public presentation will take place for the first time in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 metres (plus 2 centimetres) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 metres, which leads to the assumption that it has increased by 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous Jazz model.
Also the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading space, reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 liter gasoline engine, because the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 liter gasoline engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional features such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, whereas the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of petrol engines: 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first 1.2-litre variant delivers 90 bhp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp 1.4 model has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Car bee 'that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan drew inspiration this time from nature, or more precisely, from bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in technologies for accident prevention.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co. technical development center developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R & D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of Nissan's four-layer safety shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped cabin, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's multi-faceted eyes, which can see at an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
In order to simulate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two meters away from the BR23C and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately translated into signal to avoid collision.
'As soon as obstacles are detected, the little robot will mimic the flight of the bee and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer on the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot move upwards or downwards, nor can it move overhead; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that enables it to turn its wheels, and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to help the small robot avoid collisions.
'This device only needs a few seconds each to process the information and act on that information, 'he said.
It does not require storing neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of disk space.
This sounds surprising, but it is not about the GB and not even about the MB of the disk space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for immediate collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars in the next decade.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead to the destination while driving, avoiding obstacles on the way.
She is shaking before she is charged with a mortgage.
It must be understood that the US Treasury, other than having sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
In the run-up to the crisis, and in order to prevent US citizens from getting involved in the mortgage stories of supposedly insolvent banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it is said.
Or, perhaps, the "hotel of bad credit" or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think once, twice and up to three times whether it is the time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for the teens than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen when the game expands?
Now, when a dreamlike room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to issue $9 billion, taking over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a sharp fall in its share price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a single price of $25.25, for a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share price as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible shares, which will give it a 10% gain and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global deal will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley shares fell 6.79% to $23.07 by 5pm GMT.
'This strategic tie-up represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to holding bank status, 'said John Mack, chief executive of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted that status last week, allowing it to expand its operations into new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms unveiled on Monday also show that the deal has changed in recent days: last Monday, Morgan said it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago, 'Tokyo-based Toshihide Mizuno, chief executive of MUFG, said,' we thought the stake would be made up entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal is expected to reduce earnings by about 20% per share.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares in one year's time if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the sale value, or about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to give more details about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should have a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had lowered its balance sheet 'significantly' since the end of August.
Recent weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its share price fall by half while the price of insuring against default has soared.
That price fell on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buyout of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Rebuild the Republic around 21st Century Socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales, and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
It was the Third, following the example of his peers and friends, who put the plan for a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results amounting to 80% of the votes, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left blank.
For the constitutional project to be adopted, one vote must be more than half of the total number of votes cast.
On Sunday, two exit polls and a count by a non-governmental organisation had predicted a clear 'yes' victory, with 63% to 70% in favour.
On Sunday night, Rafael Correa called for the victory of his constitutional project.
"The constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly," he said in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, congratulating Equatorial Guatemalans.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held quietly according to the Organization of American States' observation mission, was based on a 444-point text to secure the 'new socialism' championed by the president.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy, giving it the sole right to 'plan development' in a country that largely subsists on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and on the foreign exchange that emigrants send to the country.
The project, promoted by Correa, who was elected in 2006, also gives greater power to the head of state, who will be able to serve for up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the option of dissolving the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power to seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also safeguards the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the hijackers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned safe and sound to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base directly adjacent to Cairo International Airport around 3: 30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without speaking to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a district for foreigners in Cairo, for examination.
They are all in 'good health' and no ransom was paid to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
After being captured on 19 September during a jeep safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces launched the attack at night, just before dawn, from aboard two helicopters.
'Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled, 'said the official, who wished to remain anonymous.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
From Belgrade, where he is, the head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported on the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
'We have to acknowledge that we achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and capability of our men from the intelligence and special forces, 'he said without giving further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The previous evening, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped an all-terrain vehicle during a patrol in which the kidnappers were located, killing six of them, including the leader from Chad, and arresting two.
The army said they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which it immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the funding of culture is making headlines and is at the heart of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who is going to stand up and denounce the pitiful sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving to death?
What politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government is allocating EUR 3.5 million solely to the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have written in their country's Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members of Parliament and all governmental districts, in coordination.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, assembled in 211 historical societies, work hard to study history, save the numerous private archives with a few pennies, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the force of despair as patrons and decision-makers unleash their bulldozers on our ancient stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to lend their support to the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been thrown into turmoil by the US financial crisis: the three states are making a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the European Commission's competition authority.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first casualty of a year-long international financial crisis, so decisions now being taken about the bank could set a precedent.
Under Sunday night's decision, all three states will buy about 49 percent of the bank's shares.
The bank is expected to sell some of its holdings, most notably the insurance business it bought from ABN Amro of the Netherlands last year.
Fortis shares began a steep slide last week, with serious crisis scenarios already looming in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is far too big to fail.
The institute's shares fell 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current share price, the Group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
Management believes that the US $700 billion bailout and the uncertainty it has created in the markets are to blame for the slump in Fortis shares.
However, prices rose slightly on Monday.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the Bank's new Managing Director.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, meanwhile, sought reassurance - no investor should tremble for their money, it was said.
No panic has broken out among customers so far, and the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also owns leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
Because of a person's drug use, life and health insurers in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of medication data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, or we'll leave the fox to the chickens, "The Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the developer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies set the fees and the amounts payable in the event of damage according to the health status of the customer, and if the risk is assessed too high, the insurance is not taken out in the first place.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the customer's identification number, he obtains data from pharmacies over the last year and a half, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from this what illness the customer suffers and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatably high, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as migraines and hot flushes, but also for depression.
The latter is, from the point of view of insurers, a high risk factor, whereas the aforementioned ones are not.
For the retrieval and processing of the data, separate societies have been formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of patients "health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of its use is becoming more difficult.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only applies to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, which would allow the agencies to control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned is unlikely to be able to prohibit access to his or her data, as insurance companies would otherwise not conclude a contract with him or her.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
Global Menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic, among other global problems, at the Ninth Summit.
The Franco-Indian Summit is also taking place today, where the main topic of discussion is cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more voice and voice on international issues, member states have so far been unable to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached according to which trade is to be doubled over the next five years, i.e. to a good 100 billion euros.
Given that trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even that ambitious.
It is in this spirit that the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have been legally merged into one agreement, so that aviation will also be boosted in the future.
India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
These included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, which both sides condemned in the strongest possible terms, and the convening of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for its failure.
The EU underlined its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which aims to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the proposal to reach some kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to cut greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, which is why both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian leader is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign a bilateral agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, meanwhile, it is hoped that contracts worth EUR 20 billion will be awarded to French companies to build nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th International Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to attend the current event, which will be spread over 171,790 square metres of the fair and feature over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour at the event.
The undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Maria Giro, will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the Exhibition Hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia."
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair, where figures, trends and perspectives on publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing across the board, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane found missing a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, has been found.
The items were found on a high plateau at an altitude of 3000 m, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson quashed any lingering doubts during a news conference, saying, "The plane has been located and a squad has been dispatched, and now we have the certainty that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead on Feb.
The US National Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) announced that just a few hours after the plane was spotted, a team was sent to identify the plane: the Bellanca 8kcab, which went missing on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had taken off from Yerington, Nevada, on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These were two IDs bearing Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had carved out a place in history through a long succession of records.
In 2002, at his sixth attempt, he became the first person to circumnavigate the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single, non-stop flight.
Among his numerous records is also a high altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, this one however with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that stands out from the rest of the traditional layout thanks to its original design and special lines, its expansive surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector with this off-roader.
Precisely because of its extraordinary characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October, will also be unconventional.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the release of the new model will also appear in a new guise, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A high-cost project to be carried out in various phases, which will occupy the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole thing a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments in order to reassemble itself as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes "intention with this advertisement is to introduce a new kind of car advertising into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto - now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, of whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia," which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, to be honest, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been clashes with opposing fans before.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The patrons come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined in Sofia by other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia.
They wear the tricolors on which the militants' towns appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly far-right fan scene, that of Levski.
Figc had made 144 tickets available to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all inspected by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been charged in this regard, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified during the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will not set foot in a stadium again.
Thankfully.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycats, who could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and there is no way to justify such behaviour," the statement said.
Therefore, "Eyes on especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, Puglia is home to a small nucleus of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervision) meets, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, that is the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce shouts and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who in recent weeks has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he took over from Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now come from.
While it is true, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, there is no doubt that the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are punished in the country of their deeds.
Until now, this group had been kept in check, but now we need to reconsider what has happened and will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during the Mamelis anthem: this too is not a criminal offence, but allow me, because there is no education.... "
