Right - wing populists win in Austria , totaling 29 %
The two parties of the Great Coalition have been felt to be weakening and a significant strengthening of right - wing populist parties , according to the first preliminary results , the elections to the Austrian Parliament were held on Sunday .
The Austrian People 's Party ( ÖVP ) , where the current president Wilhelm Molterer 's position was seriously shaken , suffered a particularly strong loss .
In contrast , the Alliance is the president of Austria for the future ( BZÖ ) , the provincial chief of Carinthia , Jörg Haider , who is preparing for a return to national politics .
The country 's strongest party remains 29.8 % of the votes , but the last election in 2006 lost 5.5 % of the votes .
The ÖVP was even worse , which lost nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent .
These are the worst results of the postwar history of Austria , and especially the People 's Party that has brought forward the elections , the result is literally disastrous .
At the beginning of July , when the ÖVP coalition left , the people ’s party had a significant advantage in the SPÖ , according to the polls .
However , voters have clearly punished him for letting the government fail .
Speculations were made about the possible resignation of party president Wilhelm Molterer and current vice chancellor in the first reaction to the results .
Observers believe that this can take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency .
This development would probably make it easier to get out of the election results , or the new SPÖ and ÖVP big coalition .
Given the strengthening of the two right - wing populist parties – the Austrian Freedom Party ( FPÖ ) , in advance , acquired 18 percent of the votes and eleven percent of the votes – the Social Democrats , however , expressed their fear of the repeat of 1999 , when the People 's Party agreed to a joint government with the populists ( FPÖ was still united in 2005 , it was replaced by the BZÖ ) , which even brought sanctions from the European Union .
Haider , who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party , and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics , obviously , is expecting this solution .
The Green Party also entered the parliament , which lost somewhat popularity , and fell back from third place to fifth among Austrian political parties .
None of the other parties exceeded the four percent limit and did not reach Parliament .
Schwarzenberg : Indian relations may get cold
If the Czech scientists reported for illegal beetle collection were not able to solve the problem , Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that in Czech - Indian relations certain estrangements could occur .
This was published by the Minister in New York after meeting with Pranáb Mukherjivel , Indian partner today .
" If this were not resolved , then yes , certain estrangements would occur , " he stated after the meeting , which was carried out by Czech incentive .
After the trial , Mujji said that the executive power could hardly intervene in court matters .
However , he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha , who was acquitted of charges and fined , the central government could negotiate with the local management of Darjeeling , which is subject to the law of the case .
" His problem could be solved , " the minister said .
According to Mukherdji , the three years in prison , however , it would be best to appeal to a higher court .
Then he could apply for bail and wait for the verdict , explaining .
Schwarzenberg proved that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial .
" He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court , it would be possible to acquit him , " said the Czech chief of diplomacy .
The only way to intervene in the whole case is to provide the prisoner with " competent legal support " , the Indian Minister mentioned .
At the same time , he said that the Indian party had already provided such assistance .
" Our main interest in India is to preserve the best relationships with many years of tradition .
This is also recognized by the Indians , ” Schwarzenberg mentioned .
As ČTK said , the Czech Republic has stressed to its partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists .
" We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a grave mistake , " he stated .
The question whether the Indian party has received a promise to take the case was avoided by the Minister .
" I 've been given a relatively large number of promises , " he noted .
Czech Judges in the Battle for the Sea floor
It enters the wall electronic map , showing Australia and neighboring marine areas .
He does n't care about the continent , but one in the blue of the ocean is missing .
" The island belongs to Australia and the neighboring seabed is with it .
The area is as big as the continent itself , " says Luigi Santosuosso , Italian lawyer , who belongs to the United Nations Ocean and Marine Law Unit .
Boss , Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka , director of Division , monitors the explanation , which he sometimes complements .
There is work and enthusiasm .
The sea floor is rich in natural resources , and it has a world that is barely known .
It can be found here in petroleum , ore and other minerals , but so far , there are also unknown living organisms that can be the key to developing a drug for cancer .
Sea floor larger than land
The coastal states are now intensely seeking new areas under the sea .
The United Nations Convention states that their rights were enforced , which was agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay , Jamaica .
It is primarily the area of the so - called continental pedestal , which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country .
Such a country has exclusive right to all the resources of the continental pedestal under the Convention .
" In simple terms , we hold the part and bottom of the continental pedestal , which is a natural continuation of the underwater continent .
On the coast of the sea , often 200 sea miles go beyond the border of an economic zone , ” explains Mikulka .
The application , submitted by the country to the Committee on the external borders of the Continental Sable , shall be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on numerous costly research and measurement .
This is the result of many years of preparatory work .
" One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee .
The committee has already negotiated five applications , Russia , Brazil , Australia , Ireland and New Zealand .
So far only the last three countries mentioned have succeeded , ” says Mikulka .
The world 's success has recently caused an echo of Australia 's success , which was the first to significantly expand its overseas country .
But New Zealand also won - the sea floor area awarded by the Committee is about 1.6 million square kilometres , that is , six times larger than the territory of the country .
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the research .
The profits from the future use of the seabed will be invaluable , according to their hopes .
Other countries are constantly submitting their applications .
They can do so within ten years of the time of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention .
The area of the ocean floor , declared by the Convention " common heritage of humanity " , is where the continental pedestal ends .
There is no exclusive position in any country here .
The right to extract is granted by the international institution established by the Convention in this area .
" The seabed is not Klondike , " says Director Mikulka , saying that " certain areas are legally clearly defined and regimes are signed " .
Chehek in the Pacific
Some of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic .
This former Eastern Bloc shares with other countries within the common " Interoceanmetal " organization .
This organization received the so - called " breaking investor " status in 1991 , similar to investors from some other countries .
It is entitled to produce Mexico , Hawaii and Kiribati , located between ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean .
The area under investigation by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia .
The bottom of the sea is divided , it 's a kind of sub - sea copy of the Tatras .
" A total of 75,000 square kilometers of land can be extracted .
The area is a rich site of polymetalic ore containing nickel , copper , cobalt and manganese , " mentioned by another lawyer , Hindu Pakshi Rajan .
Rober Sandev , a Macedonian member of the division , presents another example of concretion .
It reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy of a parchment with the spells that bring Goliem to life .
German special forces were present in the release of hostages
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the experts came .
When the situation became serious , the special units were ready , but their operation did not take place .
The release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt is becoming increasingly clear .
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior , German special forces were involved in the rescue .
According to this , besides the German Federal Army specialists , GSG 9 , the German Federal Police Air Force , and the staff of the Federal Crime Office , as well as logistics experts from the German Technical Service , were at the scene of the rescue .
According to the information of the ministry spokesmen on Monday night , German forces were not necessary , however , because the hostages allowed their prisoners to run , and fled when they recognized signs of forced rescue .
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the spot .
" Fortunately , this did not happen , " said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Interior .
The attackers abducted the five German , five Italian , one Romanian female , and eight of their Egyptian escorts on 19 September in southern Egypt .
Following the kidnapping in the desert area of South Egypt , the hostages were carried here and there in the border areas of Egypt , Libya , Sudan and Chad .
The identity of the hostage takers has remained unclear , as well as details of the release of hostages or possible ransom payments .
The survivors arrived safely in Cairo .
Steinmeier has informed us that the hostages freed are under the protection of the German embassy .
He did not comment on the details of release .
In Berlin , they have not yet provided any information on when they return to Germany .
According to the newspaper " Bild " , the five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on the Airbus plane of the German Air Force .
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package .
The lower house of the U.S. Congress , by a small majority , failed the $ 700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets .
Dow Jones fell into the deep .
The U.S. House of Representatives 227 did not vote 206 against a yes - rejected government life package for the financial markets .
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties , the program was not given a majority to stop the chaos that was in the financial markets .
The supporters were desperate to convince critics in a dramatic action of the need for a $ 700 billion package .
Barney Frank , a negotiator of the Democratic Party , called on the representatives to support the party , even though the plan is still unopportunate .
" It is difficult to gain political support to avoid something that has not yet happened " , he admitted .
Dow Jones fell more than 6 % or 600 points during the vote .
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail .
The index rose shortly before the vote was completed , so that it would fall again after the failure was made public .
Experts are counting further severe turbulences in international financial markets .
The programme shall be approved by both the Assembly and the Senate .
Directors register more and more reservations .
Good winter is promising for German tour operators .
According to a study , the turnover of the next months of travel reservations increased significantly compared to the previous year - more than 30 percent for the winter season .
Despite the weak economic outlook , the German travel spirit was not reduced according to the study .
In winter season bookings , travel agencies booked 31 percent turnover growth compared to the previous year - the German Travel Association ( DRV ) presented Monday in Berlin .
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute , the number of bookings for the autumn months is higher .
The October turnover of travel agencies exceeded October 2007 by 11 percent , DRV said .
These results are based on GfK data , which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates them to the entire market .
The Institute took into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008 .
Due to the weak exchange rate , especially the trips to the US are sought , DRV said .
Here the rate of reservations increased by one third .
The German especially popular destinations are Spain , Turkey and Greece , as well as the domestic landscapes .
Mostly the organized roads were sought , said Klaus Laepple , President of DRV .
Due to rising energy and food costs , the costs for organised roads can be " more calculated for passengers than for individualised trips . "
Passengers can save money with booking discounts , or all inclusive offers , added Laepple .
The booking rate of summer months was also very good , so compared to the previous year , traffic growth will be possible again - although another study shows that fewer German tourists have taken a trip compared to the previous year .
My first Oktoberfest
Repeated ballermann hits without breaks , lager beers and celebrities wearing dirndlit design .
Debug on Wiesn .
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not much alike .
He 's a blonde , TV host , and he wears a customized dirndl .
My hair is dark , I 'm a schoolgirl , and I bought my dress in the shower .
But one thing connects us : We 've been at Wiesnen for less than three minutes , photographers are already running and filling their memory cards - very flattering , and all this on my first visit to Wiesnen .
That 's how we make friends .
It seems that cheap dirndli is fulfilling its purpose .
The Wiesn - tourismist , who is a local in the north of the equator trained in white sausage , still sets a limit to my comfort .
But when you arrive at Theresienwies , it 's not so bad .
Almost everyone wears dirndlit or leather pants ; no one looks back or embarrassed - everything is absolutely fine .
Strange glances at the chocolate - stack are only the apron of my dirndli .
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I have broken the apron : " You are free to the left , you are a virgin in the middle , sold to the right , widow in the back . "
I secretly tied the bow from behind to the left .
" That 's good , " he says , and he laughs .
Others make fewer fuss around fine flirting techniques , and wear a simple felt hat " I 'm too drunk to dress up " with a sign and they 're showing off their naked butts .
The young man with exhibitionist features is called Bob , and also visited Oktoberfest for the first time .
What you find very fantastic , long - term stretching " aaaaa " .
He tells me all this after he 's disposed of the contents of his previously drank pint .
Right next to one of the fire hydrants , which everyone thinks is a garbage can .
Bob is one of the infamous " dirty urinators . "
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way .
At 8:00 p.m. , the ambulances are going to go through the scene in an army and take care of the poor couple .
Patient care always appear in a team - at the same time four people carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent .
This works like most Wiesn visitors : Arrival is empty , leaving is full .
Who lies in the alcohol coffin under the tarp does not show .
" These are the ones who are completely ready , " one of the medical staff cries to me about my question , and then the set .
The police have named the victim of the accident
The police named the 63-year - old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital .
The residents of Chelmsford Road , in Brentwood , were in an accident on Friday afternoon with Carole Paulson on Shenfield Road in the city .
He was taken to the hospital called Queen 's Hospital in romford , but later died .
After the accident , a 51-year - old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving .
He 's been released on bail ever since .
Degree of diplomatic horizon of Turkey
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union , European powers were burning with desire to penetrate deep into the Turkish Hinterland .
On the eastern side of Bosnia , perhaps only 20 steps from the European border , is one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial endeavor .
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a Neorena style .
At least that 's what the guidebooks say .
The building surrounds the end of the perons , one tower at each of the front corners , and it looks like some German country town hall .
The stone is dirty .
The whole building is a little bumpy .
However , looking at the interior of the vault ticket office , it is evident what large - scale enterprise this was the westernmost gate .
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia - Baghdad Corporation in August 1908 .
Germany , the " future of conquests " , through this Damascus , Baghdad , wanted to achieve its ambitions to capture the Middle East by the railway that is now leading to Saudi Arabia .
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railway lines were attacked by Lawrence and Arab partisans of Arabia .
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions , caused by frozen borders of the Cold War , disappeared .
The British colonial army left Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria .
Hyderpasha station did n't do any better .
In 1917 , a ammunition train exploded and destroyed the building 's nicely developed top .
Turkish sources say there 's been a sabotage operation .
Since then , history has been ruined and far beyond .
At the same time , today , as the gate of the railway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region , at least in a symbolic sense , serves as Turkey 's expanding diplomatic horizon .
The Party of Justice and Development on the government , AKP , has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country .
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions , caused by frozen borders of the Cold War , disappeared .
The new policy is the hallmark of commitment .
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria , with Hamas and Fatah ’s Palestinian groups , Iraq , Iran , and of course with the European Union and the United States .
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy , so I got on the night train to Ankara , Turkey , to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP , the Turkish Parliamentary Representative Suat Kiniklioglut .
The next morning , after about 10 and a half hours of squabbling , which at the time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world , " The Night Mail " , I arrived in the Turkish capital .
However , the AKP with known Islamic roots represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus .
This has caused some suspicion in the West , especially in Washington .
I took a taxi to AKP headquarters , an ultra - modern building made of stone and steel , specifically designed for this purpose - which is in a developing suburban district , half - finished shopping centers and coffee houses . In recent times , the suits mid - managers - both men and women - have been meeting in the morning to make a deal .
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right - right - right politician in any other European country .
He was wearing a suit , a tie , and I 'm sure he had a Blackberry .
" The party 's foreign policy aims to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment .
The Cold War has upset order , " he said .
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland .
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time .
He could n't choose between the two .
He had to open both ways .
" But is it possible that sooner or later you 're forced to choose ? " I asked .
" Turkey never wanted to get a response . "
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here , almost mechanically repeated : Turkey ’s relations with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea are equally beneficial to Europe and the United States as it is to Turkey itself .
It is as if they were to convey that , in a figurative sense , all of Europe , along with Turkey , could travel to Asia and the Middle East on those railway lines to the East .
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station , after another night , mostly awake , I thought Herr Ritter and Herr Conura , the two German gentlemen who watched this fancy building recover 100 years ago .
How they would have wondered if they knew that Europe ’s ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey ’s hands .
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back through the Bosphorus , I remembered that Turkey was called " a sick man of Europe " .
At the time , there was no question of which continent would claim this exciting country .
Remembering life paths : Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote : since 1962 , as the music director of Guildford , Vernon " Tod " Handley (nekrológ , Sep 11 ) led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir .
Based on the musical plans for the city , he founded his wonderful youth choir , Proteus the following year .
They were supposed to be only 21 years old , but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were at the end of our 20s - we were simply not willing to part with the choir .
The name " Proteus " ( the name of the mythological shape - changing ) was consistent with the determination and ability of the choir to cope with any music that they put before him - whether it be the madrigal or a Messiaen piece ; without an escort or a largezenekari escort .
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazingly and always exciting , and we could thank the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years .
How often Tod told us , " let the music speak itself . "
He always said , " The composer knows what he wants .
Everything 's in the sheet music .
So sing it ! "
Hisarmacist technique was always completely understandable and accurate , but never dictatorial or exaggerating .
Whatever the standard of music was , he always raised it .
John Frayn Turner wrote :
If there was ever a conductor who should have been knighted , Vernon Handley .
I was well acquainted with the two decades during which , from 1962 to 1982 , the Guildford Philharmonic was conducted .
In the last 40s , I 've written criticism of over 100 concerts , but it never let me down with one , and it 's often inspired me .
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty , which is very rare .
He hated the wrists who , in his words , simply " danced with a few well - known bums all over the world . "
Many of us will miss him .
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes :
According to your obituary William Woodruff ( 25 September ) , " he continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1946 , and in 1950 he became a scholarship to Houblon - Norman research institute ... while continuously preparing for his bachelor 's degree , master 's degree and PhD title . "
This is from the authors ' notes of Woodruff 's " Beyond Nab End " , but it 's wrong .
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economics at Nottingham University , and under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry , which was then published in 1958 under the title " The British Rubber Industry " .
In 1950 - 51 he was indeed in the USA with a Houblon - Norman scholarship , and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois , New York and Harvard .
In 1953 , he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois .
You never know why Woodruff was making this period of his career better .
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Humanities
I recommend the exhibition " J. Vicente Resino " Flamenco and élet̵ " because its black and white , documentary - style photos are impressive .
The simplicity and strength of them , as well as respect for the people in the photographs , have attracted my attention .
This exhibition is being moved by emotions .
Resino knows how to capture magical moments . "
Secondly , sales record at Honda
In November Honda will begin the second generation Jazz distribution .
True , even his predecessor had a large enough utaster , but the design of the interior of the new model was even more spacious .
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings .
Evolution versus revolutions .
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like .
Although the new Jazz is very similar to its predecessor , many internal changes have been made .
These include , for example , innovative design , new bodywork , larger sizes and new mechanics .
But before we move to a detailed description of the new model , we must say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the launch of the first generation .
So , first of all , we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers .
Although Jazz is less known in Europe , it is also a record selling in other markets .
For example , Japan , where Jazz was the most wanted car brand in 2002 and this year in 2008 .
In Japan , for example , nearly a million copies of Jazz have been sold since the release of the market .
The second market was the Old Continent , with nearly half a million copies sold in six years .
Nevertheless Honda wants to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz .
That is , while in 2007 , the Japanese company sold 83,000 Jazz , by 2009 , estimates will set the goal of selling 100,000 cars , which would result in a 17 % increase in the European market .
Since 2002 , Honda has sold 8000 Jazz , which accounts for 6.7 % of Honda 's total sales in Spain .
For the new generation , the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary calculate 2000 examples sold over a year .
In fact , the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly relieve the decline in Honda ’s traffic in Spain .
The company ’s representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year , which means 4000 less than 2007 data , i.e. 16 % decrease .
Despite the sales conditions , Honda increased its market share in Spain , which increased by 1.6 % last year to 1.8 % .
By 2010 , I would like to increase this rate to 2 % .
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model .
This would be the Insight , a five - door and compact - 4370 mm long hybrid , from which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units worldwide every year .
According to the Japanese manufacturer , 50 % of Insight 's market distribution would be made by the United States , while the remaining share would be shared between the Old Continent and Japan .
The commercial introduction of Insight after the official Valencian presentation planned for January is due in the first months of the year .
Compared to the first generation , the new Jazz became more spacious in every aspect .
The length reaches 3900 mm ( five inches longer ) with a width of hosszabb mm ( two inches wider ) and a shaft distance increased by five centimeters , i.e. 2500 mm .
The height of the car is still 1520 mm .
In addition to the dimensions , the cabin was also more spacious .
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new body , on the other hand the fuel tank in the middle - this solution can be known from the previous Jazz .
Furthermore , the entire cargo holder - called double floor - has increased , currently 399 litres , that is 19 liters above the capacity of the first generation .
Although it is part of the fact that these sizes refer to the type with the 1.4 engine , the trunk of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres .
Some external modifications can be discovered , for example , the rear led lamps or optional panoramic glass roof , as well as the easier accessibility of the rear seats .
In addition , the opening angle of the back seats was raised to 80 degrees , compared to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees .
The second generation Jazz engines are new .
At the beginning of its distribution , this small model can be ordered with two , 1.2 and 1.4 litres of drive .
Thanks to i - VTEC technology , both resources are more favourable than previous models , as well as less carbon dioxide emissions and excellent mechanical coordination , while the engine offers outstanding performance in every respect .
The power of 1.2 litre resource is 90 horsepower at 6000 speeds , and its maximum torque is 114 Nm 4900 .
This engine , which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz , consumes 5.3 liters and is 125 grams of CO2 emissions .
The other engine , which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation , now reaches 100 horsepower .
The 100 hp Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres , and its emissions are 128 grams CO2 .
The " beehu " avoiding the collision
To develop accident prevention technologies , Nissan has inspired the world of bees to create new ideas .
The Japanese company designed a robot that mimics bees flyers to avoid accidents .
The Bio -etic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step towards developing impact prevention technologies .
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co. ’s Advanced Technical Center in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the University of Tokyo , built this small robot in Japan .
Kazuhhiro Doi , Director of Technology PR and Research Development , defines that BR23C is an additional extension of Nissan 's four - level safety barrier .
The robot will improve the impact evasion capacity of the company 's products .
During the flight , each bee creates its oval - shaped personal space , which is very similar to the Nissan safety barrier .
However , the role of the complex eye of the uterus is much more important , with which it sees in every direction at a angle of more than 300 degrees .
To copy the function of the complex eye , engineers designed a so - called laser distance meter (aser Range Finder ) .
The instrument identifies obstacles within a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C , calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor , which immediately transforms into a action to avoid impact .
" As soon as the obstacle is detected , the small robot immediately changes direction by imitation of the movements of the uterus by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision .
The system is mostly distinguished from the instruments currently available , that in this case the evasive maneuver is carried out completely automatically .
If not , the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles , ” explains Andoh Toshiyuki , Director of the Mobility Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project .
In a different way from bees , the maneuver can not be directed up or downwards , and can not move diagonally , only in two dimensions and only towards the reversibility of wheels , that is , not in infinite directions and ways , as it happens in bees .
That is why Nissan used a rotational function to avoid collisions in the robot , besides acceleration and slowdown .
" This structure only has to process data every few seconds and respond to them .
There is no need to store data or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres , so it can operate without interruption with just a few dozen KB memories .
This may sound surprising , but it 's not gigabyte , but we do n't even talk about megabyte - sized memories .
This is the first step towards developing the technology for instant collision prevention , which , according to Nissan estimates , can enter production cars within ten years .
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries , which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion version .
In the future , the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional option to get the car driver to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road .
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the Treasury Department of the United States has a lot of cash to invest in , without reason .
Because the crisis is on their necks , and so that Americans do not get involved in mortgage banks with questionable solvency , they created a fun and informative online game called " Bad Credit Hotel " .
This is the " Bad Loans Hotel " ... or the Trouble .
The miserable face of the accommodation and especially the receptionist suggests that we should consider once again , twice , or even , more than three times , is the time to take the loan really just now .
And especially where to apply for a loan , because that 's probably the purpose of it .
The information on this website is indeed useful , but little detailed .
It 's more for teenagers than for the public .
But what would happen if we added the game ?
For example , the hotel would show up the room of our dreams .
It 's actually something , since we do n't even dare to dream about buying a house .
Morgan Stanley opens its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it would provide a share in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( MUFG ) . The largest Japanese bank would pay $ 9 billion for 21 % of the company ’s capital after Morgan Stanley stock price fell heavily on the stock exchange .
A week after the preliminary agreement was published , the two banks said that the MUFG would buy 9.9 % of Morgan Stanley 's stock at a $ 25.25 unit price , i.e. a total of $ 3 billion .
The accepted price is more than 19 % off the value of securities by the book of 31 August .
The MUFG invests another $ 6 billion in transferable securities , which provide 10 % yields , and their exchange rate is $ 31.25 .
According to Morgan Stanley , the global transaction is based on a $ 29 average rate , 28 % higher than the current exchange rate .
However , Morgan Stanley 's stock price dropped around 6.79 % in greenwich mid - term , and thus closed at $ 23.07 .
" This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate his transformation into a bankholding company , " explains John Mack , CEO of the American group .
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week , which allows you to diversify your activities , but is under the control of the Federal Reserve .
Agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the corporate giants listed on Wall Street .
By the conditions announced on Monday , it is clear that the agreement has been modified in recent days : last Monday Morgan announced that it would sell 20 % of its shares to Japanese companies for about $ 8.5 billion .
" A week ago we thought that the share would be entirely composed of stock shares , " explained Toshihide Mizuno , Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo .
" But because of the current market and economic situation , we wanted to minimize and prevent possible risks . "
MUFG pays 7 % more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares in terms of weighted average price .
As a result of the transaction , the yield per share is reduced by approximately 20 % .
On the basis of the agreement , MUFG may switch half of its priority shares into core shares after one year , if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50 % over a specified period , i.e. it will rise to about 47 dollars .
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that you can use funds from MUFG to leverage your investment opportunities , improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources .
However , the spokesperson of the group is not interested in providing accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies .
Following MUFG ’s partnership , Morgan Stanley is expected to increase Tier I ’s solvency rate by about 15 % , making it one of the best in its own sector .
Morgan has stated that its balance " definitely " has improved since the end of August .
The last few weeks have been a great challenge for the group , as the stock price has fallen to half , while the cost of ensuring non - payment risk has gone sky - high .
This cost decreased on Monday , but remained at a high level of around 12 % .
One of the big investor banks left behind the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch . This Goldman Sachs , which announced last week that it had reached $ 15 billion : part of this came from Berkshire Hathaway , Warren Buffett 's group .
Rafael Correa Monday statement , Quito
The re - establishment of the republic in the spirit of the 21st century socialism .
This is the common plan of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez , Bolivian Evo Morales and Rafael Correa of Ecuador .
Following the model of his fellow presidents and friends , Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday .
He succeeded in his mission , as 64 % of voters voted yes in the referendum according to official results , which concern 80 % of the votes .
According to this , 28 % of the population voted no , 7 % of the votes were invalid , while 0.7 % were released unloaded .
The draft Constitution needed 50 % + 1 vote .
On Sunday , two surveys at the exit of the voting offices and counting by a NGO proved the vast superiority of the votes " yes " by 63 % or 70 % .
Rafael Correa , by the way , spoke about the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday - Monday nights .
" The Constitution was a sweeping victory " , he said , and thanked the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governor in Guayaquil , 280 kilometres southwest of Quito .
As is known , Rafael Correa , Chávez , Morales and Chilean president Michelle Bachelet congratulated .
According to the United States Observatory 's mission , the vote was in a calm atmosphere . The main theme was a 444-point text , which summarized the principles of " new socialism " protected by the President .
The proposed Constitution sets the state power to serve the economy , maintaining the right to " plan development " for a country that basically lives from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by migrants .
The draft Constitution of Correa , elected in 2006 , also confirms the power of the head of state , who can obtain a mandate for a period of up to two consecutive years and is entitled to dissolution of the Parliament .
Correa has announced that she would like to take this opportunity and re - compete for the head of state in February 2009 .
The President has already started to introduce this in his country , with a population of 13.9 million , and half of the population lives under the minimum of existence .
Finally , the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country . This may end Quito and Washington 's agreement on the use of the ecuadori facility as a base for U.S. drug measures .
They freed 19 hostages in Chad
Egyptian commando hit the kidnappers who took 11 tourists and eight of their escorts hostage ten days ago .
The hostages are now in Cairo .
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days , from which they were transported unharmed Monday afternoon to the Egyptian capital .
The hostages were released in Chad during the morning by an Egyptian commando .
Apparently , they arrived at the Al -aza military base at about 4:30 p.m. directly connected to Cairo International Airport .
The hostages were forbidden to comment to the press and immediately transported to a hospital in the suburban residential district of Maadi , Cairo , where they were examined .
The hostages are " healthy " and the kidnappers " did not pay ransom " , said Egyptian Tourist Minister Zoheir Garanna at the airport .
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in Egypt , Sudan and Libya , where they participated in a SUV safari .
The group had 11 tourists ( five Italian men , five German men and one Romanian woman ) , eight Egyptian : two tour guides , four drivers , a border guardian and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency organising safari .
An Egyptian security officer reported that a 30-member special commando arrived on two helicopters , where they raided the hostages just before dawn .
" The troops were involved in a firefight . Half of the kidnappers were killed , the others fled , " said the leader asking for his silence .
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Squad to Sudan , where they were added to the German and Italian commandos .
The Italian diplomatic leader , Franco Frattini , who was in Belgrade , stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups .
“ We must admit that this result could not have been achieved without professional and effective intervention of our secret service personnel and action groups , ” he said , without further details .
He also denied the ransom for the hostages .
The previous day , the Sudanese Army announced that a SUV was arrested while patrolling , where the kidnappers traveled , killing six of them ( including the leader of Chad ) and arresting two of them .
The Army claimed that the hostages were connected to a rebel organization in Darfur , the Sudan Liberation Movement ( SLA - U ) , which was immediately disproved by the organization concerned .
Lettres - The Quiet majority of Culture
The focus of the news and the election campaign currently stands on the debate on the financing of culture .
We can only be happy about that .
But they will still forget a piece of our cultural lives .
Who will raise their word to highlight the ridiculous amounts of small museums on the verge of starvation , archives , archaeological excavations and national historical monuments?[1 ]
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage ?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that truly ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage ?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley ?
And the Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture , and that this inheritance must be protected by all citizens , all elected representatives and all government bodies in concert .
Within the framework of the Quebec Historical Society ( Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Quebec ) , 211 companies engaged in history , cultural heritage , archives and genealogical research are working on the research of history , as well as the preservation of large number of private archives and archaeological artifacts with a minimum budget .
Often these organizations protect our heritage with tooth and nail , and protest with the last power of the drowning , when real estate developers and decision makers guide their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten graveyards .
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage ?
Benelux governments will start part of the Fortis bank
With a partial nationality , Benelux states help the first European bank in trouble because of the disruption of the US credit market crisis , Fortison : the three countries support the Hungarian financial and insurance institute with a total of € 11.2 billion .
The Belgian , Luxembourg and the Netherlands government agreed on the case at the highest level at the end of the week , involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission ’s competitiveness officer .
In the euro area , Fortis bank has the first major crisis in the international financial market crisis that has been ringing in waves for over a year , and decisions on the bank can therefore be considered precedent in some respects .
According to the decision made on Sunday night , nearly half ( 49 percent ) of all three states acquire the bank ’s existing property there .
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests , including , above all , the activities purchased from ABN Amro in the Netherlands last year - mainly insurance .
Fortis ' shares began to fall steeply last week , and in the second half of the week there were serious crisis phenomena at the institute .
However , analysts agree that with 85,000 employees , the bank is too large to let go of bankruptcy .
The company 's papers fell only 12 percent on Friday , 14 years of low .
Since January , the stock value has decreased by more than two thirds .
The total market capital value of the group is around € 14 billion in current stock prices , but according to the corporate managers , this is not realistic .
The management also blamed overseas market uncertainties on the adoption of the $ 700 billion US package plan for the fall of Fortis shares .
On Monday , the papers were slightly up .
On Friday , Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank .
The financial institution also sought private buyers , but no one has ever applied with a substantial offer .
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry , they do not lose their money .
The bank ’s clients have not been panicked , the accounts have not been stormed .
Fortis has an independent account in Hungary and has also acquired leasing companies .
Fox in the henhouse
In America , life and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude an insurance contract with the applicant based on the data of the people buying medicines .
Data protection professionals are afraid that the market for data is becoming uncontrollable .
" There is a data protection program that links the use of the data on the prescription of medicines to the consent of the person concerned .
This should be in independent hands , otherwise we leave the henhouse to the fox , ” says Richard Dick , developer of the program for following prescriptions of medicine at the Washington Post .
The insurance companies make the insurance fee and the amount of damage related to the health of the applicant dependent on the risk , and if they consider the risk too large , they do not even make insurance with it .
They used to send the person for medical examination and concluded the contract only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation .
Dick has invented a much cheaper procedure for ten years : based on the customer ’s identification number , he easily acquires what medicines he has purchased in the past year and a half , and this program itself implies what disease he suffers from and what his health condition is .
For example , if you regularly buy a high dose of cholesterol reductions , it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually unmanageable , which immediately classifies you as a higher risk .
Several versions of the programme are also available , some of which also determine a risk multiplier number , so the insurance company has little to do outside of the paperwork , although small difficulties arise .
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for several purposes , for example , some compounds can be used against migraines or heat waves , but they are also effective against depression .
The latter is considered a significant risk - enhancing factor for business insurance companies , not the former ones .
They have developed separate companies to request and process the data , and they , before they obtain the necessary information from the pharmacies , ask the patient for their consent .
They are now bound by the authorities , although they have not been punished for their failure .
Some companies are now processing the results of laboratory tests and are also linked to drug consumption data , so they can provide a more accurate picture of patient health .
More and more companies have access to data , and the control of use is becoming increasingly difficult .
There is a special health data protection law , but it only covers healthcare providers and insurance companies .
Before Congress , there is a bill that gives authorities control over companies specializing in data provision .
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough : therefore he has developed his program that would link the transfer of data to the explicit consent of the data subject .
Another question is that the data subject can not very deny the consent , otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him .
So the hens are , in some ways , dependent on the goodwill of the fox .
Global Marseille menu
Double trade in the European Union and India
As the European Union and India mutually co - trading partners , this topic also dominated the agenda of the ninth summit , with the rest , mostly global problems .
Today , there will be a French - Indian summit , where we will focus mainly on nuclear energy cooperation .
Although the European Union recognises that India is an ascending democratic power that should give greater influence to international affairs , but the member states have not yet reached common ground , to support New Delhi ’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council .
This question was not even pushed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , as the President of the Union , and President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana , received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who agreed to double the trade in five years , which means that they will increase trade turnover to hundreds of billions of euros .
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007 , this is not an ambitious goal .
In this spirit , the twenty - six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally reconciled , i.e. air traffic could soar in the future .
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009 .
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiation .
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India ’s number one trading partner , New Delhi is only ranked ninth in the EU ’s partners .
The summit has devoted its attention to global affairs .
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan , as well as terrorism , was condemned in all forms of both sides and called for the UN Conference to be convened .
They also called for the end of the Doha trade round , although both of them have a large part of the failure .
The EU has confirmed that it will persist in its energy and climate programme , i.e. it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 .
India agreed with this , as well as the need to make a global deal at the Climate Conference due next year , and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050 .
I also want to prevent the rise in food prices and support the convening of an international meeting to review the financial crisis .
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today , where he is preparing to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting .
In Paris , they hope that the French companies will be assigned to build nuclear reactors in India worth 20 billion euros .
Information from the news agency says the agreement would be for 15 years .
More than 300 Italian publishing houses in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair .
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the 60th Buchmesse Fair , the most significant international copyright meeting .
This year 's International Book Fair in Frankfurt is expected to have 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries , in the base area of 171,790 square meters , where more than 403,000 books will be presented .
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion , the Italian government is represented by Francesco Mariaejt , Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Jovels and Activities : Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters , by setting up a unified Italia Point .
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the " Room Struktur " room of Buchmesse 5.0 , where there is also an opportunity to explain the situation of Italian publishing , trends and prospects .
According to data , the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly reduced , especially in adult and youth publications .
They found the one - year - old billionaire , Steve Fossett 's plane .
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett 's plane , who disappeared on September 3 , 2007 , over the Nevada desert .
The wreckage was discovered on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border between California and Nevada .
No human remains were found inside the aircraft .
John Anderson , Sheriff of Madera County , dispelled all the remaining doubts : " After determining the position of the plane , we sent a team , and now we can be sure that this is about the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared , " he said at a press conference .
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or the surrounding area .
The 63-year - old billionaire was declared dead in February .
The U.S. Department of Transport Security ( NTSB ) reported that a few hours after the discovery of the wreckage , a committee of investigations was asked to identify the aircraft and to determine that it was indeed about the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3 , 2007 , the day Fossett left the Nevada Yerington on a three - hour flight .
Yesterday , in California , near the Nevada border , a couple found some of Fossett 's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes .
Two I.D.s for Fosset , issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration , some cash and a sweater .
Fossett 's search was filed a month after he disappeared .
The billionaire has set up several peaks that have made him enter history .
In 2002 , for the sixth time , he managed to fly around the world with an air balloon : two weeks of lonely flight .
Three years later , he went around the ground by plane , without landing .
He has several records of flying over the Andes , at 15,445 metres , which he performed with a copilot .
GLK , staggering advertising
An unusual , yet original and definite hobby - propelled hobby with large surfaces and clear corners .
In a few words , this is the latest Mercedes - Benz compact SUV , with which the German automobile company tried to bring fresh momentum to the market .
This is why the introduction campaign of SUV GLK in Mercedes - Benz showrooms will be surprising and unusual as a result of the content different from the traditional one .
The ad campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle is a media communication tool that has been unknown to date , including through utopian 3D posters that have not been used in Italy .
The billboard action , consisting of three stages , will rule the central shopping street of Milan , Corso Como until 15 November .
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the space - effect presentation of the car , in which the new SUV , with the help of special glasses distributed around Corso Como , will be visible in almost real sizes and in three - dimensional form .
The image viewer will feel like the car is coming out of the poster .
After that , with innovative Elumina8 technology , every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one , so that it can form a unified image .
With this promotion , Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry .
Can this get the attention of prospective customers ?
We 'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are
They 're young people from Triveneto , probably locked out of the field .
But who is this 150 - 200 boys and girls that are now ashamed of the whole of Italy?The members of the group " Ultras Italia " , which has been following the team for years , and which , in fact , has not caused too much trouble .
They never hit on the opponents .
The core of the group is right .
The main organizers are from Trivento .
And Verona , Padua , Trieste and Udin .
These were joined by smaller sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia ( actually only a few units ) .
They were waving Italian flags , which were marked by the parents ' hometown : on Saturday they were removed to avoid identification .
They follow the example of English fans .
In Bulgaria , they faced a real Nazi fan team called the Levski Drucers .
The Italian Football Association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans , which were tickets to the name , making it easier to check the fan team .
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone : among those preparing for Sofia there was no action against whom no one was allowed to visit the stadium .
Four Italian fans with a record of football denied tickets and travel .
At present , the Ministry of Interior is waiting for minutes from the Sofia police station , and then it takes the necessary measures : fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots can be banned for five years .
It is an international ban , which applies not only to the visit to the Italian but also to all stadiums in Europe .
So our football hooligans ca n't get their feet on any football field .
Luckily .
But we also have to worry that the hooligans find followers , that is , that the only one hundred and fifty people are joined by others .
" We must immediately strangle this fire , we must not apologize to the one who behaves this way , " the Ministry of Interior said .
So it 's better to keep our eyes open , especially since Wednesday 's national match day is coming up in Lecce .
In Puglia there is a smaller cell supporting Italian ultrasounds .
Tomorrow , the Observatory Service will be meeting , and Tuesday , the Committee on Sports Events Analysis , which can count on a department of Homeland Security , the secret services dealing with cheerleading behaviour .
" Duce - Duce 's skandering and swinging arm during the Italian anthem?In Bulgaria , it 's not a crime . "
He expressed this idea , in a rather unfortunate way , Domenico Mazzilli , who was appointed a few weeks ago to lead the observation service of the Ministry of Interior ( Francesco Tagliente , and Felice Ferlizzi , before ) .
Before that , Mazzilli was the head of Trieste , the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002 .
What Mazzilli says is true is not forbidden to live Duce in Bulgaria , but the behavior of 150 - 200 fans was shameful .
I 'm not a sociologist , he added the first person in the surveillance service , but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime was committed .
Until now , this group has not caused any problems , we need to consider exactly what happened and consider how to proceed .
But let 's talk a little bit about the whistling of the Italian anthem : it 's not a crime , but if I may say so , it 's not a good thing to call it a good education . "
