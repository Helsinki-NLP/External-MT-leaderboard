Food inflation in Europe has spiked
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the steady rise in food prices.
The November price growth in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1% in October, after 2.6%, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate, as the reduction would, together with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below 2%, but close to that.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "deter" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent was a 15-year high; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has been pushed upwards by soaring food and energy prices.
The price of wheat has risen 88 percent, and the price of soybeans has reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay substantially more for edible oil and dairy products.
Oil prices on world markets have risen 52 percent this year, and last month, a barrel of black gold was already worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% in 2008 to 2.5% in 2009, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain at around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but its annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a protracted stagnation in early December, Fidesz's support has grown significantly, to its largest since 2002, while the Gallup Institute has never before targeted the Socialists with such a low support of 13%.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference would be more than two-thirds (71%) support compared to a five-fifth support for SMEs, due to the greater commitment of the opposition voters.
The MDF and SZDS are under the threshold for parliamentary membership, according to the poll: their support among the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, there is a one percent increase in supporters of both camps.
Public opinion of the economy has deteriorated from the previous low - the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be extremely bad has never been higher - 41 percent, while another 46 percent say the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after the more optimistic spring and summer outlook.
As for the next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth of the population to improve.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, the most of any Gallup poll to date, thought the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsany is believed or very believed by 13 percent of those polled, while Viktor Orbán has a 38 percent share of supporters.
The Prime Minister is not trusted by 54 percent, the leader of Fidesz by 27 percent.
One indicator of the political situation is how much the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While after last October's unrest, 35 percent of the government and prime ministers considered the government and the prime minister to be desirable, this figure is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in calling new elections.
Interest in the referendum is marked by the fact that 60 percent of those questioned said that a referendum would definitely take place and another 20 percent said it was likely.
By comparison, only 55% of those who voted in the "parliamentary elections on Sunday" would be certain to vote, while another 15% would consider their participation likely.
The school would say no, 74, doctor's fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same percentages just in the circle of people who are sure to attend, then the introduction of tuition, doctor's fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth over Tesco.
The hypermarkets in the Budapest shopping triangle maintained their average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
The article in the daily newspaper Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas shopping basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság in the Budapest shopping triangle has risen by an average of 16 percent this year, but all hypermarkets have seen a price increase of well over a thousand forints.
Since food supermarket prices soared in December last year, the percentage increase was not so drastic from the previous high base.
But it is certainly unpleasant for consumers that what they could have bought for under 9,000 forints last year, they will not now be able to buy for even 10,000.
The daily economy's shopping cart in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of 10 000 forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 the cost of a shopping cart was 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the price of raw breast, nuts and poppy also rose sharply.
The prices of bread and flour were in line with the figures of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchán we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Also surprising in this store was that the price of a two-liter Coke in a recycled bottle was under 200 forints, so even with the advance, the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the daily Napi Gazdaság Auchan, it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in the shopping cart of the daily Napi Gazdaság have increased compared to last year's Christmas prices by 15%, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by approximately 18%.
Comparing last year's high and this year's low, the difference in the basket was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's low and this year's high is 21 percent.
The average increase in forints was 1,480.
The average price increase last year was 1 206 forints, with prices last Christmas affected by the VAT increase.
This process was distorted by the trade, as the shops were clearly unable to decide how large the price ranges to set for individual products were, as they could not predict the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the product in question incorrectly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of the circulation.)
Last year, the rise in the price of the daily newspaper Napi Gazdaság's consumer basket was so extreme because of VAT that the price of the most expensive basket was HUF 1,720 higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest was HUF 844.
This year, the difference has not been dramatic, with the most expensive basket now costing 1,630 forints more than last year and the cheapest basket at 1,284 forints.
Comparing the two seasons, the price increases were catastrophic, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This is not entirely confirmed by the figures of the Central Statistical Office: it has recorded price increases of more than 30% over 12 months for several basic foodstuffs.
Except for flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, this seems almost impossible according to the Daily Economy Consumer Basket, since the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, showed, in the worst case scenario, a price increase of hardly more than 10 per cent, given the basis.
Flour suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and have managed to enforce drastic price increases in international chains.
The hypermarkets in the shopping golden triangle don't complain, they still report a good year.
In our experience, most of the customers in the three stores we visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything by the quota, take the lasting food on their wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets were in long lines at the checkout as the number of visitors increased sharply.
But as we know, the turnover in the countryside is lower, and many international chains complain to research firms that their sales are falling behind their plans, not only for food but also for durable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being saved
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were reported in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff in the disease control system are not helping, says the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, there is also a saving in disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who was hospitalized after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier this year.
The patient who was seriously injured in a car accident was released home, but soon afterward he had to return with an MRSA infection, and because of the bacteria in his body, one major operation was still not possible.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, director of the National Epidemiological Centre.
That means that so many MDR infections have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, the rest are unknown.
Almost two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one third of the human population through the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e. g. strep throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and are well treated.
However, if antibiotics are given in excess or inappropriately, the bacteria that respond well to the antibiotic will develop into bacteria that are highly resistant to the antibiotics and that spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, in patients with weakened immune systems, low body weight or in elderly patients, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as morning sickness or sepsis, if the immune system is temporarily or permanently dysfunctional.
According to the chief medical officer of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing unusual about MRSA infection, and similar infections are commonplace in hospitals.
"Infection should not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is not confined to those areas", stated Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated".
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the healthcare staff treats them in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the antibiotics we need to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are first tested for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions in home hospitals are not conducive to preventing the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is predominantly found in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
Microbiological sampling in Hungarian hospitals is not the fashion.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund this study is also a factor.
Most cases are detected if the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, pathologies.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotic therapy, or to conduct microbiological testing to prevent the development of drug resistance, but hospitals do not always follow this.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in primary and outpatient treatment, said Karolina Böröcz.
Saving on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly spread among patients through healthcare professionals.
Hence, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but these are also seriously lacking in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and by touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in home hospitals.
In contrast, rooms are often crowded, and beds are often very close together, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be kept at least 1.5 metres apart.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, unfortunately, we may also see hospitals in poor financial conditions cutting back on disinfectants, with few nurses and many patients, increasing the chances of infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are observed, there is a demonstrable decrease in such infections or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it's being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has put in place a programme to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its incidence.
The programme seems to be a success, with the release of data showing that MRSA infections in England are on a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) places the prevention of the emergence of multiresistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens as one of its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official expert opinion on the case of the police captain of the XXII district who caused the fatal accident is complete.
It is impossible that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed the pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs, the spokesman of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of the capital Attila Morvai informed on Friday after the expert assessment of the case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the results of the preliminary investigation, which had already found that the former police captain had not drunk any alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then-Director of the Police Department of the XXII District hit his car on Lajose Kossuth Street in the XXII District on Tuesday while turning a curve, a 55-year-old man who crossed him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter mentioned fact that a pedestrian crossed outside the zebra, otherwise according to the rules of the road traffic is not a mitigating circumstance, the detouring car must still give priority.)
The walker died after being transported to the hospital.
Because of these events, the district police chief resigned and requested to be retired, according to police reports, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million in 2006 for the budgetary financing of transport and environment projects implemented with the support of the Cohesion Fund in Hungary, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement for EUR 100 million, the contract now signed covering the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which will be used mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of a fourth metro line.
The parties agreed that once Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to the question of whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary, totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-month grace period and without a commitment fee is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the formerly somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying into the EU's ever-cheapest but fastest-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after destination for Eastern European property purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski resorts and seaside homes.
The mountains are the most in the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha area, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later investors will also be interested in the central part of the country - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will also be interested in shopping around the cheapest city in Russia.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space offering the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe, becoming a popular destination for the next two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
Analysts say that property buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
The majority of customers come from England, but there are also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and the Black Sea and skiing paradises traditionally have many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication, and are keen to be close to a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is the chat shoppers (Bulgaria was among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of increasing value in the medium or long term.
The capital's real estate auctions are ongoing as demand grows stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but over the past five years, real estate prices have increased by 21 percent annually.
The increase in real estate prices is far outpacing the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to Minister of Environment and Water Gabor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and the international conference on the post-2012 climate regime will continue with ministerial talks after the official opening on Wednesday.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are negotiating the Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts following the Kyoto Protocol's emissions reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to discuss exact figures at this time, although it is committed to an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels.
Another big question at the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, the developed countries will also agree to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that depend on them.
The agreement also included subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set up by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member steering board, most likely under the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), according to Piace es Profit.
Hungarian six percent
Minister for Environment and Water Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to remain a leader in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the 'post-2012 agreement', and is ready to commit to up to 30% reductions if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to take responsibility and commitments commensurate with their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set a reduction target of 5.2%, with the 15 EU Member States committing to 8%.
Hungary has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared with 1985-87, which Hungary will do.
Bali is a big country, because an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, or its entry into force would be delayed until 2012, in which case it would not immediately implement the reduction commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, a new emission reduction system that the UN's International Panel on Climate Change, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, also pointed out in its latest report.
This would delay emissions reductions and inevitably raise the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, with extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military forces are posting video footage of their actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing site to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) first became a fan of YouTube, with special forces operating in Afghanistan uploading videos of operations against the Taliban there since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The footage, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, is controlled by the Air Force Headquarters, which is in charge of combat operations in the Kandahar area, and then sent on to London, where it is transmitted over the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have been made available on the Internet and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered as Defence Headquarters in the spring of 2007 and publishes footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Force in Iraq (IPTF) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force released the videos as originally intended for recruitment purposes, and according to the Department of Defense, they are also good for informing the general public about the true purpose of the military's presence abroad.
"Propaganda in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads", said BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it necessarily carries a political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government".
The Americans have made a game
The army is concerned that amateur videos, including those of soldiers who die, are being uploaded alongside carefully edited, censored videos: in a bit of a hypocritical, "official" propaganda film, officers talk about casualties at best, but there is no bloody combat.
There are many videos on the Internet of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were made during the intense deployment, but the British Army has only now discovered them.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently - with a free-to-download shooter called America's Army, in which the player can get right into the soldiers' skin through a more or less faithful simulation.
There 'll be Christmas at the Ministries with the curls and the bagpipes
Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she organises a final working meeting for her colleagues, where she bids farewell to 2007 with a cup of coffee and a cup of tea.
In some ministries, there will be a celebration with live music, in others, they will bring the Christmas atmosphere to the officials with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how the powerful have fun.
The government is preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas party this year is being hosted by the Ministry of Defence, but it's not expected to be staffed by the Ministry.
On Christmas, the orphans give gifts to the children of fallen soldiers, on Mission Christmas they host the family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they also host a reception for journalists.
The resort is spending $25 million on the atmosphere by the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are outperforming the other departments.
The GKM party is being held in the center of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and from the six hundred employees of the Ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will celebrate its Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas party cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the building of the State Council of Justice (OIT) - the program included concerts and dinners.
The hall cost one million forints to rent, the rest was spent on over four hundred guests.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: the tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG), is hosting it with EU funds.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház theatre.
MAG a.s. did not confirm this information as we were unable to contact the person concerned.
No need for a suit.
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas held a St. Lucia ball on December 7.
But the ILO did not want money from him for the use of its halls.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with a toast to the minister, and after dinner, dancing was possible to the accompaniment of live music.
According to the portal's [origo] response, evening dress or costume were not mandatory at all.
The Puritan party is being organized by the Departments of Health, Labor and Local Government.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a 400,000-forint program and celebration for employees in its own building.
Labor Secretary Monica Lamperth even officially invites her coworkers to a Christmas party, but to a final work meeting.
There are 180 guests, who according to the press release will only receive coffee and pasta, so the party will only be 350,000 forints.
Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the lobby of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas meeting, which is expected to bring 436 employees, in its own large hall.
He donates 2,500 forints per guest for the Christmas party - the total includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since János Veres became minister, the PM's staff celebrates Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party will be lacking, however, with the formality intensified not only by the ministerial address but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Department is holding a New Year's reception on January 20th, the ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the City Gardens and, according to the Ministry's announcement, there will be 1,000 forints per person for 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting from the minister and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not hosting any Christmas parties, the relevant press service told [origo].
The price of the environmental department's Christmas party in the press department was not announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Arts and Industry.
He 's about to go on a massive strike .
The League of Trade Unions and the National Union of Workers' Councils will form their strike commission on Friday to coordinate the Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday there will be a protest public meeting, and on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance bill - work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause serious disruption to traffic, as rail traffic will almost completely stop and the employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association and the National Union of Trade Unions will announce the details of the strike they're planning for Monday.
There will also be a strike committee of the League of Nations, which will coordinate the action on Monday.
A protest public meeting is held on Saturday, and from Monday, the unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
That means there is no set deadline for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally pass the health insurance bill, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
If the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next step.
According to the Monday agenda, the health insurance bill may not be voted on until late in the evening or even at night.
The strike, which begins on Monday, will cause serious disruptions to traffic: work on the railway will be halted indefinitely, part of Budapest's public transport may be halted in the morning, and more than half of Volán's companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half the runway will be closed.
The call for strike action was joined by numerous trade unions and civil society organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced an indefinite strike, others announced a temporary halt to work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (HNS) and the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) had failed to agree on even sufficient services, with more and more people travelling on the railways at the start of the Christmas holidays.
According to the reports, the strike will be held at BKV from the start of the operation until 1 p.m. from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike is organized by the trade unions of workers in the energy industry LIGA, and a 2-hour and 2-8 hour stoppage is called for by the trade union of teachers and the Democratic trade union of teachers.
The Hungarian doctors' union will strike in rotation across the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is organizing a two-hour alert strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions, which will be in force from next year, should be introduced gradually.
Third, early retirement should be made possible for the relevant occupations before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Railway Workers' Union (VDSZSZ), which is part of the Liga trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the railway sections and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was established with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért in August of this year, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several ways, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute.
The company's 'risk warning' states that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that 'violent ethnic clashes may soon occur as a result of the intensification of the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary'.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such action, the research institute adds.
He writes that this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political representatives: "the public discussion on the Roma question was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could base their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict".
This deepens the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict, the institute said.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, influenced by the great attention of both domestic and foreign media, "have to a great extent distorted the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity", according to the Research Institute.
The Institute recalls that part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which has been gaining more publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, is that several organisations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which call themselves 'National Defence' associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly declaring - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in case of natural disasters, attacks on the homeland, disruption of order), in addition to pointing to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state", he adds.
He further notes: this is all happening in a way that tries to wrap up various political efforts based on society's resistance to politics and parties in civilian clothes.
The emphasis on the citizenship and form of the association is therefore not only a means of avoiding the legal obstacles of judicial registration in the case of such groups, but also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighboring countries as a potential source of danger, and ultra-nationalist politicians in some neighboring countries have sought to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this may have an impact on the political stability of the region", he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so it has increased political risks for the region as a whole.
He writes that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia's districts (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU used this to form the Guardia, saying that the organization's goal is "national defense".
She says that during the past 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced "gypsy terror", but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalls the Political Capital Institute.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a stormy debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will form their own guards as a sign of resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own national guard, as we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
He said that they publish a risk analysis every year and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, the days of rest are strictly regulated by law and it has become common practice to move working days around the holidays, which will be less frequent next year.
The European Union and America have different holidays.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and days of rest.
The days off are usually associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate New Year's Day: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are a holiday - on New Year's Day, people can rest after New Year's Eve.
We have a total of 11 holidays during the year.
The national holidays are 15 March, commemorating the 1848 revolution, and 23 October, commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1st we celebrate labor, November 1st and 2nd we commemorate the dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day holidays, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, state, or religious holidays rarely fall on weekends, it has become a practice to shift the working day in cases where we work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, of course, is that we stay at work and school the Saturday before.
The time for the day immediately preceding or following the holiday to be worked out has been regulated for many years by a special decree of the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, to civil servants and to public servants.
It does not, however, apply to undertakings and institutions which are in operation without interruption or which, for their own purposes, operate on working days.
This year, the change in the work schedule will take place just around the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, as experience has shown that most people "work" in advance or take advantage of the holidays they have saved between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Next year, we're going to have a few holidays in the middle of the week, so there's less shift work than this year.
The first time, the calendar will be changed around Labor Day, so that workers can stay home for four days of trial.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, can be a day of rest.
Another shift is due to the holiday of 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be the working day instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year, however, will be a holiday for the next year, since New Year's Day falls on Wednesday, but from December 24 on, almost everywhere will be a nonstop holiday.
Six Scarecrow Tricks to Anger Your Coworkers
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never get, innocent lies we barely notice: all of these things "spoil" our everyday work.
The question is, do you get used to these little inconveniences, or do you put on gloves and avoid the vague situations that might upset others?
The tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that the marketing department was looking for you", your colleague will tell you.
That you missed the meeting because of that?
At best, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver the message (which is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's a matter of an apology.
Before embarrassing excuses are made, it is good to think about what you might do to cause discomfort to your colleagues and to consciously try to avoid it.
You borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than reaching for some paperwork, office supplies, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a stitch on the table yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on one of your colleagues' desk that you considered lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll rightly be angry at you for going through their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or sticky papers out of the office, as it may be uncomfortable to run out of them prematurely and you will need them immediately.
Gossiping about the private lives of your colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the rumors from spreading.
Who, with who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not leak your private life reports to everyone!
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his confidence!
Keep what you hear to yourself, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his affairs.
You're reporting your absence without reason?
If you call the office and report a severe headache, saying that you are not feeling well, or you think you would rather rest today, remember that your work, your urgent tasks, and your deadline work will have to be done by someone else.
Keep an eye on your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not be able to go to work the next day or that something may happen that will require you to stay home, make an announcement so that your colleagues and supervisors are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
The grumbling, the whining, the phone calls.
You've been immersed in a job that's been brutally ripped out by the giggling of a coworker?
You accidentally witnessed a telephone conversation that you would rather not hear?
Do not disturb your coworkers by moaning, chanting, shouting (over their heads), or blowing, constantly cursing, loudly disgruntling.
All of this can be distracting even when they're not involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
You blame others for your mistakes?
If something is not on time or you forget to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Don't appeal to the possible chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you could make things right, correct the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
T-shirts and slippers: comfortable at home, but not in the office!
Don't wear clothing for leisure, even if your profession allows it!
Don't be lazy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming into the office in plain clothes - and if your profession requires it, neatly and elegantly!
When you want to fit in, you're not interesting anymore.
A little bit of a morning congestion.
The radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of violins with electronic effects.
I'm adding volume to it.
The music changes tempo, and the bass is added to the previous tone, then the female chorus joins in as a true gem.
Mr. 2 is playing a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
It's been a long time since the home music scene has been spoiled by high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the congestion is different because you're listening to Zagaru's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboy, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the overall picture, and although garage rock with its guitar beating is back in style, home electropopop is proving that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started out in Pentecostal and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until finally - perhaps because two dudes don't fit into one line - he went his own way.
However, his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, only began to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The film "Season" by Ferenc Török.
His band, which started out playing in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their 2002 debut album among the 50 most important home records and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only home development entity that could be marketed in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "on the course", although of course no one asked them if they were happy with this label.
The band responded in the right way: they made a new, better album.
The now released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new avenues for them, although the title itself attempts to create a continuity with the early flights in the Pentecostal.
It's a line from an old Balázse Zságer band.
The reference to ethereal, flying would have been appropriate, but alongside the ethereal inspiration of this music there now appeared - in keeping with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, an influence of rock and roll.
These songs feature singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, at the premiere of the album at Millenáris Park.
The album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music from morning to evening, we began to catch the impressive melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine?
The portal hvg.hu has confessed to Balazs Zyaser.
hvg.hu: In the context of this new hit, the question is, how much of what you play is still fringe music?
The definition of "marginal music" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different kinds of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can be shallow, it doesn't say anything, and it can just be created for the sake of selling, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is received, regardless of language or national borders, also works.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Z. In foreign countries, especially in our West, light music has a more traditional style.
Not only do teenagers and people in their 20's go to concerts there, but older people do too.
They are much more aware of the changes that light music is making around them, because they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how many people listen to your music?
BS: Of course, it's a good feeling that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never did music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more visible at concerts where interaction is already at work, but it is only hidden in the unattainable changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that when you try to please the audience, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow Yonderboy's lead?
He's a solo artist, and he's built his career out west of here.
BS: We don't actually go down his path, although that's how they sometimes try to explain our music.
We're more like team players, relying on each other's musical presence and letting it unfold.
Of course, at first, we couldn't avoid being compared to Yonderboy, because a few of us had broken away from his band and gone our separate ways.
In the top of the list of mr2 Petőfi station, the song Wings of Love has reached the first place.
Many people heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up to a wider audience with a more popular style?
B.Z. We weren't planning on writing a hit to sell the record.
There's more to the song.
We thought of it as a final album, trying to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to put together this choir of soloists from the house music scene with good voices.
So we got this six-piece choir together - Sena, Edina Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we renamed the Underground Divas.
Is that exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls make something up on it?
B.Z. The song had been around for a long time in an instrumental version, and then when the material came together on the record, we thought we needed something else to do with this song.
The chord sequence was tempting to be joined by a singing group.
That night I sang a tune to it that the girls later learned.
It was almost the first time and it was so spontaneous.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it took the Divas to do it.
It wouldn't work with my voice like that.
Both on the record and at the concert, it seemed like the girls were in the background.
They don't have solos (except for Judy Jay), they don't have their own parts, they sing all together, and they're no louder than the music, so the music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were also standing in the back of the stage.
Did you do it on purpose?
BZ: The fact that they were standing in the back was just a technical problem.
The fact that we didn't want to split up the solo roles is deliberate.
Even this song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where we are from, where we belong, and just letting those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wished that the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born, others would feel.
Which one was the most work?
B.Z. During the composition of the music, not even with one, the heavier pieces occurred more during the mixing.
Like Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, and then it all kind of slowly found its place in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
BZ: That's always changing with the gigs and the fact that I've already "released" the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A rogue broker risked billions on the undervalued
A fraud of the heart.
That's what the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the Commercial Bank of France, calls his shy employee Jerome Kerviel.
She lost almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to match his teammates and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banking houses, he spotted the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market early.
"He's mentally weak", his superiors said, sending the police after him.
But as Kerviel's testimony, reported by French media such as Le Monde, shows, he was a man who had a turnover of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis is not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he says in the deposition.
He managed to make half a billion euros during the summer of the American crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had had problems with repayment in the past, would be in trouble.
The whole economy was not meant to be affected by this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet it right.
By the end of the year, its profit had climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
"I didn't know how to announce it when I made my first half a billion", Kerviel admits, adding that he hadn't kept anything for himself.
He admits throughout the interrogation that he falsified the records so that he wouldn't be found.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even as the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his trades.
The risk was the gain.
Was he afraid he'd be found out?
I guess not.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
Where did he get the will to take that risk?
He had to work his way up in his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 shortly after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and in 2005, he became a freelance broker with a salary of $90,000 a year.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as the others.
"I knew I was being watched from my first interview in 2005.
For my education and also for my professional and personal development", Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after the launch, the first big breakthrough came.
Allianz's stock was profitable, because during the London bombings, he bet half a billion euros on the loss of the title.
And that was the trigger mechanism -- he wanted more.
While you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew everything, or they suspected it.
"While I was making money, they were blindfolded".
But then came the early morning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
He wanted to wipe it out after the weekend in mid-January.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros.
How did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only picked four days for the past year.
A broker who is not on leave is a broker who does not want his records looked at", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers and the European Commission representatives signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic could receive EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is approximately half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will be allocated to the regions from the seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion CZK from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90,8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds to implement new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful of the newly admitted countries in so far as EU funds are concerned.
The 20-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua confirmed by the court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud totaling $100 million.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether they let Alemán serve his sentence at home or travel to prison.
A court four years ago found Alemán to have regularly transferred government money to foreign corporate accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money ended up in a fund that Alemán set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget.
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been passed.
What makes this budget so special?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and passed by a coalition majority without opposition support.
This year's proposal was passed with the support of the Czech Socialist Party last year, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the Czech Socialist Party could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives passed this traditionally overlooked, though most influential, bill quietly.
It's a paradox.
Every government starts and ends with a chapter and a budget item, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it's hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
It's more appreciative of the media, and that's why it gets a lot more media attention.
Politicians' guesses are far more interesting to the public than the rough numbers.
The state budgets of the previous social democratic governments suffered from three problems which the 2008 government was unable to solve all at once:
The first is the high proportion of the law on mandatory expenditure, which is not only pensions but also social benefits, which was approved by the silent "coalition" of the CPSU and the KSČM last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit management resulting from the mismanagement of the first.
The third limit is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It's public and relatively controlled.
But the time bomb is the deficit in the budgets of the cities and municipalities.
In order to obtain additional investment resources, in addition to tax, fee, and bank loans, many mayors often rashly issued bonds that unduly indebted their municipalities.
In previous years, they have managed to pay off these debts by selling off shares in the energy and other distribution networks they received from the state in privatisation.
Now they don't have that resource.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years now, which is why the CIS continues to boast.
This was a unique opportunity for her government to put the public finances in order.
Instead, the state became more and more indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, have managed much more intelligently than our republic.
It's a huge shame, and it's mostly down to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least at risk of poverty.
This is why we do not need massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have unnecessarily grown to gigantic proportions in recent years.
While we've managed to reverse some of the nonsensical populist spending approved this year before the election, if we don't move the retirement age and reform the pension system in the near future, then, in fact, all politics in this country will be over, and whoever rules will be just bureaucracy.
With a little exaggeration, the ruling politicians will become civil servants, mechanically distributing most of the tax money into pensions and social benefits.
This is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the pushing of normal expenditure to mandatory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely useless if the previous governments had not done their best in the last ten years.
If we do not want to see the ruling politicians become mere bureaucrats, then we must be patient and allow this not-too-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get in taxes and fees, time to prepare further reform legislation.
Only these will allow the progressive achievement of a balanced state budget.
The following is a list of the names of the Member States:
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
This will bring over $100 billion into the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks bid at the interest rate at which they are willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will send $40 billion to auction, and the other $24 billion will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or mitigate the effects of the financial crisis.
"This move is to address the economy's biggest problem, namely the growing shortage of free capital that banks could lend", Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his client report.
"Coordinated central bank action has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in defaulted loans, primarily in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more to go.
"Central banks must be really worried about what might still follow if they decide to take this action", said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad", he added.
Central banks are concerned that if they have difficulty accessing loans themselves, they will be reluctant to lend to their customers.
That would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still wary of lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada, and Britain had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another rate cut", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank's move will help to alleviate the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, which is the collapse of the U.S. housing market.
Klaus: The environmental debate is incredible
Global climate change is set to hurt the developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now been lifted at the closing UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, the unacceptable is not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are substitutes for solutions to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech president, when presenting his book, stressed that the subject matter is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appeared in a German translation, because, he said, "I often meet only with caricatures of my views".
Now, then, interested ones can read his unadulterated views.
Klaus reminded him that although he is not a climate scientist, he feels qualified to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and evaluate professional papers, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book were that the climate is constantly changing and therefore normal, that there is no consensus among all scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Furthermore, as a person who has experienced totalitarianism, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction on freedom.
He repeatedly explained to those present that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between cost and benefit".
Klaus spoke about the same thing in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver 's license failed to replace 600,000 people
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to replace their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to request an exchange, so that the authorities can issue them a new ID by the end of the year.
But the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the only people who didn't change their license were those who didn't want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a sharp drop in interest in changing drivers' licenses, Metropolitan authorities are inundated with requests and interest in changing licenses has surged this week.
The magistrate's office handles about 2,000 clients a day.
The line is about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences.
It takes 20 days to issue a new card.
However, extradition may be requested within a shorter period of five days.
In that case, the driver will pay 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory change by the end of the year and drive on the road without a valid driver's license will face fines from January.
The perpetrator will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But a cop can also deal with a misdemeanor.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is increased to 2500 crowns.
According to the earlier information, a man who doesn't go anywhere could get a ticket from the city.
He could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously urged the authorities to be moderate and impose a fine of 1,000 crowns maximum.
But according to Transport Ministry spokesman Karl Hanzelka, 10,000 fines are not a threat to anyone.
He sees a driver's license as a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a valid ID that everyone has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their license.
Just take it or send it by registered mail to the appropriate municipal office.
The end of the year will see the expiry of the licence issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with IDs from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with the gang David Berdych, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
The Prague Supreme Court decided definitively, reducing their sentences by one year and two years.
The detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime were originally facing 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision is no longer subject to appeal, only to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is still awaiting the verdict at first instance.
However, in other trials, he has already received sentences totalling more than 16 years.
That's all she can get.
In January, the district court found 19 people guilty of participating in robbery, and today the Supreme Court heard appeals from 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the charges since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among others, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Horseman.
The indictment concerns gang activity between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of power of a public official and the illicit acquisition of arms.
During home searches, police found illegal handguns, steel-core bullets, laser sights, and machine guns.
The gang allegedly made off with tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the nearly 20 men in this trial, courts have now validly found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of robbery.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still standing before the court in a different trial, some cases have not yet been brought to trial.
The main story has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The bill for the exchange of children: 12 million
In exchange for the children in the maternity ward, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleb, demands from Trebizond Hospital 12 million crowns in damages, plus court costs.
Three million each for the mother, two million for the father, and one million for the children.
The hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál therefore disagrees with the proposal of Veleba.
"We reject such a demand, it's very, very high", he said.
"But in order to have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has had drawn up.
We'll see if it's of any telling value.
We remain of the opinion that it will be in the statistical for all", he stressed.
He said the amount would be between $100,000 and $200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablonnova wanted a million crowns for every month that they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb was informed by an expert opinion prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Praga-Motel, which served as the basis for negotiations on compensation.
Parents of children have suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depth, according to psychologists and psychiatrists.
Men were better able to cope with stress, even though they were faced with the guilt of not preventing the newborn's exchange.
Women are having a hard time coping with the reality of the trauma they've experienced and what's happening right now, Veleb summarized.
Veronica and Nikola were switched nurses at the Třebíč maternity hospital last December 9th.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermakov family in Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jablonyov.
Hejtman of the Highlands Miloš Vystrčil handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families at the end of October to compensate for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Trebice hospital, which the region is establishing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against liability for damage.
In the event of a failure, they must contact the reserve fund, and may exceptionally request the assistance of the founder.
Until now, the courts have awarded people relatively low compensation, with amounts in the hundreds of thousands, and exceptionally millions, of crowns, according to tables.
Soup has lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
The Bolekovka has lost a dispute over the trademark of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava District Court, although the name was first used by the King of Wallachia, the project built a long-term team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Soup didn't attend today's meeting.
But his lawyer says the case is unlikely to end, and the client will appeal.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabis and his team are parasitic on the popularity of the Soup Bolt", said the Soup's lawyer after the trial.
He says that when people hear the words "the kingdom of Valash", they think of the actor and the comedian.
Harabis is of the same opinion.
"We've been working for almost a decade.
Making money and making deals", he said.
He says the reason is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and could be profitable.
They want to parasitize our work", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the appellate court, the first time the Walsh king used the soup on his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But at the time, it had nothing to do with the idea of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabis came up with the idea of issuing Walsh passports.
From the original recessionary action, trade and lucrative business activity emerged, which Harabiš then followed up by founding the Kingdom of Wallachia Company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to put his name and signature on passports and even offered their holders discounts on visiting his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used a bare idea that Polívka had published in the briefing for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav's Walsh Kingdom Soup project certainly helped", the judge said.
But she added that the heart of the project was Harabis and his team, who were intensely involved.
The cooperation of the now-disagreed parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for the soup in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polivka and Harabis began to accumulate, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, elected for life".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by singer Jarmila Šulaáková as queen mother at the urging of Harabis.
Then in 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabis and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clearly, it could bring into dispute the Harabis' impending bid for the throne and half the princess.
He should be the next king.
He wouldn't give details or a date.
"We don't want to rush things.
It should be like the kings' ride on the Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period.
Mr. Soup can join in", Harabiš added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: the prejudices are disappearing
To tell you the truth, I've never been much of a Peugeot 206 fan.
Its driving qualities were not very good, the quality of the arrangement, the handling and also the production could be called sub-standard at times.
But now there's a successor to the Peugeot 207, and it's much better.
And the van called SW is a little further along, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I was testing a classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the backseat, for example.
That's the end of the complaint, because the bodywork of the van means that even two-meter-tall people won't suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I'll go inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty good design, where I only have one complaint about the poor central tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more designer invention here, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we might complain about short seats or armrests.
The sidewalls have also been significantly improved over the 206 model.
As for the space, you can feel the body size increase here too.
Then the aforementioned lack of space overhead disappears in the van.
Suitcases in the trunk
So the main thing in this car is his trunk.
I must rate it as very accessible (also thanks to the pop-up rear window) and as decently consistent.
The deaf areas are equipped with restraint tyres, which are an ideal compromise.
It's unobtrusive, it's flexible, and it can hold even heavier objects.
But let's just think about volume together.
The table shows that the base arrangement is 428 litres, which is rather an average value against the competition.
But not against the best-selling car in the Czech Republic in this class - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the young Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a very noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I were to point out the positives, I'd have to mention a completely flat floor after the second row of supports folded or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a power output of 88 kW.
And to be honest, this is what a 1600 should look like when it's powered by a family hatchback.
It's quiet, low-power, and mostly pulls.
When I compare it to the pest period, which sometimes seems to have a stuffed rag in the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The price list will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
But we must remember that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of a car with a petrol fourteen for 329,900 CZK is still going down.
Our unit costs from $1,500, which is quite enough.
Premium test equipment will then be supplied with equipment for an additional CZK 80,000.
But we had the head airbags, the air conditioning, the automatic start of the wipers, the electric controls on the rear windows...
It's just that the car costs $1,500.
It's a lot, but if you add up the extra equipment at Fabia's, you'll come up with a very similar number.
So, all we have to do is decide on a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is failing
The increase in children from Eastern European countries in British schools has raised concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has faced a number of obstacles so far.
British schools even record instances of conflicts between immigrant and indigenous children escalating into violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in North Kent, where disputes are starting to escalate between local settlers and Slovak immigrants.
The quarrels, bullying, and fights among the students also spread to the relationships between the parents.
The situation got so bad that in Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
She pleaded guilty to the offense of being insulted by the boy with racist slurs.
Police had to intervene after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls reportedly made racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"As we were walking home, a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he leaned on us with apples and pears, and then revealed his ass", described another unpleasant incident for The Times by the mother of the Slovak students.
Complaints are coming from both sides.
One local resident even described his quarrels with Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools is becoming tense between locals and immigrants.
There are 70,000 registered Slovaks in Britain who have come here to work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It's truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can be yours if you choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you'll find it in a more complete and even richer list.
But there is one island that is much more than that, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
During the Spanish conquest, Cuba was the stronghold of their conquest of the Americas.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a storehouse and transshipment point for the treasures the Spanish looted in the Americas and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional was built in the late 1920s.
He had it built by one of the American mafia bosses Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under Prohibition) was welcome in Cuba and encouraged drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
I mean, you know, Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Havana was a city of high-rise buildings, with wide boulevards lined with cars that were iconic symbols of the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a mansion in San Francisco de Paula, just outside of Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, celebrities from show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
The bar at the expensive Nacional Hotel will serve you a cocktail of your choice.
And those iconic cars from the '50s still drive around Havana, because the once-imported jiggles and fiats have long since rotted in that salty, damp air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is in ruins, nowhere else in the vicinity are so many beautiful colonial monuments.
Other places are turning into beauty, too, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in so much needed money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another delicacy that is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by train travelers.
A third of the vast plantations were towed to sugar mills by steam and motor trains on narrow tracks.
Their fleet has not been updated for many decades, so there are working machines to be seen, whose counterparts are nowhere else but in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not pass.
And so, Varadero or Havana, you don't have to write too much.
Just to remind you, there is a museum at the aforementioned Hemingway estate, and if you like this writer, you should not miss a visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viñales Valley in the west of the island.
The vegetation grows from the limestone floor.
The mud, limestone, and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, and their cavities have been filled with fertile soil, which has covered even the wind-blown rocks with dense vegetation.
The valley is home to perhaps the finest Cuban tobacco.
You can see the final form of the cigar if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Some might find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean play was filmed there.
The following is a list of the
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
He was brought fame and wealth by the slave trade and sugar.
The wealth was translated into the beauty and exuberance of a small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has remained largely unchanged for four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that until the 1950's, there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built, and therefore nothing was cut, and everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, it is worthwhile to visit the nearby attractions, such as Playa Ancón or the Valley of the Sugarcane.
Then in the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and where the music dies down over the morning.
Other
A town in the far east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful town on the island.
Indeed, such a view is influenced by the journey itself.
Both roads leading from Guantanamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through a nature almost untouched by human activity.
The eastern part of the island has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unspoiled nature.
They make the best chocolate, they have the Columbus cross in the church (actually made about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage), and from the hill where the former castle and today's hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, the African religions that follow the descendants of slaves somewhere, all of these could be described in many pages.
But, as they say, it's better to see once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans claim
The United States says that the lack of troops and equipment is affecting the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years, according to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, according to a consensus in Edinburgh, Scotland, between the leaders of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has urged NATO forces to step up this week, the United Kingdom sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid.
"Developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start the economic and security development themselves", British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
90% of the
Afghan insurgent activity is at its highest level in five years, according to U.S. military data.
Violent acts have increased by 27 percent over the past year, and in the southern province of Helmand, by as much as 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
But according to the United States, the Allies had reached the limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they're asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We're going to have to think seriously about the specific goals for the coming time and how we're going to achieve them", Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been a dispute in recent months between the countries involved about whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for being passive.
"The Germans have a fairly large presence in Afghanistan.
But they're deployed in areas where there's minimal violence and the demands of combat are not as high as we have in the southern and eastern parts of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan thugs exposed: Germans playing while our boys fight", the Sun wrote in a piece of material accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt to reach trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to the improved state budget management.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
However, since June, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech owes more than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could not cross the trillion-krone mark until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns", said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikora says: "We could reach the one trillion mark in 2009.
Exactly when will depend on the next budget, which we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, that politicians would be willing to save more, it could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don't expect that to change", he said.
The debts are growing
The public debt is the central government's debt and is mainly the result of the cumulation of the state budget deficit.
The public debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has so far this year increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt has so far this year increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable public debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the public debt has increased to 6.5 years.
"Total debt rose 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform is here", commented Data Pikora.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing and debt management strategy shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to the improved state budget management.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the projected 91.3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are CZK 13,3 billion, a reserve of CZK 10 billion for pension payments, financing of government bonds of CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1,8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison and deported by a Khartoum court on Thursday evening, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of having six- to seven-year-old pupils name a teddy bear after Muhammad despite any depiction of the prophet of Islam being forbidden.
She was punished with a whip.
The British teacher, aged 54, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code after parents of several students lodged a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins back in September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the teddy bear in the classroom.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah, and Muhammad", says school principal Robert Boulos.
After the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose the most popular name, Muhammad.
Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but it is also a very common Christian name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for their class with a picture of a bear and the caption: "My name is Muhammad".
The bear itself had no label with the name, but the problem is that the very depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of her Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and would never do anything that might offend any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", which he said was just an "innocent mistake".
This view is shared by many of her students, who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and add that "she never talks about religion in class".
Remember, the first name Mohammed is also the second most common first name in the UK, spelled 14 different ways in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this baptismal name?
For example, is it possible to give them to toys?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
The last round of negotiations in Vienna this Wednesday failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Failure in the end.
Serb and Kosovo Albanians concluded the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the two sides have not been able to reach an agreement on the status", European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His US counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to peace and to be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence anytime soon, but we are entering a difficult period", he added, adding that "it is clear that the situation is tense".
Negotiations close on December 10th
The Troika of negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the population is Albanian-speaking, could be seen in a brighter light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to deliver their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, are the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN gave the Troika new negotiating powers in August.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on December 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo at the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community administration, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement", said the president of the Kosovo government, Fatmir Sejdi, at the Baden hotel, where the "last-chance talks" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and future premier of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "domino effect" in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, however", he said, "it does not mean that compromise is impossible".
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be made exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"The Kosovo parliament will have the final say"
"The only solution acceptable to Serbia is the one that came from the Security Council", declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"This negotiation lasted two years.
It must end the way it began: on the grounds of the Security Council".
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament", adding that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be "after agreement" with the West.
Bush has forced a deal on the Israelis and the Palestinians.
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his instigation, U.S. President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything to help them reach a "peace agreement" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides under the "roadmap" to peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the talks between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority are aimed at "concluding a peace agreement that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues".
The declaration covers three issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the 1948 conflict in what is now the State of Israel.
Abbas followed the US president and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "comprehensive and thorough" and should touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert then took the floor, expressing his view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it should be agreed to conclude during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for realizing his "vision of two states", one Palestinian and one Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it had made a commitment to this effect from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories taken in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis stands for "a crossroads in Middle Eastern history, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and against its central aspects", Prince Saud said in an interview with an Arabic-language newspaper protected by Saudi capital.
The D.A. says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news stories from the black chronicle, the official version does not match what is being said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accidents?
According to the initial results of the investigation by the Inspection Générale de la Police Nationale (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in the interception mode, but was on patrol and was travelling at 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on", the police source explains.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore not authorized to travel on public transport" (see below), driven by two young men without helmets, was travelling at "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the police car from the left side after failing to turn right", one officer explained.
Blood alcohol test on the crew came back negative.
The condition of the vehicle (puncture of the front, shattered windscreen, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, reacted very quickly, announcing yesterday morning that she had entrusted the IGPN with the investigation of "acts of manslaughter and failure to assist persons in danger", which is also being carried out by the Direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of the Regional Police of the Val-d'Oise Department).
At the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police for the accident.
Three witnesses to the accident who were questioned Sunday night confirmed "the police's version that the mini-torpedo approached them relatively quickly from the left".
Some creak, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the cliff on the ground, yesterday showed that both vehicles remained trapped until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo a technical examination.
Both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, speculation spread that the police had to leave the scene of the crime without giving the two young men first aid.
The IGPN should also have, with all caution, ruled out 'any serious misconduct' in this respect.
"It's a more challenging aspect of the investigation that requires more investigation and that needs to be handled very carefully", the police source pointed out.
The journal Libération met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to the scene of the accident.
"Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, and I ran down to try to resuscitate them", the Witness relates.
There was nothing we could do".
Then he saw "a limp, totally terrified policeman.
Two others tried to resuscitate one of the young men, and the fourth was talking on the phone".
Faced with rapidly growing tensions and the certainty of those present that the situation of the youngsters was hopeless, the police were driven away by a car of colleagues who had meanwhile arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also did a heart massage, but to no avail.
"Let no one say that the police authorities did not help the young men.
First aid was given to these young men.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to save them", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions in Pakistan are rising
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades, which witnesses said were used by law enforcement.
The last names responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers assaulted and injured lawyers.
Several of them were supposed to be subpoenaed.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers won the support of religious parties in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "has urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who took the oath before Musharraf".
"Musharraf's promise is not valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is the direct target of the state of emergency declared on Saturday night.
In the following days, he was to speak about the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election held on 6 October.
The President of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court's rulings", the official told The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to relinquish the military leadership and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the imposition of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first term as president ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied ongoing speculation in the country that the Deputy Chief of Army Staff had ordered President Musharraf to be placed under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies still consist of unexpected pregnancies
This figure includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as those that were poorly planned or unexpected.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study by the French Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law, which legalized contraception in France.
This figure includes unintended pregnancies (24%) as well as those that were poorly planned or unexpected.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still have a failure rate of 5 to 6 percent, estimates Ined.
The institute says that the introduction of contraception has only made it possible to improve "fertility control", noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception among women between the ages of 20 and 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One in five couples even have their births calculated for the month, preferably in spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year to have a baby.
Remarkable Repair of the Space Station
More than seven hours in space took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to remarkably repair the torn solar panel needed for the station's further scientific activity.
It was a risky spacewalk that set records for duration, distance from the habitable modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the amount of "bitterness" the astronauts spent on repairs.
The problems emerged on Tuesday as astronauts on the Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to house European and Japanese science laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pin for the module-laboratories.
But you need to be able to power them.
The second task of the crew was to move the 17-and-a-half-ton solar-powered module already on the ISS to its final anchorage.
After relocating it, the crew began to disassemble the module's 700-foot solar panels.
And in that one of the panels, which was decomposing like a drag accordion, was damaged by a cable splash, about a meter in area.
The decommissioning was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a check-out on the Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had malfunctioned, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship attached to the arm of the station and perform the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
Tall, stout, very agile, with a very developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original doctor was assigned to "operate" on a "wounded" solar panel.
After examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed a "roof" on the damaged areas.
He was assisted by another spacewalker who stayed close to the equaliser, and also from inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The equipment he used, a mini hockey stick surrounded by insulation to prevent electric shock from solar panels producing several hundred volts, was invented and "made to order" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disassembled, then inventoried his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day break before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery spacecraft to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defence company announced that it would have to spend EUR 1,2 to 1,4 billion to face the delay of the A400M.
EADS has lost 4% and is now listed on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reassess its projected production results for 2007 due to delays resulting from the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the maiden flight.
The price for the delay in the delivery of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at '€1.2 to €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion for Airbus', the parent company of European aircraft manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to report a new earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) forecast when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday.
The Group also disclosed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the production results of EADS in 2006 decreased by 86%, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
The group originally envisaged delivering the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Deciding on the status quo
Sunday's election will be held without much anticipation: Russians will vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming, after a very few free campaigns, their desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded television message to voters on public television stations, the contents of which are kept secret.
He's doing so from the position of leader of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party that looks set to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president kept his mouth shut and settled for another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the value of true democracy and we want the fairest, most transparent and open elections possible, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it is far from that.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there have never been so dirty elections, even under Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on the demonstration last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, is still banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have retained the homo sovietica mentality"
In the context of these parliamentary elections, which are free of tense expectations, two more open questions are emerging:
- "Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official gazette yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
But no successor appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
He's going to be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will elect the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling party will win the parliamentary elections, as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have retained the homo sovietica mentality, they do not feel they are masters of their own destiny", believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
St. Petersburg State University historian Nikolai Kopossov notes a more distant connection: civil society was late in this country, Christianized five centuries after Europe; that famous collective spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror but by a certain economic prosperity", believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians are "voluntarily renouncing personal responsibility", which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run local candidates for the United Russia.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čeredničenko, a professor of 45 years: "Why think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Memory loaded
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives at Bad Arolsen, which chronicle the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored over a 27 km distance in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were up to that time only accessible for 'humanitarian' purposes, i.e. individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorised persons.
In May, 11 countries that manage the archives - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed to open them to scholars and historians.
As the ratification process of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening took effect yesterday.
The following information shall be provided:
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to study "particularly the movements of prisoners, the camp population and the health of forced laborers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were against making these named documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some of the information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental disabilities of some deportation victims.
Concentration camp or arrest warrant registries compiled by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labored civilians, providing them with evidence of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent staff in Bad Arolsen are still handling tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some in the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents", said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin, in 2006.
EU and India aim to reach free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already close to EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting a free trade agreement to be signed in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's number one trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its number one foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The free trade agreement will be a huge boost for both economies" and "India will have better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", argued Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of India's top 10 exports, the European Commissioner said.The Asian and European giant combined trade "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services" annually, said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi this week, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential".The EU and India will meet on Friday for the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmo Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 to supplement this Decision.
The Bank of England has acknowledged the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England on Thursday announced its intention to ease current concerns about a further deterioration in credit market conditions by announcing a bid of £10 billion in a five-week auction at a base rate of 5.75%, an unusually long bid.
The Bank's financial position is expected to remain stable throughout the year, and the Bank's reserves will be available for the first time in the next five years.
The Bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be thus placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the basic interest rate.
It appears to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
The BOE adds in its statement that it 'remains ready to take further measures to keep the interest rates' of interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank overnight rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The quarterly interest rate has settled at 6,6%, the highest figure since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates which have discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations, reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many people preferred to have the money placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank at lower rates and with greater discretion.
The UMP (Union for a Popular Movement) and the NC (New Centre) refuse to consider the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
The draft law was put on the agenda in the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by individual parliamentary clubs) and contained a dozen measures adopted by the PS presidency on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the renewal of fluctuating TIPPs, a transport check or the regulation of rent.
As the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an occasion for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on affordability.
The leader of the PS, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club would submit these proposals in full as addenda to the amendment to the Finance Bill, which will be debated in the House next week.
A new festival is born
Following much speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is launching a new festival, this promoter/producer of Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with Festival Republic has announced British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a man who has inspired the modern festival movement in America without exaggeration", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 is producing the Chicago Lollapalooza and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to run from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most acclaimed festival organizers.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organising duties at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of 177,500.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says his firm and Melvin Benn's firm are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as the marketplace, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
"We have worked with the city and the Commission has been motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, however, the current city government has left us with a political agenda, adds Charlie Jones.
"Luckily, we've had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn, "and we're about to establish a great festival in a unique location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia".
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005 after excelling on the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross revenues of the two events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benn festival takes place in the countryside, whereas our festivals take place more in green spaces in the cities", says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine the two concepts in a way that creates both the impression of a European rural festival and an American urban festival".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The city of Vineland, including the mayor, is very supportive of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims "that they are sufficiently advantageous to allow investing in such an event and welcoming a festival that will hopefully last a long time".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of the festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which holds 80,000 people.
He says invitations have already been sent out to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed as the program is being put out in print.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied, so that we can appeal to a wide range of audiences", says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at last year's Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to attract Hollywood studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself is opposed...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's duties.
His term is "politically challenging" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to fall into the "Governor"'s clutches?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds conditions in Montreal favorable, he will go.
Our job is to offer what they think is best", he said.
The Hunt for Festivals
For now, though, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote a local film.
The Oscar hunt is on.
At all the West Coast festivals, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's going to be about introducing Quebec films, bringing them to the attention of the public, and making sure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages got a lot of publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It's going to be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is in Santa Monica and will premiere in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will the stock market be a marathon at the end of the year?
With less than five weeks left until the end of the fiscal year, investors are already holding hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year marathon.
But this year, experts are not so sure it will happen.
The Bank considers that 'the stock market is statistically positive in December'.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, particularly because in the current context markets raise certain doubts, at least in the short term.'
These experts do not expect the stock exchange to move in the final weeks of the year, stating that 'the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity ready to invest in view of the lack of collateral alternatives, in particular the fixed income affected by the effect of the turnover on quality securities, both in the long and short run'.
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will be more likely to be calm, rather than volatile, "mainly because the impact of the likely fall in the Fed's (Federal Reserve System) rates, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inducing inflationary pressures, is not known".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that now is not the right time to boldly declare that there will be a marathon.
"There is not much to rejoice about", the expert assures.
The Ibex lost almost 4% of its highs recorded on 8 November, when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16 000 points thanks to the portfolio rearrangement and traditional pension contributions that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year things will be a little different, as he believes the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the extended Constitution Day weekend.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "therefore we could observe a reflection of the index triggered by the news from the US on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will ensure that Ibex reaches new maximum quotas.
Solana at Intermoney confirms that "this year is a series on strong headlines".
This expert would include both major banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to make a fortune from this marathon, if it happens.
"ACS has been recovering its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will follow suit", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be in the lead in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
The expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also do very well, even if it is not very represented in this field on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December has been a month of decline only twice.
The real end-of-year marathon was in 2003, the fiscal year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (the Ibex has risen by 8,36% since January) and whether it will be able to run its marathon at the end of the year.
The 200 branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of 200 located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches, operated under the Popular Max brand, are a major change for the bank.
The same applies to other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a leap and to bet on continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and to open on Saturdays from 10.00 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group which has also stated on several occasions that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
Meanwhile, it intends to strike a deal with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening hours by one afternoon, though not for the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive in whether or not other entities join this initiative to promote business hours.
That's exactly the goal of the project that Popular Bank has set itself.
To attract individual clients to these places for their shopping, small and medium-sized businesses, tradespeople and shops from selected streets where branches are opened.
The Bank intends to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as this is not the opening of new branches but only the modification of existing ones.
The Bank will therefore modernise the branches it already has in the business areas by adapting them to the profile of the clients on the individual streets.
This extension of opening hours is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colours.
The commercial director of the bank, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment but rather a larger staffing, as it will increase from six employees to eight to nine at the branch.
The branches will even have meeting rooms for SMEs and will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Popular already tested this initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a lucky choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2 500 branches.
And another 60 specialized for immigrants, which are run under the brand Mundocredit, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where many of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' says Rivera.
They just made a deal with Telephone to sell the phones through outside staff.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock exchange doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We did it.
This was the statement made yesterday by Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressing his satisfaction at the conclusion of the sale, when he stated that the television he manages had doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I regret is that it was not because we were growing more, but because we were falling less,' he said.
He stressed that because of the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco closed yesterday trading at a 2.54 percent gain.
This profit pushed their loss for the previous part of the year to 15,66%.
The market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and with a further 13% stake in Vocenta thus amounts to EUR 4 488,88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Its competitor, Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and by 40.5% overall since January, has a half value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies assessed is 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518,53 million in the case of Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is offered, since 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in terms of viewership.'
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel to exceed $1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that provides the group's advertising.
If the forecast were to be met, the channel would see its advertising turnover increase by 3.6% this year, compared with 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Antenna 3's net turnover increased by 1,6% (to 734,4 million), while its net income increased by 0,7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, headed by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to decide, this factor could change after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we can satisfy our shareholders, who have already seen the value of Endemol increased by 33%.'
Analysts say the market is showing some fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco's profit by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
This is because, they explain, the projected growth in revenues has stopped from 0,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antenna 3, by 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
The first.
Ibersecurities: recommends purchasing both securities primarily on the basis of increased dividend yields and long-term sustainable potential.
Two.
Caja Madrid: it rates Telecinco (to collect) better than Antenna 3 (to hold) because of its 'numerous advantages' and the growth of the business.
The third.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not to overvalue them as they face 'similar threats' (a disrupted market and a deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFID effective as of November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary deliberations, which ended today with a vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has submitted to public hearing a regulation that develops the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the efficient functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFI) that are linked to securities companies, securities intermediaries and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of financial instruments is being expanded by the addition of multilateral trading and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with existing stock exchange brokers.
The law also obliges investment firms to disseminate information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk mitigation methods and requires them to keep a record of all operations carried out in order to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
During the Congressional Trade Committee hearing, several amendments were made, notably to make securitised receivables a "complex" financial instrument given the high risk to the investor, as demonstrated by what happened in the US with subprime mortgages.
The transposition of the Directive has also been used to legally define the functions that bachelors in economics and business administration can hold, 30 years after the Royal Decree of 1977 which defined the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate also ordered the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require authorisation from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for different investment firms simultaneously.
The harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November.
This indicator, which is subsequently used by Eurostat to calculate the EU inflation index, provides preliminary information on the price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data on a timely basis and of a quality comparable to that achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is indicative only and therefore may not necessarily correspond to the final figure, which will be known on 14 December this year.
'ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level'
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes declared that the November increase in the ISC to 4,1% is a "temporary figure", but at the same time predicted that the price index will remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the Congressional columns that "although it will not be a favourable figure", Spain's inflation differential against the monetary union has remained "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%", the Minister of Economy said of the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make $42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Since the mid-September crisis, when Northern Rock had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank was managing record deposits of over £25 billion, which were gradually declining over two and a half months due to client distrust despite the government offering a 100% guarantee on the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity name with its Virgin Money trading brand, needs to raise about a quarter of the revenue deposited in UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach its £30 billion target.
The Richard Branson Group, a UK tycoon known for its flashy advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week flagged the offer of a consortium of Virgin, which includes three other companies, as the one they'd prefer to save from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged corruption in construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of Totana, Murcia, in the early hours of this morning for his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices that were uncovered this week.
Also arrested was a city clerk and the local police chief.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current MP and mayor of the municipality until May of this year, who, according to investigating sources contacted by Cadena SER, could have been the 'head' of the whole enterprise.
Police are continuing to monitor the City Hall and the construction commission buildings, and no further arrests are expected in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales, the main suspect in the corrupt construction practices that were exposed earlier this week, was charged with corruption.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested on his way out of Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to the investigation sources, the investigation also concerns Morales' alleged collection of commissions for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono has accepted the offer to lead the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, to preside over the Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to stand in the next general election at the head of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) list in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the general election, become President of the Congress.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE's secretary for the José Blanco organization and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place today at noon at the party's federal headquarters.
The chief executive explained the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha would be the Socialist Party's candidate for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marino as Congress president, who announced on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general election and to leave his active political career to focus on combating climate change in higher education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had been constantly urging him to return to the top political office he left two years ago.
He further stated that just as the citizens know who will be the deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will be the president of the Congress.
If Bono wins the post, he hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect, not of swearing or shouting", and to achieve "increasingly more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunately that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak in peace and quiet is the Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion".
He also praised the current president, Manuel Marin, and "his good work", and refused to put himself in his place, lest he reduce himself to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
The climate propaganda
With the climate movement subject to relentless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show strong solidarity.
And then there's the leader of a movement that's a prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new deal with the planet".
This proposal compels him to explain why the actions or inaction of his government have contributed significantly to Spain's leading position in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors it is happening, and why his government, the treaty government, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it is obliged to explain as clearly as possible to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be harmed, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, will we have to make, and what economic consequences will this have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
But we have not seen such explanations, nor will we.
Because it takes sacrifice and it pays.
Climate change measures, real measures, are not popular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening business and personal accounts.
Even one cent of the petrol price proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) seemed to Zapatero so risky from the point of view of elections that he was quick to reject it.
In other words, it's about saving the planet from being worthless, pure propaganda, with slogans that lack any real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the contracts with the planet; this man so useful to the campaign, who doesn't even speak, doesn't accuse, doesn't demand anything, but is a decoration of the rallies and evokes tenderness.
As long as it's limited to being a virtual party and not asking us to ride a bike and cool off with a fan.
The mayor and the local police chief of Totana arrested on suspicion of corrupt practices in construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, Murcia, the "people's man" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the city secretary and a businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now with a number of police officers who also appeared before the Commission for Construction and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Land and Apartments.
These three arrests were in addition to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation to convert more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into suitable land for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 houses after paying illegal commissions during the last election period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are charged in summary proceedings in the Court of First Instance of the City of Totana.
The first six were brought to trial today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and now a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
Further charges were brought against his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate office registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as was Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, a company belonging to the group and through which bribes were transferred.
The investigation is being carried out by the Crime Unit in the Construction of the Central Operational Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out 11 searches, mostly in companies related to the arrested persons, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, a well-known poultry-processing business owner in the area who could act as a broker.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Totana, Murcia, which would have involved the construction of more than 5 000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the population of the municipality, which has 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of Coruña, Venezuela, and in Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
It happens too
The first.
If you don't mind, we'll put the Book of the Month aside and maybe in the meantime, we'll think of other awards and competitions.
I've got something in my head.
Guys, life is change.
Of course you can come up with ideas.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (which, by the way, is at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), referring to what the newspaper printed on November 18, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn's book happened to appear:
"The content of the philosophy course has penetrated the public debate in connection with the tragedy at the Jokela school.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the education councilor responsible for the philosophy course, demanded in the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic philosophy course in secondary schools".
The third.
One colleague reports on the introduction of the offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a felony with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you sell a record for less than EUR 400 in a shop, it is considered a mere misdemeanour (Section 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 in a shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for withdrawal (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for removal (§ 244.1)
D. It's less serious to get into a fight than to switch compacts.
To participate in riots is punishable by a fine of three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be punishable by a fine of six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by the same penalty as providing pornographic material to minors (§ 186).
So if my colleague's right, someone's got a hand cut off, and it's a big one.
Fourth
My doctor pushes me one of his articles on weird research called "Money Activates the Brain, Especially When Others Get Less".
Neither do the feelings that a monthly salary evokes in employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a CT scanner, and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and head of the Neurocognitive Imaging Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, "The greatest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly".
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they got the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one got double the activation was higher.
I really don't know if that conclusion required that much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
For eight years now, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing war criminals from the Hague prosecutor's office.
Her term of office expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the documentary film "Karlin List" (2006, not released in Spain) by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, which follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in pursuing fugitive criminals and pressuring the states concerned to close the network.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, represents a considerable expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First, we need to figure out what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the policyholder.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurer will receive an agreed amount of insurance for taking on the liability for damages in the event of an insured event.
The insurance premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, status, sex, length of holding of the driving licence, type of vehicle being insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies base their prices on statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
Similarly, on the basis of controls, insurance companies have concluded that married persons have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the ride and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the rides, the more likely they are.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of insurance premiums.
The driver must therefore study the situation carefully in order to choose the insurance that best suits his insured profile.
We will show you the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which will not only suit the type of insured but will also be reasonably priced.
People under 25 face various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and short driving licence periods, when they want to buy insurance at an affordable price.
Although all-hazard insurance is ideal for good cover, there are cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with a discount to get all-risk coverage, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the client's participation in the payment of the insurance event.
'The part of the event that the client will pay will be determined in advance when determining the price of the policy, which will be higher the lower the participation rate,' explains Luis Noguera, CEO of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
The other option is insurance extended to other road users by insuring the client against damage caused to other persons but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
The references.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, the malus is an increase in the basic rate mentioned.
"Bonus and minus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus", explains Noguera.
After the age of 25, it is easier for drivers to get insurance because the client risk index is reduced by the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most advisable to take out all-hazard insurance with a discount.
"Young people are usually unable to use the experience they have gained in advance at the time of the accident, even when driving", assures the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the "fear of a beginner" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but has no children, it is better to take out all-hazard insurance, if his financial situation permits.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies as the clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be all-risk insurance with a premium discount (which could be EUR 300) or, with a high bonus, insurance extended to other road users, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"They drive more calmly and have a higher purchasing power, so they can afford the luxury of the highest discount", notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to take out all-risk insurance with a discount on the premium (EUR 150) or extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is good reason to properly examine the insurance options that would suit us best in view of our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to get to AC Milan point, which means the semi-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will combine their strengths this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an attempt to score the point they are missing to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as it would mean for Italy to be first and for Scotland to decide the place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the lead in the fifth game with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but need one more to make sure they don't get ahead of six-point Shakhtar who will play against Benfica who have four.
These two matches of Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan have to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will enter for the first time on the 13th in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and a draw at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems the most likely, although both teams will try to fight for the win, because the Italians will not want to play on home soil and Celtic know that after winning they would be first and would secure a better place in the semi-finals.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if Shakhtar doesn't win, but they can't count on that because with the same nine points the Ukrainians will advance, who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won in the first straight match (2:0).
And so AC Milan's players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots who believe they will make it to the second semi-final of the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the previous competition by a Kaká goal in extra time (1:0) after a 0-0 draw in the regular season.
The hope of the Rossoneri is to win, and it's only worth it if Celtic lose, both for the semi-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although last and without the chance to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with one win, so they would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was in Vancouver with 20,000 people
The Spice Girls opened in Vancouver, Canada, to 20,000 spectators for their first tour since breaking up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) declared that the reunion of their band was "great" shortly before they opened their show at GM Place in Vancouver.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which included a video that chronicled the history of the band, which caused a sensation in the late 1990's.
The comeback and world tour coincide with the release of their new album, released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main hits as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The Spice Girls Five appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the crowd that flooded GM Place, despite a nervous Victoria forbidding him to do so a few days ago.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he'll think of the show".
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" led to the disbandment of the five-member group two years later, also revealed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion had changed, that the view of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I did", Chisholm said of reuniting the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much".
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So, at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special.
When they arrived, they were met by an army of nannies at the airport.
Five has seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4), and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He's going to Madrid on December 23rd.
Concerns over a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
The dispute over gas prices between Russia and Ukraine is ongoing, raising the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it obtains from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations", Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
'The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.'
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev led to a reduction in Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up sharply.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the EU's gas supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
The NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Controller said the Scottish NHS Chambers must improve criminal record checks on non-European staff.
The recommendation from the President of the High Authority for Control Robert Black came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key controls were all fine on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the High Authority was concerned immediately after the June attacks at Glasgow Airport about personnel recruited from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone rented a Jeep to the main terminal building door.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court via video link accused of being involved in attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chamber is expected to check foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK before they are employed.
Although the Scottish Health Service uses Disclosure Scotland for criminal records checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commissions should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with audits in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly", the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS was in many ways in line with its own pre-employment checks policy, but added: 'Our report points out areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign staff is available.'
Dr Peter Terry, chairman of the BMA Scotland, said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who might commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value the comments will bring", he said.
The Scottish Health Authority has announced that it currently has 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures are likely to be higher also because the committees had difficulty identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established checks procedures at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely being implemented.
They included passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for overseas NHS staff.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport".
She also added that the Scottish Government, in consultation with the Health Committees, would consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices are reflected in the updated pre-employment inspection guidelines for all staff - including foreign - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division have taken over the film awards
Control, a biopic about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, picked up five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The awards also went to Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and Toby Kebell in the supporting role.
Lady Judi Dench has been nominated for best actress for her thriller Notes on Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety award for bringing a British film to the world stage.
The awards were handed out at the Roundhouse in London.
Control chronicles Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - with a soundtrack featuring The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But it won Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of the next award winner -- because the film by Julian Temple about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London thriller The Eastern Promise.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter, Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door to people like me", he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored".
The Independent Film Awards, known as BiFAs, are awarded by a jury made up of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 people for terrorism conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells planning an imminent attack on oil facilities as well as on religious and security elements.
State television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have been waging a campaign against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since 2003, the invasion of Iraq.
Television reports said that a foreign-led cell of eight militants was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction unit to defend the facility from an al-Qaeda failed attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement from the ministry: 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a "missile launching expert" who slipped into the country.
She also said that the militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 of those arrested were supposed to be preparing the murders of clerics and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting against allied forces and the US-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - backed by calls from Saudi al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and power plants.
"This war was a huge effort by the security forces in the last... five months", a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested for promoting "takfirian thought" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into the future of Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may have once been a pleasant place for life.
Data from the European orbiting station show that the planet is even more like the Earth's stubborn twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit on similar orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus had conditions similar to Earth's and could have been habitable.
But the accelerated greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and slower rotation have sent Venus down a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is waterless, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it's being devastated by hurricane-force storms and winds.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sober glimpse of how the Earth might evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario where Venus began as did Earth, possibly with habitable environments, billions of years ago".
Police have seized "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched in uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and material is being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still straight
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified for a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to video and passed them on to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28th were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many of the Republican Party's state of affairs leading up to next year's election.
It's not clear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the debate sponsors, selected the clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time spent on a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most powerful Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the dial when they heard something comforting: the announcer recorded peaks in approval as candidates talked about tough border approaches.
The toughest and longest exchange of views has been between Rudy Giuliani, the leading candidate nationwide, and Mr. Romney, who has pushed ahead in key early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two fought particularly hard when the questioners asked whether either candidate would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Second-party candidates like Duncan Hunter, congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, congressman from Colorado, were able to put their bit in the mill on this issue.
Neither of them has a chance of getting nominated, but they're both staying in the game, maybe because they started sounding the alarm about immigration earlier and more strongly than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same view: stricter borders, no tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns about the world around them, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contrast between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when other topics came up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he has been a proponent of gun ownership in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were debating whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani has gone so far as to conclude that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the literal story of Jonah and the whale.
Another inquirer asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now, against all odds, the number one in a recent poll in Iowa because of his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to run, thus earning himself a laughingstock.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa is overshadowed by recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul's loud cheering at Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced back from the bottom because the two wings of the party still can't agree on more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincingly with the winning message of American greatness on his lips, blinking at both wings of the party.
This time, the party is split, and the outcome is far from clear.
The Labour pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is a common practice in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills at the Paris hotel mysteriously paid, no extra-marital fingers touched.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would have gotten away with not having it discovered that some wealthy businessman had been masking contributions to the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) for four years under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the poll, there was hope that he would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of the increasingly funny line from the acting Liberal Democrat leader, the once-feared Mr Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The reckless rescue of the troubled Northern Rock Bank has revealed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out tax reform proposals have brought the corporations together against the government.
The loss of personal data on 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative malpractice.
Three retired generals started a revolt in the House of Lords, protesting cuts to military spending, saying that being a commander of the armed forces was a part-time job.
Now, here are the gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and their former watchdog of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for his end.
Yet governments can reach a tipping point where they find governance difficult.
People don't trust politicians, and they don't like them, but they usually shift their distrust when a new party takes over.
Once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to make things better, and may not even be in office for long, this shift is gone: the administration becomes a loophole, ministers start briefing, the press searches for bad news, and the government becomes decentralized and defensive.
In one respect, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, since he cannot take the position of the new brush compared to other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the Treasury records are connected to the decisions Mr. Brown made as Secretary of the Treasury.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in Blair's troubles, such as the lengthy investigation into party funding caused by "value for money", voters can safely assume he was.
Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
The overcrowding isn't as terrible as the conservatives make it.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has been killed or deceived.
And the cure, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, stable, and mildly brutal government.
The recent political donation scandal is a good example.
The garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but it wasn't his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear and they exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might be buying access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams's scheme but did not know it was illegal, will be questioned in detail, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the Labour chief fundraiser who learned about the scurrilous gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these entanglements, even though the bulk of the payments were made after he took office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He was quick to condemn the violation of his own party's laws, but he diluted his resolve by resorting to a well-established instrument, the commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not difficult.
If the law has been broken, it is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of party funding.
That would require the Labour Party, which is in a tight spot, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up its special financial relationship with the unions - a bitter pill for a party loyalist like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives are now well ahead in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to win is with unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis affecting the U.S. credit card market?
When blood is in the water, the dorsal fins naturally begin to move around excitedly.
Now that the U.S. housing market is shrinking, predators have turned their attention to the credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer credit options were infected by subprime mortgages.
The signs of tension are obvious.
The number of cases of non-payment (with more than 30 days' delay) and of accounts written off (accounts considered non-enforceable by the provider) is increasing.
HSBC announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer lending market - also due to nonperforming credit card loans.
It's too early to panic, though.
There's still a lot of unpaid bills and insolvency.
According to Moody's, the 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below the average.
The deterioration rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 change in US personal bankruptcy laws led to a sharp decline in the number of bankruptcy filings, which make up the bulk of credit card losses; thus, the number of filings (and thus the number of write-offs) would increase regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good repayment rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts each month.
And confidence in securities backed by credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their emissions volumes in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are definitely direct routes for the spread of infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when they dry up on loans for real estate, consumers tend to get into credit card debt.
Credit card issuers, however, look more to cash flow than to collateral values, so falling house prices may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of lenders.
They can even be advantageous to lenders.
The incentive for consumers to repay mortgages decreases as the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up the priority list for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more volatile conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or borrowing limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risks of rapid price fluctuations of the warranty items.
"We're not going to have to reassess all our loans overnight", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
While the risk of a subprime-style explosion is low, the risk of a gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry faces a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to stand trial for their roles in a fraudulent scheme linked to former Enron chief executive Andrew Fastow changed their plea to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally denied seven counts of fraud, involving them and Fastow in financial fraud in 2000 -- getting rich off their employers' accounts.
They were due in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein, Jr., each of them confessed to one fraud.
The case of the three former senior executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was front-page news for the two years of the issuance proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of an investigation that began after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron collapse.
The indictment against the bankers -- who have earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraud with Fastow and his former top aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a subsidiary of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a series of Enron scams that propelled Enron into a spiral of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch at zero, but our three British people knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a stake in the bank's branch for $1 million.
The accused bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this subsidiary of Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others adjusted for approximately $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a facility in Texas.
All three British men were free on $1 million bail, which ordered them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the country, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks no longer allowed it to hide billions in debt or report failed speculations as profitable.
The collapse has lost thousands of jobs, over $60 billion in market value and over $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were vacated after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of Russia's rich, it's a small return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers", says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in that many seats, because it's for a close family or a corporate president".
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Fair, which is a four-day orgy of lavish consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers set up stalls, hoping to lure the newly wealthy Russians to everything from mahogany-lined yachts to diamond-lined racks to cars that 50 Cent wouldn't be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stall.
"It's a nice car, but they're against us in fifths and tenths", he said.
"Russia is the second largest private jet market after the United States".
The oil waves are pouring money into the Russian capital just like they did in Dallas' days.
"We passed the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got enormously rich and moved to Europe, where they were looked at as materialists", said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their work on this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference drew Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a combined fortune of $282 billion, according to Forbes magazine's list of the richest people.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a leading local institute, published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, which found that there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, with a combined fortune of $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jeweller David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are well-groomed and men are well-off".
Walking around in their evening gowns on Sunday night in their hats, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova branded themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars and I can't decide between an Infiniti, a Mercedes and a Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who was wearing a red carpet veteran's branded outfit, next to which Joan Rivers looked like a housewife.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the freshly rich, brand-driven Russian shoppers who are willing to sit for hours in road traffic to stroll through a warehouse that is a crisp mix of Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke pool tables, Dubai apartments, Gund stuffed animals and a caravan.
Members of the public could purchase tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue tiles in life-size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in gold".
And indeed, the sellers here say that the Russians with the old money (by Russian standards it's 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known limited edition brands that would never be shown at the shopping fair.
Yet, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries, or tourists, flooded the trade fairs every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, braided with gold thread, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car customizer, said he had sold three chainsaw-style car grids for a Rolls-Royce Phantoma for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for the Russian casino owner, which was to be splattered with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a wheel made of ostrich skin or a portrait of his wife made of cubic zirconia does not have to ride those wheels yet", said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep them in his garage for 30 to 40 cars".
While many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" doesn't mean much of an exclusive nowadays, given the huge increase in property prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more than you think".
Those who aren't millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company erected four red British-style telephone booths filled with a pile of counterfeit bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said that his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaires' Fair.
Passersby stopped to throw a pile of money around, or to have their friends take a picture with their cell phone as they relaxed amidst the surplus wealth, or simply to stuff their pockets with a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey possibly caused by malfunctioning surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of the local restaurant a little more healthy and watched the ambulance arrive at a white New England house two blocks down West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car joined in.
And then another.
"Then I saw the forensic delivery", said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"In that moment, I knew someone had died".
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity police refused to disclose, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine the cause of Miss Arroy's death, and they hope toxicology tests, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help solve the mystery of the death that has sent a wave of grief through the Newark police department.
Ms. Arroy had been an assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and hardworking", Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me".
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroy, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for Union County State's Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are trying to determine if Ms. Arroy died from the effects of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the possibilities", said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
Authorities said they arrived at the house at approximately 3:00 p.m.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, reportedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had interviewed Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with the broken rose bush in the front yard and the Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading into the basement, in the open garage, sat a blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On the hooks on one side were two mountain wheels.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Miss Arroy provided invaluable assistance in teasing him with the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful with this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing".
The hope of the Fed cutting interest rates leads to a strengthening of the world's stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday as market hopes that the Fed would try to ease lending conditions by further cutting interest rates were bolstered by reassuring remarks from the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second only to Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, regulators must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In an apparent effort to calm the agitated markets amid signs of a reviving credit effort, Mr Kohn said that the recent upheavals "partly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets towards the end of September and in October".
It also stated that if the increased instability persists, there is a greater chance that the financial conditions of households and firms will deteriorate further.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to provide additional fresh capital injections into U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid further bad news about the U.S. economy, as home sales in October posted record low numbers.
The effects of the financial panic were underlined by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost-cutting to offset heavy losses caused by a failed bet on substandard housing lending in America.
Only 20 of these positions are expected to be eliminated in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 gained 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 strengthened by 2.3 percent.
Recently, credit tensions in the markets have shown full force after the European Central Bank's three-month money-packages auction lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release above-standard money into London's money markets increased as three-month UK interbank lending rates rose after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to their highest since the end of September at 6.59%.
England must decide, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be number six at bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a wider context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who is holding the post on loan at best, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to help with the decision-making and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the general manager of the England team, is starting to fill with applications for the post of national selector, though not necessarily full-time.
Whoever doesn't get a sixth on the bat is going to be unlucky, but life is often unfair, and sports are not.
It's not easy to find what gets one to the top of their profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just in cricket that the choice is difficult and requires judgment, which in the end always has to be subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to the Shah if it is?
We could ask the same thing in another field, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and industry experience, should be promoted to the board -- there's only one seat.
Who's to say which level is right for a cricketer when he can't get a chance to go down or swim to the next?
Naturally, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the right moment to take the wicket, and a batsman needs regular chances in the starting positions if he ever wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching a picker's gaze is more complicated.
For example, last season, there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and threw like an archer.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs apiece.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at the same modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for the next.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara may be a matter of opinion.
The choice may spark or affect the careers of both, or it may not have much impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every Test and in first-class he gave good performances, five wickets and 40 free runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time was fighting for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who is in addition, although in Australia against Australia he scored twice a hundred, perhaps still underestimated.
It's more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion following today's training at the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
Speaking for Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test turn at 88 in Mumbai and 32 centuries in first-class against six by Bopar, who, at 22, is seven years younger and has an excellent stat against spin bowls.
However, Shah made just ten runs in two innings in May against the Caribbean in a Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, and this, coupled with the immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan wanted to re-sign him for the next match, his kicking seems to have taken something from the momentum that was so evident in Bombay.
But the Essex Universals have the joie de vivre in their bones.
He is not intimidated by anything on the cricket field, and his behavior off the field is symbolic of a recently overturned four-wheel drive car at the show day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He was left with minor injuries and apparently in shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from a distance, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-fast slip shots on the pitches here, which seem to suit him, he delivers effectively and he shoots confidently and skillfully.
Picking the right person is one thing, picking the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea tickets suggest, he's the one who's playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, dropping off refugees who ran out of money or whose visas had expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some even returned to fight the armed militias that had driven them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad", said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the papers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muktada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his men to cease fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni area of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaria called him and told him that the local militia, backed by the US military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who was driven from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Yesterday, some friends called me and told me they were setting up a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and they needed me and my guys to support them.
That's why I came back today", said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the appeal of the calm in the capital after the increased American military presence and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who are armed with the American military to defend their neighborhood.
But they were more concerned about the visa obstruction and the money shortage in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, 51, a father of three, has voiced the suspicion shared by refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis so they could return to Iraq", said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left".
Part of the reason for the easing of violence is the fact that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Saarland, good education
The smallest German state is a leader in vocational education, even excelling in the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
In one area of education alone, Saarland is concerned by the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday, at the age of 50, that we are not French" - this self-deprecating slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal state.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is ranked fifth in the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) education monitoring.
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Today, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple diploma.
This is reflected in the relatively high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, more than the average number of Sara children are admitted to college - many without a high school education.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland", says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
By more than one in five young people gaining admission to a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland offers a wide range of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities for studying two subjects are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Sarrah Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
"After the first Pisa study, we have made several reforms in the general education schools", says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
To help children start learning as early as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model adopted by other federal states.
If the students' results improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
In the Pisa study of 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk fell from 29 to 20%.
Overall, however, the situation in Saarland has not improved as much as in other Länder.
Bavarians can count better.
And to Sarajevo's disappointment, the Pisa study does not compare foreign language proficiency - otherwise, Sarajevo could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in secondary schools - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chavez moves the clock
The hours in Venezuela are about to go differently than the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez will move the clock back in this South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chavez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official Venezuelan newspaper reported that the clock will be moved by minus four and a half hours from the world time according to the new law.
The South American country will be in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by saying, among other things, that the United States had imposed a division of time zones into whole hours.
On Wednesday, local time, Chavez also announced that he was cutting ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage crisis.
This left-wing nationalist declared that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it anymore because of my self-respect", said Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform, which the citizens of the oil-rich country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
This reform would significantly strengthen Chavez's power in the country.
The controversy was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's authority to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe "spit in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, criticizing Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
A new mobile phone call has caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet?) - a phrase that has been downloaded by more than half a million people.
It was uttered by the Spanish king Juan Carlos, who was so angered by the left-wing populist's loud remarks at the recent Ibero-American Summit that he was silenced in this way.
Germans face lower pay in 2007
The forecast is that real wages will fall for German workers this year, despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have given a number of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation, people in employment can realistically expect to receive a lower salary in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The small increase in wages, the increase in value-added taxes and the increase in food and energy prices are to blame", said Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) research institute in Bild.
New burdens may also be imposed on employees in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3,3% by the new year was right and reasonable in this situation.
The Federal Labour Agency should not, however, again be in such trouble that it has to demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspaper of this social democratic politician quoted.
It was revealed on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices has pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3% year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought. The European spacecraft Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that lightning strikes on Venus.
Now the European Venus Express probe has provided evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere, and on Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 35 miles [56 km], writes Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
The theory of primordial matter is that life on Earth could have been created by lightning storms that triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
That was not the case on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, life would be scarce on the surface of Venus, with an atmosphere about 100 times as dense as Earth's, and temperatures sometimes as high as 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it is a twin", said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the ESA mission.
Since no spacecraft have been sent to study Venus exclusively since the early 1990's, the launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 marked a milestone in the planet's exploration.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which were reported in several articles in Nature, did more than emphasize Venus' uniqueness in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously thought", Esa said.
In addition to the already known North Pole vortices, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics, Space and Cosmic Physics.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost as massive as Earth, and at 12,100 kilometers in diameter, it's almost as big.
This planet, known as Dawn or Evening Star, orbits the sun in almost 225 days.
But it spins much slower around its own axis, so a day on Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus' surface temperature is not as high as Earth's, at 460 degrees Celsius and 92 bars, scientists believe that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while on Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party strife over the Dalai Lama's acceptance of the office of Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and is calling for a grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's admission.
"We should not outwardly present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue", Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
He also expressed his understanding of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to host the Dalai Lama in September.
"While I respect cultural differences, I consider human rights to be universal", said Köhler.
The Federal President stressed that while everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, that did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows it too", said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his opposition to the Dalai Lama's acceptance, and has been attacked by coalition forces for doing so.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "perversion" of the coalition's foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's acceptance into the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Pierre Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions showed that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also in Chinese territory, is trying to secede from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that has erupted in France
Street fights with police, gunfire, cars set on fire, Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrest that has erupted in France.
We must do everything to prevent social unrest in Germany from escalating into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior urges.
Barricades were burning, rioters fired shotguns at police, and after serious youth unrest in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) feared a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful that we do not create social tensions that escalate into violence.
We have to take it seriously", he told the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with the rapidly changing social reality.
The federal government, the states and the municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, said Schäuble.
Which is not just about integrating migrants.
"Since the integration summit, after the conference on Islam, we have seen the first successes".
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
Last night, youths and police engaged in violent street fighting in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were burned in Toulouse.
The mayor of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater integration efforts from the German government.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "mimic effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
But still, we should negotiate.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average".
First of all, it is necessary to ensure more study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We must give hope to the youth".
The Turkish mayor added that, unlike France, there is more social control of families in Germany.
Moreover, many youths from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
"But we must be careful", Kolat urged.
We must enable young people to "get into work and education quickly".
Meanwhile, the night remained mostly quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed, and a helicopter with flashlights flew over the area.
Authorities reported three arrests and several trash cans and cars torched.
As of yesterday, there are approximately 1,000 law enforcement officers on duty.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
In the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured.
The following night, Toulouse was gripped by unrest.
The riots were sparked by a car accident on Sunday that killed two teenagers.
According to preliminary findings from the state's attorney's office, the police have no responsibility for the deaths of the minors.
In the realm of the Cloud Angels
The Chancellor's remote outreach to reality documents that the coalition is programmatically at an end and that we can't expect anything more from it either.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her dismal, indifferent-sounding and poorly-content speech at the general debate in the Bundestag, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should be running after all.
When she was told she was too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel replied with a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, showing she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
She's shown everyone in the House how much she deserves the reprimand.
Merkel didn't seem to have any real interest, let alone any sense of the problems in the country.
Instead, she presented herself as Angela "Cloud": a politician who stands out from the crowd, who runs away into foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it is constantly praising the conclusions of the Heiligendam summit, but it no longer says how these climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And, by the way, such a car-crowd - such a lack of modesty would have been forgiven by the CDU president two years ago.
Now she's restricted herself to empty phrases that might increase her popularity among people.
This approach damages her image as a pragmatist who doesn't need to be flattered because she solves problems.
But in the realm of the Cloud Angels, domestic political problems are a peripheral matter.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
She has a few extra sentences left on these topics.
It is noteworthy how often Merkel overstates the child benefit.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning to get at least partly correct.
Once things get too concrete, he stumbles into a completely foreign terrain.
The attack unit.
The Republican presidential debate on YouTube has turned into a heated debate in the case of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorites - and both now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is evident from the first issue.
Mitt Romney is pitching his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he's made New York City a "sanctuary for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp reproaches: "I think his own house was just one of those places", he replies, and he tells the former governor of Massachusetts that he privately employed undocumented immigrants.
With no clear favorite on the Republican ticket, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos, recorded by Internet users and uploaded to YouTube, serve only as such clues to a key topic.
"It was precisely this policy of isolationism that allowed Hitler to seize power", John McCain tells his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one pushing for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain has no qualms about Romney's refusal to condemn the torturous interrogation method called "Waterboarding", which simulates heating.
Public reaction in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that the campaign's major themes are neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture.
The audience cheers whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
It'll show where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong then", Romney explains, cringing, asking the party base and the television audience to forgive him for back in 1994 for being pro-abortion.
Giuliani is embarrassed when asked to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian life
The day after he resigned as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Pakistan's ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Parvez Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday, and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and to work for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as Supreme Commander of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, a former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By stepping down as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf has fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to the Attorney General, Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after taking the oath of office, thus fulfilling further demands from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which appointed Musharraf with loyal lawyers after the declaration of a state of emergency in early November, last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The father of the Krautrock is back
The famous German band of the '70s is playing again, the three members of the band Harmonia, at a concert in Berlin, again grabbing their electronic synthesizers.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already considerably more famous abroad.
The sensation is then announced by the appearance of three gentlemen who at first appear to be enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box in front of them, cables and, most importantly, buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, in a snow-white shirt, is sitting in the middle.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, holding a laptop and a guitar.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is leaning over the synthesizers, is seen from the audience's point of view on the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by accident, they become a traditional composition.
The gentlemen musicians seem to be fine with it.
The revival of the band Harmonia caused quite a stir amongst the Krautrock fans.
One thing is worth noting here, and repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of the collective consciousness of pop, it is certainly not so old-fashioned that someone would miss this band painfully for 23 years.
But why shouldn't the German celebrate his still-living legend from the '70s?
Especially when the style of music, mistakenly called krautrock, is valued more in England and America than in your own country.
When the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne group Can with the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2003, the room was filled with the inquisitive gazes of German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience's amazement was boundless.
Michael Rother would later sit on stage with them at Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia is unnecessarily overwhelming, this trio existed for only two years and even then was far from having the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They first performed in the basement of the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a church-run record company.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but he only gained fame as the guitarist for Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile in the Forest in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who had fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as they did in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to pet as a nanny.
It was more like living in some kind of Spitzweig artistic being.
The name for the art is said to derive from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing group, whose badge was reportedly found in a garbage can.
Harmony kept a lot of it.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next one was "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band was suffering from financial difficulties.
The gathering of the grass was not only for self-knowledge.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was reportedly cut at a concert in Griessem in front of a record-setting small audience of barely 50 people.
Rothera had expressed a wish that the members of Harmony would have a show and occasionally practice.
To Roedlia and Moebius, it was a most indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their break-up.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
Cluster was revived in the '80s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griesemer.
His record company Grönland set out to preserve krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Kapela Neu! was considered Roedel's solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Culture.
The Woldtronics Festival performance will be publicly sponsored.
There will be a Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk and author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
Also attending is the founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This is a map of the overall extent of Krautrock's influence on the future of pop music.
The empty space of the famous band will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Ann's line, accompanied by the most bizarre sounds, is floating through the room: "Unique true music, it's the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in the farmer's meeting.
The legend is also fueled by the projection of other black-and-white photographs, with a set of instruments wildly interconnected by cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
No more gluing microphones to organs and drums to extract the never-before-heard home-made tones from instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three of them are technically a punter.
The choir of the House of World Culture doesn't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they whisper under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place they chant emphatically "Aaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk), or in escaping from artistic and social conventions (Cluster) rather than in blues.
Whoever shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia is not going to be disturbed even now.
Even the most obvious things are thought through on stage.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question either makes a person nervous or allows him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convincing.
The screening of the films either places too much emphasis on action and shooting or is too emotional.
That's not gonna stop an actor like Richard Gere at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: war criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the grim background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately, we've lost sight of this most beautiful man of the '80s, not only because he played many cute, unimportant roles in cool female movies, but in conjunction with his press conferences perpetually on the theme of Buddhism, one gets a taste for another movie with this actor.
And yet, Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party.
Gere performs a magical performance, and his war correspondent Simon Hunt is basically what Gere might have become had fate and the film industry not been so merciful: a man who may have had his best years long ago, but like a wreckage-like monument he still retains a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also hits theaters this week, is just the continuation of an endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
We can do a short process with Mörderischer Frieden: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and then one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not portrayed as the cause of all evil, this television shallow film is turning too soon into a shooting and action.
The movie is going to be a lot like Cobra 11, with no highway, but with war.
The Hunting Party is a vivid exploration of why the Balkan War has never been made into a really good movie.
The story of three American war reporters posing as a "fox", a Serbian war criminal, could have become a new "Apocalypse" at another time and under a different director and writer (both Richard Shepard here).
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something the military can't do, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons The Hunting Party failed is that Simon Hunt is not the rambunctious, sentimental cynic portrayed at the beginning.
On the contrary, the template also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be finally written off after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film do what NATO, the CIA and all the world's criminal hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch the criminal and leave him to the just vengeance of the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it's worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
And yet, this film has a deeply human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (who are unified here) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women think of Brecht's famous poem.
It's about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, noting how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like The Hunting Party feature exactly those kind of puffy heads, but they do suggest how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, these papers have said that all Hollywood movies about Iraq have been big failures.
To this one thing we can add: No good film has ever been made about South Africa.
It's almost always true: when a star wanders through a crisis zone or walks through a minefield, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Frontiers of the Fault with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio is made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have taken decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust, Schindler's List.
Many films must be seen - films that are now considered Vietnamese classics - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse", or "The Tin Vest" - were not celebrated as masterpieces at all.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home is instantly on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers don't have the skill needed to tell a flawless story.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be good to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to develop a sarcastically measured artistic vision like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said: "The only similarity is that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust receives criticism for his abandonment of the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from the Hamburg Summer Olympics has been met with sharp criticism from politics and economics.
Many want to continue the fight to hold the water games.
But von Beust is encouraging realism in the estimation of chances.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief negotiator of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described the decision as "unfortunate from a business point of view".
No other project has recently aroused such a great deal of motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm at such a high level".
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a changed timetable".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stuck to his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic bid", von Beust told the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that in early December the Sports Federation will decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means that with a timetable of 2028 we have no realistic chance".
Yet this dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) has called von Beust's comments regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to host the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to ruin our chances by marking plans as buried at this early stage", HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
To renounce the nomination would be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate, which he made at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the University in 2015 as a substitute for hosting the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg College Athletic Association just last week nominated a candidate city.
The SPD group in the Hamburg Senate has complained that it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build housing in Hamburg.
"Development in the Klein Grasbrook area has been held back by the Senate for years because it has bet on the Olympics and excluded housing", said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Klein Grasbrook still planned the Olympics with the whole area later being used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The omission of the 2012 Summer Olympics caused a great deal of excitement in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, was wrecked in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol boxes.
Whoever combines the words Sweden and wooden boxes is not thinking of Andy Warhol, but of Ike.
Or is it?
The wooden boxes currently made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's list of works.
Most of his list of 94 Stockholm-type "Brillo boxes" are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo boxes" a few months ago, an internal investigation by the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has come up with a disappointing result: six "Brillo boxes" donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most of the other Stockholm-style "Brillo boxes" in circulation on the international art market.
The events that precede are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-white design of Brillo's paper soap powder boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes, which were not supplied by Warhol for financial reasons, but were supplied directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about the artwork, it was about the exhibits, just the exhibits.
Warhol also apparently gave permission in 1968 for several wooden Brillo boxes to be made in Sweden, but these are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of 15 boxes that went down in art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" labeled Type Stockholm.
Some of them have been auctioned off for over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred boxes were made and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were only produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg in 1990.
By then, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the head curator of the Moderna Museet, examined three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood panels were painted with base paint and brushed, were painted with oil white.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies showed that the paint was applied by a painter's roll directly to the polishing plate without prior basic painting - and it is acrylic, not oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list", Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve was quoted as saying: "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches a different conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as 'copy material.'"
Back in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "primary allegations" made in the case of the soapbox.
But the organization has remained relentlessly silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered, and they have fortified a hotel in Manila, demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Rebel leader Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the president of election manipulation and corruption, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had earlier attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to flee with some 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to be guarding him apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Government loyalist units have sealed off the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales has condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People are sick of it", said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, the former commander of the elite Scout Rangers unit said that other military units will join the march shortly.
Critics of the government have called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been blamed for corruption for months.
The Manila Financial District has been the main scene of a rebellion of some 200 soldiers against Arroy since 2003.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the uprising collapsed in less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has acquired more than 20% of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company reported on Wednesday that the average price per share is EUR 14.46.
The company now owns 20,05% of the share capital.
There was speculation about a takeover.
The company still considers the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet announced that it was seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market by this step.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by a further 5% to 15,1%, speculation about entry emerged on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this financial institution holds shares only for third parties.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put up for sale a further 17,4 million new shares worth EUR 106,4 million.
Of which, 5,15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for EUR 31,4 million.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL and mobile network products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", a spokesman for United Internet explained.
In order to take over the competitor Freenet, the companies have jointly set up the SME Joint Undertaking.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies are satisfied with a stake of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and will not exercise their right to acquire the other 18.49% of the business.
It is considered that the companies are keeping all options open for the time being, in particular the possibility of further increasing their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-transparent Freenet game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2,9 million mobile subscribers and 1,27 million customers with full or DSL connections at the end of the third quarter.
United Internet Holding and Drillische have so far held a 6,01% stake in Freenet.
It is now agreed that Drillisch will acquire approximately a further 4%.
The right to buy 18,49% of Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
