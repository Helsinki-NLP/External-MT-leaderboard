How long have these symptoms lasted for?
And especially considering your age, all chest pains should be treated in this way
and accompanied by fever.
It is also necessary to check your cholesterol and blood pressure.
And you have a fever now?
And do you still have chest pains?
And in addition, do you have difficulty breathing?
And can you tell me, besides this problem, what other symptoms do you have?
And then how high were you then?
I'm also a bit of a cough.
And I have a slight cold and cough.
And today I have a really bad pain in my chest.
And is now the time for your seasonal sensitivity?
And the chest pain started.
I think I have a little fever and I think I'm going to be sick.
And I want you to explain where the cage chest hurts.
And they also have a high temperature.
and considering your diabetes history
And I feel like my chest is being crushed.
And people are always coughing in my face.
And you have chest pain.
And you said, "This is pressure that's going to get into your chest".
Someone in the family has heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Along with these muscle pains, have you noticed any other symptoms or problems?
Are there other patients in your household who have the same symptoms as you?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you short of breath right now?
Do you still have a painful sensation in your chest?
It's flu season now because it's flu season.
We should also not be indifferent to chest pains that have a heart origin.
But the bigger problem right now, is the same chest pain.
I have trouble breathing, though.
But I know a lot of people who cough in my face.
But we must take any chest pain with the utmost seriousness.
But right now you're breathing well, right?
Because of this chest pain, I completely forgot.
Do you feel like someone is pressing on your chest?
Do you still feel like you have shortness of breath?
Are they also sick and have similar symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic conditions such as high blood pressure or something similar?
Do you have any medical problems or other chronic illnesses such as diabetes?
Do you have chest pain, shortness of breath, along with this chest pain?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have a certain amount of mental strain along with it?
Do you know what his symptoms were?
Do you see this picture?
Drink a lot of fluids today.
I'm still going to get tested for diabetes though.
However, his symptoms are quite similar to those of his.
So how tall are you?
How's your blood pressure?
If your severe fever persists.
Then if you have a limit of one hundred and two degrees or higher
If you think your symptoms or problems are related to a better condition
I had a fever the other day.
I also had a snack at the time.
I had a fever the other day.
I'm here in my chest, in excruciating pain.
I also have some difficulty breathing.
I'll send you a picture of it
I'm having some chest pain today.
Just today I had a little headache and fever.
The look of the flu is also very similar.
It looks like a mild flu.
Is it like having a very heavy person sitting on your chest?
It all started with a headache and almost immediately accompanied by a fever.
In the middle of the cage my chest hurts.
The pain is like pressure in the chest.
In the chest of my mother's chest is 
In the middle of my mother's chest cage is 
In the middle of the chest is a chest.
I was in a chest cage and had pain in my chest.
I'm so worried about this chest pain.
I would like you to describe this chest pain for me
Such as high blood pressure or diabetes
It's like it's right in the middle of your chest.
Now for that you can take one tablet of Tachipirina
Now, Mary, tell me how many days you've had these symptoms.
Now you said you had chest pain in the shelf.
At times, I feel a bit of chest pain.
Well, besides pain, do you have any other symptoms that go along with it?
Feel someone sitting on a shelf or in your chest?
It is also accompanied by fever and cough, headaches and muscle pains almost 
Right in the middle of my mother's chest.
In this picture, I want you to mark where the pain is feeling.
Then you'd have to say 
So do you think that some of these symptoms could be related to being pregnant?
So your children have the same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain.
At night, it is then most often worn
I had that two days ago.
Last night, it started to increase.
This is Dr. Porter at the Emergency Triage Center.
So can you give me more details about your chest pain?
Well I'm in front of my body, here in my chest I feel pain

A rapidly spreading cluster outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing prevalence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Economic Area/EU and the UK confirms while in different countries, we are in different stages of the pandemic but the COVID-19 pandemic in all countries is progressing rapidly.
Based on the experience of Italy, other countries, hospitals and intensive care units must increase their preparedness for the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who require healthcare and special intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported this causative agent as a novel coronavirus type called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these cases improve.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more severe illness that requires hospitalization while the remaining 6% experience a critical condition that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends of the increasing spread of the coronavirus in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 virus cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, with the number in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of the COVID-19 virus in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread to more geographic areas and the dynamics of the pandemic in other parts of the world are now following the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues reported in the journal Eurosurveillance on 5 March 2020 the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe based on the definition of the World Health Organization.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed cases by France on 24 January 2020 were reported from people who had returned from Wuhan in China's Hubei province.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been identified in all 30 European/EEA countries and England (UK) according to which as of 31 December 2019 to date, 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths were reported of which 17,750 confirmed cases and 1,441 deaths had been reported from Italy alone.
To achieve cumulative numbers and cumulative outbreaks of COVID-19 cases 
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 cases in various countries around the world are only obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organisation and the World Health Organisation, which are updated every day at 08:00 am.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare it to the trend of disease in Italy.
As an indicator for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative prevalence rate of COVID-19 cases over a 14-day period and as a result considered the normal COVID-19 period in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative number of cases reported by each country on 15 March 2020 at 08:00 a.m. was also compared with the number of cases reported in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day aggregate outbreak trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK is generally tracked from Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, cumulative COVID-19 outbreaks began to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (additional claims).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar upward trend of cumulative COVID-19 outbreaks (supplementary claims).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This figure shows that on 15 March at 8am, the total number of cases reported in the 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in the three weeks before or less.
The results indicate that the number of diagnosed cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak suggest that this pandemic is currently progressing at almost the same pace in all countries.
While countries are at different stages of the disease, the response of public health organizations is variable and there are likely to be different definitions and protocols in countries for selecting patients who should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including increasing the speed of testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the virus-affected areas of Italy described a situation in which about 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had reached their maximum capacity.
Information on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospital or intensive care unit is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data are not marked).
To complement the current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths, this information needs to be collected in a systematic manner.
A study conducted during the years 2010-11 found that access to intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe is highly variable, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
That is, countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and medium care per 100,000 population in 2010-11) 
Modelling scenarios for saturation of healthcare capacity, with a view to meeting the requirements for different EU/EEA countries and the UK in terms of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital in connection with the occupation of more than 90% of the capacity of intensive care beds, are presented in the sixth updated ECDC COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since cases of illness are categorised in specific regions of European/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a region, information on cases of illness as well as intensive care beds should preferably be available in the list of territorial units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and the ongoing trend in other countries suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is progressing rapidly.
Hospitals and intensive care units must therefore prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care healthcare, such as the situation in the affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent Rapid Risk Assessment of the ECDC, a rapid, preventive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a rapid shift from a containment approach to mitigation, is needed, as predicting a rapid increase in the number of infections if not done too soon may cause decision-makers and hospitals to lack sufficient time to understand, adopt and adapt their response based on this trend.
A rapid risk assessment lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of this pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity for the remaining countries to step up their control measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the healthcare sector.
Failure to do so will likely leave the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries facing a wave of patients who will require intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has so far led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people and the infection of 80,000 in China and other regions of the world, which is a catastrophe for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2 also, like its own similar virus, SARS, which infected thousands of people in 2003, may have been transmitted from bats and, through a similar mechanism, cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
This paper, in response to a large number of published articles on this emerging disease, seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the basic principles of epidemiology, causology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
Although many questions still need to be answered, I hope this review article will help us understand and eradicate this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who, due to the outbreak of a new viral disease, were forced to stay at home for the entire holiday and several weeks afterwards.
It is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was also named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is the number one enemy of the population and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020 in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, causology, diagnosis and treatment have been published that have identified the sequence of the virus isolated from the body of a few patients.
In this review article, we seek to summarize the research progress in this new and rapidly developing subject area.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, which was discovered in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in relation to the prevention and treatment of this disease, as well as some other important questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly leading to about 15% of minor colds.
But in this century, twice we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other countries with horrific epidemic rates and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin was first reported to the National Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was transmitted.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was reported from Wuhan.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the healthcare sector's medical personnel disruption was reported, indicating that human-to-human transmission is possible.
On January 23, residents of Wuhan City were placed under home quarantine and public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, in the first clinical study of the disease, it was reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
The World Health Organization on January 30 declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
Because the situation is changing rapidly, the ultimate extent and severity of the disease outbreak remains a matter to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study conducted in several centers on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 showed Rosentry's picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People infected with SARS-CoV-2 have different ages, but are mainly between 30 and 65 years old.
Almost half of the infected people (47.7 percent) were over 50 years old, a very small number were under 20 years old and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
People infected with SARS-CoV-2 are mostly male (0.31/100,000) to female (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in various clusters mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
The period from onset to diagnosis of COVID-19 was an average of 5 days (2-9 days).
The median duration of the disease was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The period from onset to death was an average of 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base syrup number (R0) was equal to 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people with the disease increased significantly before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to the busy transportation time, before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 include gender (men), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a unique strand of sensitive RNA.
These viruses can be divided into four classes alpha, beta, gamma and delta, with identified alpha and beta variants of CoVs that can infect humans.
Spinal envelope glycoprotein (S) attaches to the host cell angiotensin and is converted to ACE2 (ACE2) and DPP4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA genome of the virus is released in the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is replicated, the RNA genome with enveloped glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicle-containing sacs which then attach to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
With a genetic match of more than 99/98% in 10 sample sequences collected from the original outbreak site i.e. the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, it was determined that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through examination with an intermediate electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the superficial part of the thin tissue lining human airways.
It was determined that human ACE2 acts as a carrier for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes fewer infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 could also constitute a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis by inhibiting the occurrence of IFNβ. however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the structure of a human full-length human ACE2-related EM-cryogen with a resolution of 2.9 angstroms in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which had open and encased faces, was synthesized as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind two S proteins together which could be evidence for identifying CoVs and infections.
B0AT1 could be converted into a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Medium originally created and hosted by Medium
It is known that the origin of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which originated from bats, were transmitted to humans through the seahorse and camel, respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, it was determined that bats are native hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs whose origins are from the bat SL-CoVZX45 and the bat SL-CoVZX21.
However, the question of what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unanswered and the route of transmission still needs further clarification.
J and colleagues believe that snakes that contain the homologous compound within the S protein have acted as carriers of the virus from bats to humans.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou China based on a 99 percent genetic homology in CoVs detected in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2, announced that perhaps eating pangolins - a type of long-hose ant-eater often used in traditional Chinese medicine - has acted as a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference spread across two genomes is still a large difference; so we are still waiting for definitive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and a humidity of 40 to 50 percent for up to 5 days under laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and a temperature of 56°C for 30 minutes, ethanol 75%, chlorine-containing disinfectants, plastic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine, which can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this novel virus.
A detailed study of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported at this time.
In this order, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
Generally, after a virus attacks a host cell, virus recognition is initially performed by the host's personal immune system through analogue diagnostic receptors (PRRs) including sublectin type C receptors, sub-toll receptors (TLRs), sub-NOD receptors (NLRs), and sub-RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
The virus through various pathways causes the emergence of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of interferon-type (IFN) which leads to limiting the spread of the virus and accelerating the macrophage phagocytosis in the anti-virus gene.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV may help the virus escape from the immune system.
The adaptive immune system will soon be able to fight the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Helper T cells are activated to help defend the cells by producing pre-inflammatory cytokines.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential in the fight against viral infections.
An antibody isolated from a recovered patient, for example, causes the MERS-CoV to be neutralized.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system leads to the production of a large number of free radicals in a local form that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst case scenario lead to disability of several organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by its cluster appearance, mostly affects older individuals with underlying diseases and pregnant women.
A common theme is that people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or have a weakened immune system are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of 425 first cases in Wuhan, the median SARS-CoV-2 infection period was determined to be equal to 14-1 days but in most cases lasts 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period is on average 3 days, with a time interval of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study shows, as explained above, that the incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days) which is based on a statistical analysis of 8,866 cases.
This is crucial for health authorities to be able to determine the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of inactivity, thereby preventing the transmission of the virus from infected individuals who do not have symptoms to others.
A common method is that people who have been exposed to the virus or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Then in most cases the main and primary symptom is COVID-19, which can be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath or decreased oxygenation in the tissues a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progresses rapidly toward the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification and blood clotting disorder.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries in radiological images should be screened for early virus diagnosis.
A population study in late December 2019 showed the following percentage of symptoms: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required a ventilator.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a familial cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from one asymptomatic individual.
A population study conducted in 2012 showed that in patients with MERS-CoV fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) were also seen as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilators, which is much more than COVID-19 patients, indicating that MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, it has been shown that fever (99-100 percent), dry cough (29-75 percent), shortness of breath (40-42 percent), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and in about 20%-14% of patients ventilators were required.
By February 14, when the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576, the COVID-19 mortality rate was around 2%.
In comparison, the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002 was about 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
Based on a population study in June 2012, the mortality rate for MERS was calculated at 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
One previous study previously showed that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 6.47 and its 95% confidence interval (CI) is around 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 are presented in Table 1.1.
The above images show that SARS-CoV-2 has greater potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of spread, but the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 is lower than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
In this order, the control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is much more severe than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
A cluster start often occurs in a family or from a gathering place or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often had two weeks prior to the onset of the disease, a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with infected persons or patients.
However, it has been reported that individuals can be carriers of the virus for more than two weeks without having symptoms, and patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital can also re-transmit the virus, which is a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is within normal or low.
For example, a condition of lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L, including a lymphocyte count of less than 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and the presence of the virus in the blood were observed in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of hepato-muscular enzymes and myoglobin in the blood were elevated in some patients, and C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition in most patients were elevated.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer D, which results from the breakdown of fibrin present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Abnormalities seen on chest x-ray images are seen in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-sided shadows of fragmentation or broken glass in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are developed.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and advanced fibrosis severely jeopardize an individual's air exchange.
Type I and II dysfunction in the pneumocyte leads to decreased surfactant levels and increased surface tension resulting in reduced lung dilation ability and increased risk of lung failure.
So the worse the chest radiography findings, the more severe the extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the pneumocyte shell, glass membrane formation and penetration of interstitial lymphocytes and multiple sinus cells in the lungs of the patient who died due to the disease were compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of RNA associated with SARS-CoV-2 by means of the reverse polymerase-rhonovision chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main diagnostic criteria for COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate of this method, which may accelerate the epidemic, on February 13, 2020, the use of clinical symptoms (which no longer relied solely on RT-PCR) for diagnosis of disease in China began.
A similar situation had occurred for the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and mandatory to have an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group proposed a protocol using CRISPR-based Sherlock methods to identify SARS-CoV-2, which allows the detection of composite RNA fragments related to SARS-CoV-2 from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter of incoming cases) which is done using a single strip in less than an hour without the need for precision expensive tools.
There is hope that the new method, if confirmed in clinical samples, could be used dramatically to increase accuracy and convenience in testing.
Given the lack of experience with this new strain of CoV, doctors can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while various therapies used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases have been proposed (Table 2.2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma received from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Recovered plasma from recovered patients was even proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and likely has weaker attacks on other organs that have ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
As such, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the most important risk factors in low-risk patients and the leading cause of death in people.
Therefore, respiratory support to relieve symptoms is vital and can save the life of an individual if the severity of the disease can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilator and mechanical ventilator.
Patients who have severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extra-bronchial membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified bioreflex cardiovascular technique used to treat heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock and protection of vital organ function are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been determined that cytokine storm is caused by immune system overreaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytocin storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
This cytokine causes immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Suppression of the immune system is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients who have a chronic condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other therapies for immune system suppression in order to prevent cytokine storm include T cell-directed modulation of immune response; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibitor; JAK inhibitor; Blenatumum; cytokine 4 symptom-sending suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immune system suppressant drugs were widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, the use of steroids in high doses in the case of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19 was not helpful.
It may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis and dramatically affect the recovery of the disease.
As such, short-term use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses is recommended to be used with caution for COVID-19 patients who are in a critical condition.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy for the disease has been approved.
However, it has been determined that intravenous intervention with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat illnesses caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequently, possible inhibition of other RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses by remdesivir was identified.
Accordingly, Gilead has sent the compound to China for a series of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results have been very promising.
In addition baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions of this therapy with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma receptors from patients who have recovered and produced antibodies
Taking blood from patients who have recovered from a disease and disease in order to use it to help treat other patients suffering from a similar disease or to protect healthy people from contracting that disease has a long history.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood to fight off the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and detect and directly neutralize unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 was detected and injected into 10 patients with diarrhea.
Their disease symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, before specific treatments can be offered, the use of this method on a large scale requires validation and transparency.
In addition, in view of therapeutic effects, some drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antigen in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma for the treatment of patients is very high.
And it is difficult to rapidly produce a specific antigen that is sufficient to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic codes encoding the antibodies or screening for effective antibodies against the original virus proteins is more important and useful.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments in China.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of different ingredients in the formula which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its effective ingredients are still unknown or unclear, because extracting and confirming these ingredients or their optimal combination is difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the important therapeutic approaches for patients with mild symptoms or patients with moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of cure in COVID-19 patients were observed in several Chinese provinces where TCM was used for 87% of patients, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%). In Hubei Province where only 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the lowest rates of cure (13%) were observed.
However, this comparison is not entirely accurate, as many factors such as the number and severity of patients must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Therapy (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM therapies.
They found that the time required for body temperature to recover, symptoms to disappear and bed rest in the group treated with WM+TCM was significantly shorter than in the group treated with WM alone.
Even more surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still awaiting better controlled trials on larger scales and in more centers.
Also, determining the mechanism of action and identifying the effective components of TCM therapies or their combinations if possible, is subjective and has aroused the curiosity of scientists.
Suspected patients or confirmed COVID-19 cases often have a great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of this infection such as fever, hypoxia (lack of oxygen in higher body tissues), cough and side effects of treatment such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can lead to increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stage of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric symptoms including severe depression, anxiety, nerve attacks, psycho-motor excitements, psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and even suicide have been reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health system's approach to countering the COVID-19 virus outbreak, can make individuals anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine and disrepute among their family and friends.
Therefore, psychotherapy care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, persons in contact with them as well as the general population in need.
Psychosocial support should include the creation of mental health teams from various disciplines, transparent communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and apps to prevent close contact.
Effective vaccines are necessary to break the chain of transmission from the herd population and infected humans to ready hosts and are often used as a complementary method to antiviral therapy in controlling infectious diseases caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on S protein to produce strong and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Weakened live vaccines in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in healthy individuals and severe-disease models and their protection against human-animal viral infections must be determined before a clinical study can begin.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, scattered cases and outbreaks of MERS in the Middle East continue to be seen and, due to the presence of animal-to-human transmission sources in native areas, spread to other regions.
Vaccination strategies for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral carriers, nanoparticles, quasi-viral particles and protein subunits of the neutreceptor have been proposed and some of them have been evaluated in animal models.
Producing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unsafe individuals is an essential and vital task for epidemic control.
However, overcoming this difficulty is difficult due to the long time required to produce a vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic changes of different CoV species.
COVID-19 as a novel disease has begun to mark the full clinical course among thousands of newly diagnosed patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without the appearance of complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 virus has also been associated with high complications and mortality in patients with acute cases.
Therefore, creating a model that predicts disease flow is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited possibilities.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect the prediction of the course of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important predictor of SARS outbreaks, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in people aged 30 to 65 years; a study of 8,866 patients found that 47.4% of patients were over 50 years old.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have congenital complications and abnormalities and were older than those not requiring intensive care (mean age of group 1 was 66 and the average age of group 2 was 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor in the course of disease and determining outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 as opposed to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Previous illnesses and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care were more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiovascular events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive collagenic cells and lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and hereditary diseases are strongly interrelated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Blood levels of reactive protein C indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been suggested as a potential factor for disease, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
A correlation of CRP levels with the severity and prediction of the course of COVID-19 disease has also been suggested.
In addition to this increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help in predicting outcomes.
Enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in tissue damage.
Therefore, as traditional symptoms, heart or liver disorders may be present.
Main clinical symptoms: To predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19, chest radiography and the timing of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immune system suppressors that are commonly used as a therapeutic approach for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many individuals recovering from vascular atherosclerosis suffer from lifelong disability and reduced quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used at low doses and for a short period in COVID-19 patients.
Psychological stress: As explained above, since the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered from extreme stress, as they often have been in quarantine for long periods of time and have experienced severe insecurity and witnessed the death of close family members and roommates.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover and relieve stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies that have been conducted so far, it appears that the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 differ from those of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition to multiplying in the lower respiratory tract can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and in the early stage of infection, has mild or mild symptoms and is similar to other CoVs that cause a mild cold.
Therefore, patients with early stage or nephthal phase disease can produce large amounts of viruses during daily activities, which can make it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were seriously ill and in the early stages of the disease, transmission did not occur.
As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe than the SARS outbreak and is more difficult to control.
Many efforts are currently underway in China, including an outdoor curfew in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of breaking the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, which indicates a slowdown in the disease.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will be over by March and the viral descent phase will continue for another 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be essentially more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues, based on a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic, believe that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in swabs of the nasal cavity and throat swabs of patients who had been discharged from hospital two weeks earlier and recovered, suggesting that the newly identified virus could turn into a cyclical illness similar to influenza.
However, there have been promising signs in China based on a decline in the number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to infect one million people and kill half a million.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become weaker pathogenic and eventually mutate into a parasite or a low pathogenic virus that lives alongside humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and is likely transmitted through direct contact with materials infected with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which provides the possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A new study of 138 cases reported that 41 percent of infections occurred as a result of hospital infections involving 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health care workers.
Therefore, great care must be taken in protecting humans, especially health care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers-by who come into contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of contamination is wearing a face mask; which can be both through the use of surgical masks and N95 (Series 1860) respiratory masks that help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the passage of liquid droplets dispersed by potentially infected individuals through the air or adhering to the surface of the material where they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series 1860) can protect an individual from inhaling viral particles between 10 and 80 nanometers in size and only 5 percent of viral particles can completely penetrate it; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nanometers.
Since particles can pass even through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, healthcare personnel who are in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (Series 1860), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers must wear isolation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus after wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare personnel should also use transparent shields and glasses when working with patients.
For the general population in infected or potentially infected areas, it is highly recommended that individuals wash their hands more than usual with disinfectant soaps and try to stay at home and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
A distance of three feet (one meter) is considered the appropriate distance for people who want to stay away from the patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the human world as a novel virus, its close affinity with SARS-CoV, which was reported on January 7, 2020 based on deep memories that a SARS outbreak existed in 2003, was an important warning to China.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens by saying that the new virus is low in contagiousness, its human-to-human transmission is limited, and that there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message significantly reduced the awareness of the danger among the general public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and a crucial time to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan was lost.
The disease control agencies in China may have learned the hard lesson from this and make fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be more vigilant, considering that (1) every word said by health organizations is important to citizens and can change people's attitudes and decisions; (2) instead of waiting for official reports from doctors and authorities, they should be much more sensitive to and react to unusual information received from clinics; (3) instead of trying to reassure people, they should take more restrictive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages; and (4) in order to increase public awareness of pandemic diseases and improve the community response system periodically, they should make targeted and effective routines for regular testing.
The outbreak of COVID-19 disease was started by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 in late December 2019.
In less than two months at the time of writing this, the virus has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS resurgence.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that recognition of them is essential for curbing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more often than younger people and men more often than women, and its severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than younger people.
SARS's mortality rate was higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS transmit the virus when they were seriously ill, making it harder to contain COVID-19 than SARS.
This topic partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A normal RNA test in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can become infected with the virus again and their test result is positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
In view of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain unresolved, as outlined below:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is approximately 96% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS CoVs like bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
Which animal, as a medium, transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off transmission and the outbreak of disease can at any time be delayed.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical measurements have determined that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent disease-dependent changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-containing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long does the outbreak last?
During human-to-human transmission, how does the virus genetically mutate?
Will this disease turn into a worldwide pandemic, like SARS, recurring sporadically or in a periodic form like influenza?
The answers to the above questions are important but it may take some time to answer the above questions and many more questions to draw.
However, at whatever cost it may be necessary, we have no choice but to end this pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
The animal origin of the human corona virus is 
For thousands of years, adaptation and adaptation have allowed the simultaneous evolution of the coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The emergence of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), on the other hand, has highlighted how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019, brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmission rate, but the symptoms of the disease were less severe compared to the severity of SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a type of disease shared between humans and animals and identifying the animal origin of HCoVs is a good help.
The origin of most HCoVs are bats, which do not cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that act as intermediate storage for some HCoVs have also been identified.
Animal hosts have a direct impact on the prevention of disease in humans.
Studies of host CoV interactions in animals could also provide important insights into the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we provide a review of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
An important topic that I will be addressing is the comparison of different HCoVs from the point of view of viral evolution and genetic neutrequebris.
The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is being discussed in this context.
In addition, the necessity of successful host mutation and viral evolution for disease severity is examined in this paper.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped viruses with positive polarity and RNA-stranded.
These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes among RNA viruses, were named "CoV", which is because of the crown-like morphology they have under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs are genome-integrated that share a similar structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two adult recessive recessive recessive frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are converted to polyprotein replicases pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing and results in the production of 16 non-structural proteins named nsp1 to 16.
The remaining part of the genome includes ORF, which is used for structural proteins such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproponin (N).
A number of ancestor-specific secondary proteins have been encoded by ancestors of different CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the genus beta-CoV includes most HCoVs and is divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice act as the gene source for alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs while birds are the primary storehouse for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers, and some of them have emerged as important pathogens for humans.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 ar type alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms such as a cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are severely pathogenic, causing infections of the lower respiratory tract in most patients and are more likely to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the appearance of exopulmonary symptoms.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, called B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, knowledge has grown through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until SARS broke out.
The 2003 SARS outbreak, one of the most devastating outbreaks in modern times, infected more than 8,000 people and its crude fatality rate was about 10 percent.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak sparked an outbreak of a pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread scatteredly to other parts of the world.
In 2019, a novel HCoV (2019-nCoV) which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, became the cause of a pandemic of coronavirus disease in 2019 that killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 by March 3, 2020.
The danger ring is being played out and the world must prepare itself for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Each of the seven HCoVs has an animal origin that includes bats, mice or pets.
There is ample evidence that the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs is in bats, in which the viruses are well adapted and present without symptoms of disease and show high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created tremendous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the origin of animal disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, triggering and limiting factors of mutation of species.
This may also facilitate the search for a reservoir, intermediate host and animal hosts for the reinforcing SARS-CoV-2 and have important implications for preventing future pandemics.
In this review, we will be looking at the animal origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss this common theme in which the parent HCoV viruses in their natural biota are not normally pathogenic, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also examine the evolutionary process of HCoVs in which increased viral transmission is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The implications of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in this context have also been discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, from nasal secretions of patients with a mild cold, different CoVs had been isolated in various animal species including buck, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) can be informative and well-informed.
In 1966, the first virus sequence HCoV-229E was sampled from the respiratory tract of patients with an upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently made compatible for growth in WI-38 lung cell cultures.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of a common cold, including headache, sneezing, weakness and sore throat, and fever and cough were seen in 10 to 20 percent of them.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture in the laboratory and gradually introduced into the brains of small mice.
It appears that the clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those produced by HCoV-229E, which are not detectable in terms of symptoms from other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 are both globally distributed and are mainly transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the inactivity time of these two viruses is less than a week and after that, the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild cold.
Only in a few immunocompromised patients, severe lower respiratory tract infection was observed.
SARS, also known as "Pneumonia at Peak", is the first pandemic in human history to be caused by SARS-CoV and the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS outbreak caused 8,096 illnesses and 774 deaths and caused outbreaks in many countries and continents.
Except for extreme cases of transmission, it is estimated that each case of infection can infect approximately two others, the incubation period is 4 to 7 days and the peak viral frequency appears on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness and tremors, followed by shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath as the later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests and elevated seratin kinase, are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Widespread aloecular destruction, the proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in their macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Subsequently, about 20 to 30 percent of patients required intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including the digestive tract, liver and kidney were affected in acute cases which was usually accompanied by a cytokine storm which could be especially fatal in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first sampled during a pulmonary tissue biopsy operation of a relative of an indicated patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been many attempts to investigate HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in late 2004 from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was determined that the disease is common in young children, elderly patients and immunocompromised individuals with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchitis are common in disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
In another independent study, the isolation of the same virus from a nose sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands was described.
Although the virus was first identified in the Netherlands, it actually spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7% of chronic respiratory illnesses, with peak outbreaks occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, the HCoV-HKU1 virus is found worldwide and causes mild respiratory illness.
These four families, transmitted through the community, have adapted well to humans and are generally less prone to severe disease, although cases have occurred for unknown reasons, such as in a rare recently reported case, the badly infected HCoV-NL63 strain that has caused a lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain their self-sustainability in humans, the severity of virulence or congenital disease decreases.
MERS - CoV in 2012 was isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus originate from the Middle East, imported cases with secondary spread due to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak in South Korea was in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to SARS, which is known as advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is among the diseases caused by HCoVs that are unique to MERS.
More than 30 percent of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high fatality rate of 34.4 percent, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients infected with infectious diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the beginning of an outbreak of an under-respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a global public health emergency, naming the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 90,053 and the percentage of raw deaths was 3.4 percent.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while outside it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory infections that are manifested in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in that they are 82% higher in the nucleotide sequence due to their high hemology, they are also clustered in different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
It seems that SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but has a higher transmissibility.
Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 reportedly did not have any symptoms, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal significant similarities and differences.
The first is that the incubation period and duration of the time period of HCoV disease are also very similar.
In this respect SARS-CoV-2 follows the general course of other lung HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is mid-range for SARS-CoV and four HCoVs transmitted from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
One in a hundred SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibited characteristics usually seen in community-transmitted HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild or even in some cases asymptomatic symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of acute COVID-19 cases can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although slightly lower than that.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting patterns of HCoV and SARS-CoV transmitted from the community.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs transmitted from the community.
On the other hand, it must be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV decreases after a few times of human-to-human transmission.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be diagnosed in fecal samples.
Whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces or urine, like SARS-CoV, plays a significant role in transmission, at least in some circumstances, must be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2, like community-transmitted HCoVs, may be seasonal or not.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission from person to person will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
One in four community-transmitted HCoVs that produce mild symptoms of disease have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of an ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that used to cause severe illness in humans and humans who became infected with severe HCoV illnesses are now extinct.
For this purpose, HCoVs must be replicated in humans sufficiently to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize host-limiting factors.
In this case, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people become infected, the greater the chance of the virus becoming fully adaptable to humans.
If the virus adapts well, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human societies, causing a mild cold in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses do not require an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not compatible with humans and their transmission between humans cannot be sustainable.
These viruses need to be preserved and spread in their animal stores and are looking for an opportunity to infect willing human targets, which is likely to be done through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four community-derived HCoVs.
This virus, like community-transmitted HCoVs, has a high transmissibility, at least for now.
However, the pathogenicity of community-transmitted HCoVs is less and higher than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether the virus will fully adapt to humans and be transmitted between humans without an intermediate reservoir or animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of the HCoV, it would be useful to review the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and replicator hosts of the HCoV.
If the animal shelter is a close ancestor of the virus that has high homology at the surface of the nucleotide sequence, that animal acts as the evolutionary host for the HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted in the host and is not pathogenic to it.
Similarly, a host stores, uninterruptedly and for a long time, the HCoV.
In both cases, the host is also naturally infected and the host is the natural host of the HCoV or parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoVs had an intermediate host before infecting humans, or at about the same time, they are not well adapted to the new host and are often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal reservoir of human infection, and in the role of a multiplying host by providing the possibility of temporary multiplication of the virus and then its transmission to humans, increase the level of infection in humans.
If HCoV is unable to keep its transmission in the intermediate host stable, it can cause deadly infections.
Conversely, HCoVs can adapt to an intermediate host and even be present in the host group long-term.
In this case, the intermediate host acts as a physical repository host.
Epidemiological data suggest that the first person infected with SARS was in contact with predatory animals.
Subsequent surveys of the outbreak showed that levels of immunoglobulin G against the SARS virus were higher in sellers of animal products than in the general population.
For the first time, a number of masked palm frogs (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were diagnosed in a live animal market carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were almost identical to SARS-CoV.
A deleting 29-nucleotide trait for SARS-CoV has been found in strains taken at the beginning of a human epidemic.
At the same time, it has been reported that masked palm frogs inhabiting forests or farms that were not supplied to the live animal market were mostly negative for the presence of the SARS-CoV virus.This suggests that masked palm frogs are likely only an intermediate and replicating host, not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of the different animals in the markets of Guangzhou have antibodies against SARS-CoV, so the possibility that several species of small mammals may also act as intermediate booster hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these are apparently the ultimate hosts of SARS-CoV.
In the subsequent search for the natural animal host SARS-CoV, a type of coronavirus that was closely related to the bat CoV and was called SARS-associated coronavirus HKU3, Horse-toed bat (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) was created that lived in a Chinese horse-toed bat.
These bats were positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence was positive.
This virus and other bat CoVs share 88 to 92 percent nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies, in turn, laid the groundwork for a new theory that says the bat is the host of novel human pathogenic viruses.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) were also identified in bats, but apart from WIV1 none could be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 obtained from bat feces showed that ACE2 from bats, bats and humans is used as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS had the ability to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has been the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95% nucleonid sequence similarity.
Although there is a lot of similarity between these two types of viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 virus is not the direct parent SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis has classified MERS-CoV with a similar grouping such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a similar host receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter the virus.
The RNA-bound RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically most closely related to the beta-CoVs of bats identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat virus CoV-HKU25, have only an 87% similarity in terms of nucleotide sequence.
Bats therefore cannot be hosts to the immediate reservoir of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that mountain camels are positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies, a fact that is also true of Middle Eastern camels living in the African country.
Live MERS-CoVs similar to the virus found in humans were sampled from the nose of a mountain camel and determined that the camel was the real reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that symptoms are generally mild and very high virus repulsion has been observed in camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the feces - the oral route, which is also the main method of repelling the virus in bats.
However, one question that has remained unanswered since then is that in many confirmed MERS cases there was no history of contact with camels before symptoms appeared, which is likely attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has about a 96.2% nucleotide sequence similarity to the RaTG13 bat virus CoV isolated from the Slippery Sleeve Bat.
In cases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very good for determining parental relationship.
In other words, a bat cannot be the immediate reservoir host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus unless bat CoVs are produced in the future that are nearly identical.
Presumably, the animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which many early cases of COVID-19 have been observed, must be among wild animals sold and killed at the Hunanbode seafood market, suggesting a possible transmission of the virus from animal to human.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of small mammals at risk known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also be harbors of ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new genetic species of the CoV pangolin virus has about 85 to 92 percent similarity in nucleotide sequence to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, these viruses with about 90% nucleotide sequence similarity are equally associated with RaTG13.
These viruses are clustered into two subtypes of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a similar receptor binding domain to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% identical amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ more, albeit with a higher degree of sequence similarity across the genome.
In a previous study conducted on patient pangolins, it was reported that from lung samples, pieces of viral DNA were isolated that are strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used various sequencing methods and manual editing to create a part of the genome sequence that made up about 86.3% of the length of the virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the animal intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in a pangolin because there is a link between the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and the beta-CoVs associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is still not fully understood.
While the greatest sequence homology in RBD has been observed between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs associated with beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genomic sequence homology.
It is speculated that the high degree of similarity that exists between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 pangolin-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is due to concurrent evolution by means of selection.
A different proposal, however, is for recombinant beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Nootrkibi as a driving force in evolution is common among beta-CoVs.
Her judgments about the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not final.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoVs - NL63 and HCoV-229 may have derived from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
A bat CoV called .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in North American three-toed bats has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 which was discovered in Ghana, while its complement is also suspected as a medium host for this virus.
For clarity, the available knowledge regarding the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 caused transmission between different animal species to infect humans through the urine, a respiratory infection pandemic broke out.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Multiple evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, that humans, not alpacas, may interact with bats in a shared ecological environment.
Instead, humans are closely related to the alkappas.
Second, alpha-CoVs of bats associated with HCoV-229E in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alpha-CoV alpacae cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpacae has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas have detected alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E in humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that cause disease in humans, including the herpes virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha-CoVs in bats act as the gene treasurer of HCoV-229E, alpacas and mountain camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as was seen in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to ostriches and from ostriches to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was evident from the very beginning of the virus' identification, and subsequent findings strengthened this theory.
It is clear that bats provide a rich repository of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic components and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, crowded clones, close social interaction and a strong ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats, which makes the O-ra an ideal virus carrier.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been imported into the U.S. for decades.
The virus has adapted well to these camels and the camel has been transformed from an intermediate host to a stable and natural host.
MERS-CoVs cause very mild disease and in these animals, the mutation rate is relatively low.
Occasional transmission of the virus to humans is a random chance and humans are the host of the MERS-CoV since its transmission cannot be sustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if indeed they have a role in this case, is different in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Especially that pangolin beta-CoV in pangolins is highly pathogenic.
These animals may be hosts of a host of SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs, similar to the host in the case of SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans that must be accepted or ruled out in future studies.
First, a bat could be the host of a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have an ecological status in common with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolin could be one of the booster intermediate hosts into which a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Humans can also become infected with the virus through butchery and eating meat from hunting.
There is a possibility that many mammals including domestic animals are relatively susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody testing of domestic and wild animals is essential.
Third, as noted above, the neutrequebrity and adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different animal host types, three other factors from the virus side are also important to facilitate the passage of the CoV through existing barriers.
First of all, there is a relatively high rate of mutation in their RNA replication.
The estimated mutation rate in the CoV virus, with an average replacement rate, is equivalent to about 10-4 replacements per year per site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new host, which can be considered "average" to "higher" compared to other RNA viruses.
CoVs have an exoribonuclease correction error whose deletion can lead to very high mutations, mortality or even inability to continue survival.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue is inhibited from replicating by inhibiting exoribonucleases and RNA-dependent polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 that should be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than their host.
In addition, the mutation rate is high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of its compatibility with humans.
It is likely that the virus is now adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this theme holds true for MERS-CoV, which is well-suited to the camel.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic modification will be able to rapidly degrade vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 without affecting them.
Second, the large RNA genome in the CoVs, gives extra flexibility in modifying the genome for genetic and nootropic mutations and thus increases the likelihood of mutual mutation between species which, under the right conditions, contributes to the emergence of new CoVs.
This theme is supported by a high amount of unique readability frameworks and protein functions that are encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, the CoVs randomly and repeatedly change their shapes during RNA replication through a unique "copy-selection" mechanism.
In the host that acts as a mixing reservoir, string substitution occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
Subgenomic and perfectly homologous RNAs with long lengths can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat-CoV and bat-CoV-HKU9, phylogenetic evidence for natural nootropics has been found.
Virus - host interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral agents mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV neutreceptor is considered a normal specimen, which suggests evidence of positive ra selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on a comparative analysis between isolated human samples and SARS-CoVs from the seeds, it is thought that SARS-CoV has rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations in the RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD in the protein S of the CoV virus interacts with a cellular receptor and stimulates an intense host antibody reaction.
In the SARS-CoV virus, it is located in amino acids 318 to 510 and on fragmentS1, which binds to human ACE2 and common viral entry receptors.
The RBD SARS-CoV virus is able to detect ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, seals, mice and dog raccoons, providing the possibility of interspecies transmission for the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only the remaining 6 amino acids with viral samples taken from humans and mice differ in RBD, and 4 of them are in the receptor binding motif to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV suite has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the propensity for the interaction of the spleen protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid successors may be vital for viral adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has a cellular receptor similar to SARS-CoV.
The presence of a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit suggests that the tendency for binding of the S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows that there is a 10 to 20-fold tendency for this translocation between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another common receptor is required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S..
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV - OC43.
These receptors may also be an explanation for the successful adaptation of the CoV to humans after interspecies transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-dependent and restricting factors.
The differentiation of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV hosts such as bats, camels and rodents may create an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
For successful inter-species transmission, HCoVs must control host-dependent factors and eliminate host-restricting factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction must be identified and characterized.
Fully neutral genome-wide screening of host dependence and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
The birth of new HCoVs: from the very beginning
The diversity of bat CoVs has provided ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat CoVs act as the gene store for the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic neutrequebris also advance the evolutionary path of HCoVs and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter the phenotypes of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV secondary proteins, the ORF8 protein is thought to play an important role in human adaptation, since after isolating the SARS-CoV-associated bat virus, it was found that this virus encodes different ORF8 proteins.
The deletion feature nucleotide-29 of the SARS-CoV virus in isolated strains has been observed at the beginning of a human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that contributes to host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible neutrecyclic history with ancestors of alpha and gamma CoVs, in which a large number of smaller neutrecyclic domains in RNA polymerase bound RNA were identified.
The location of the neuron in nsp9, the bulk of nsp10 and parts of nsp14 were identified.
It has also been shown that the pandemic-causing MERS-CoV virus has experienced different inter-parental neutrecyclic events that occurred as far back as the Arabian Camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, neutrecyclic events have also been observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs combine with other animal CoVs in their own non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, which are most likely caused by the release of viruses from selective pressure exerted, for example by the host immune system.
A typical example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the primitive HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
Although intact and perfect ORF4 can be observed in viruses associated with HCoV-229E bat and camel, alpha-CoV alpaca with a single extra nucleotide leads to a change in the framework.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their reservoir hosts.
No or mild symptoms were diagnosed when the bats were infected with the CoVs, suggesting a mutual compatibility between the CoV and the bat.
It seems that bats have adapted anatomically and physiologically well to the CoV.
For example, a deficiency in the activation of the pre-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the damage caused by their CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the reorganization of the killer cell receptor inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and a low level of tissue compatibility of adult complex molecules class I.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by high metabolic activity in the host bat can both suppress CoV reproduction and reverse the effect of exoribonucleases, thereby providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic strains of the virus at the time of introduction of a new host.
CoV strains that are mostly pathogenic may be induced by neutrecyclicity, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein traits for host adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
These viruses multiply violently without encountering a strong host immune response.
Herein lies the mystery of why unsymptomatic pregnant women are seen and what causes severe conditions in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense activity of the immune system and cytokine storm in which the stronger the immune system response, the more severe the lung damage will be.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response to CoV replication is very weak.
Isolating the linkage of immune system response strategies may have beneficial effects in drug therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Interferon responses in bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be useful.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
With this reasoning, the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor in combination with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, from the general topic of the event SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV follow.
While beta-CoV bats with SARS-CoV have a 95% nucleotide homology, there is also a beta-CoV bat that has a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While the identified civet and other animals were market sanctuaries for viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be identified.
Pangolinis beta-CoVs that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may act as one of the intermediate hosts or pangolinis beta-CoVs could contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is still no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally made by humans, although there are questions in this regard.
The CoV has returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of HCoVs in bats and other animals has radically changed our understanding of the importance of animal HCoV origin and reservoirs in transmission to humans.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that the origin of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is bats and is transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and the sea otter in their markets, closing the seafood market and killing the sea otter was able to effectively end the SARS disease.
With the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent transmission from animals to humans, which is why the discovery of several cases of beta-CoV ancestors is pangolins that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarifying how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans still requires further research.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been around for a long time, having existed in mountain camels.
These camels are considered as an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
These camels are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as was done at the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be adopted to produce effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in conjunction with other contamination control measures.
Since we are unable to remove these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause disease outbreaks.
Variants of human-animal co-CoVs common in wildlife are circulating.
In particular, bat CoVs with the potential for transmission from animal to human are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for these human-animal co-infections to grow and recombine, leading to the emergence of new co-infections that are highly transmissible and lethal.
The culture of eating wild animals in some regions of China must be put aside to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the harsh test that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 have had on us, we need to have a better program for preparedness and response.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time on this planet.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until an opportunity arises to disperse.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, if people are trained to avoid them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts and will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and spread.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent human-animal shared viruses is for humans to stay away from the so-called ecological stores of natural human-animal shared viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, if a bat transmitted an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to a pangolin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions a bat and a pangolin could coexist in a common ecological position.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmission to humans, how did humans come into contact with bats?
Third, if a third mammal has actually acted as an intermediate host, how does it interact with different species including humans, bats and pangolins?
And finally, since many mammals including pets may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both care and experimental implantation should be performed.
Whether the target animal is a bat, a pangolin or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are nearly identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for "suspected sources" and "confirmed sources".
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Guide to the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a guide that provides our experience and is a good reference for combating the pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, awareness and knowledge will gradually increase based on advancing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continuously updated.
In this article, we provide a view of our guidelines and provide the most up-to-date diagnostic criteria for "suspect sources" and "confirmed sources" based on the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of a disease that is now officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the virus is also called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization has declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
The team has created a quick guide to combating the SARS-CoV-2 disease and published it online in the journal Systemic Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
Be aware that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge will gradually increase based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continually updated.
For example, the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, were published a total of seven times, in which some texts were changed.
Now Zhou and colleagues have provided a perspective on what the guide includes, which includes a simple scoring proposition based on their clinical experience.
Their paper added new evidence to our guide and also provided a valuable reference for the pandemic worldwide.
We acknowledge and express our appreciation for their outstanding work.
However, their paper needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (7th edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspected cases, one of the features of the epidemiological history must be combined with two cases of obvious clinical symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if there is no history of epidemic disease, it must satisfy three cases of obvious clinical symptoms:
Epidemiological history: (1) previous travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) previous contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) previous contact with patients with fever or respiratory illness from Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities in which COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) previous contact with confirmed clusters (number of more than 2 cases of COVID-19 or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school, classroom, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features taken from COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating a moderate, increased or decreased number of lymphocytes in the early stages of disease onset.
Confirmed cases should be diagnosed on the basis of suspected cases accompanied by one of the following pathogenic cases or evidence of serum as follows: 1) a PCR bleeding test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2; 2) a whole virus genome sequence that shows high homogeneity with the novel coronavirus; 3) positivity in terms of serum specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2; or a change in serum specific IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase of more than 4-fold in titer in the benign phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see if the bleeding PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenic diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then formal evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes were made based on the continuous work of researchers who were looking for an optimal nucleic acid diagnostic kit for rapid diagnosis and also based on sampling from the respiratory tract including blood sampling which allowed greater access to different samples and supported the positive specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that warns us to treat patients with unusual symptoms and patients who have no symptoms with caution.
Therefore, the chart by Zhou and colleagues needs to be updated, since in this flowchart an individual without clinical symptoms is classified as "low risk".
The privilege system also needs to be put into practice and confirmed by further clinical studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will be presented and we ask readers to provide their views.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious sources" and "confirmed sources", we suggest that physicians follow and follow the latest guidelines of their countries.
Our team will also regularly update the guide to provide support.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death toll to date.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in the course of the day.
This is the highest daily death toll ever due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that there are recorded cases of infection, including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who are resting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said at an online news conference that the death toll was four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two cases were between 50 and 60 years old and one case was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 pandemic as a pandemic.
A hospital employee told Anadolu News Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead, Jalal Sefoor Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was under care at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, announced in an online video notification that public transport will be closed until next Saturday, which is longer than originally planned.
The public transportation closure initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of basic goods - medical supplies, fuel and food - continued to be continued.
The first case of COVID-19 was recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 by two passengers who had returned from Italy and also the spouse of one of them.
On March 19, all three people recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than a million people worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that as of Thursday, the total number of coronavirus infections worldwide has exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia, the day turned into a milestone.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed that the country is one of the few countries free of coronavirus infection.
The World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases as of yesterday, of which 79,332 were related to the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS NEWS, based on data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths in the United States due to coronavirus infection were recorded on Wednesday.
Various countries around the world have taken more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow on Thursday, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that nationwide, the rights and wages of the Russian people, without the need to be the head of the Burund labor, will be paid by April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for another 15 days; the law was approved with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended the traffic restrictions in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all hours of the day; previously, the traffic restrictions were only enforced between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to implement a frequency restriction between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Mike DeWine, Ohio's governor, announced that the state has extended home quarantine regulations through May 1.
Australian stores reduced their share of toilet paper purchases for every purchase they made.
The Woolworths and Coles chain stores in Australia, on Saturday and Sunday evening, lowered the purchase limit for toilet paper in all stores nationwide to two and one pack per purchase respectively.
ALDI store also announced on Monday a one-package purchase limit.
The restrictions were announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of the chain stores.
According to reports, shoppers from countries that require personal quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak are taking steps to buy and stock up.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
The changes were implemented in addition to the previous four-package limit per purchase announced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles announced in a press release on March 8 that despite the purchase limit of four packs, "the supply of many stores is sold out within an hour" and called this demand level "unprecedented", with the ALDI store also describing it as "unexpected" on its Facebook page on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesman, sales volume last week experienced a "severe increase".
A Costco store in Canberra, too, last week limited the amount of purchases allowed to two packages.
To reduce this shortage, Coles has ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery times to stores, Woolworths has ordered more inventory, ALDI has made inventory related to one of its special sale plans available earlier on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, announced that retailers are trying to increase their inventory, but local council restrictions on timing delivery trucks have made this difficult.
He said he expects production costs to rise as suppliers struggle to keep up with demand and fewer special sales.
On Tuesday, ALDI Store announced that some stores will not be able to hold a special sale on Wednesday due to early stock availability.
Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that stores are filling up their inventory every night.
He added that the sheer volume of toilet towels leads to a shortage of stocks in stores in terms of number and when this product is exhausted, it causes a lot of space to be emptied from the shelves and creates a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are too many products on the shelf, if products like toilet towels and disinfectant are available in high numbers and there is a possibility of buying them, your panic will probably be kept to a minimum.
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, announced last Wednesday that it was out of stock.
According to News.com.au, the company Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent toilet paper, both stressed that they operate 24/7 to meet the existing demand.
Domain.com, one of the most active sites in real estate, reported that when fewer auctions were held due to buyers being closed during the long Labor Day weekend holiday, some property sellers would donate free toilet towels to the first bidders in Melbourne.
The Thursday edition of NT News, one of Darwin's newspapers, featured an eight-page special to be brushed and used as a toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's report on 3 March, these stores were originally unwilling to impose restrictive measures and announced that they had no plans to impose restrictive measures on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other goods, including masks, disinfectant, dry goods, liquid and soap toilets and flour.
Outside Australia, similarly, the English online supermarket Ocado, on Sunday afternoon saw restrictions on the purchase of Andres toilet towels in the amount of two packs of 12 roubles.
The World Health Organization has declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an outbreak of the COVID-19 disease - which is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of a disease outbreak, not the degree of its danger, the WHO nevertheless stressed the need to market governments to countermeasures:
All countries can still change the duration of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General said that if countries prepare and place their people under diagnosis, testing, treatment, quarantine and tracking.
We are deeply concerned, both at the alarming level of disease outbreaks and severity, and at the alarming level of inadequate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: "Besides influenza, no other respiratory virus, from its inception to a continuing global outbreak, has been traced.
Ghebreyesus also said in a similar statement: "Before, we have never seen a pandemic that is caused by a coronavirus".
He continued, "And we've never seen a pandemic before that, at the same time, is controllable".
The new status as a pandemic was declared after the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency under international surveillance.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on the outbreak, said: "The frontline situation is getting worse".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 20-2019 is a progressive pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was declared a public health emergency under international surveillance on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at around 4%, while globally it has varied from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Its symptoms can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time interval from the virus entering the body to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from other people and monitoring and personal quarantine for people who are suspected of being infected.
Authorities in countries around the world have responded to the virus with travel restrictions, quarantines, martial law, workplace risk control and lockdowns.
The pandemic has led to severe socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and widespread resource shortages that are exacerbated by neural buying.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are either nationally or locally closed, affecting 99.4 percent of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and cases of xenophobia and discrimination against the Chinese population and other people who have an ethnicity and appearance from East and Southeast Asia, as well as other people from areas with widespread outbreaks of the virus, have been reported.
Due to travel restrictions and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and in early January 2020, investigations were launched in this area.
These cases were mainly linked to the wholesale market of seafood in Havana and for this reason the virus is thought to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later determined that the first known symptomatic individual became ill on 1 December 2019 and that the individual had no apparent connection to the next group related to the seafood market.
It was found that of the initial cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post newspaper claimed that a case had been traced back to 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hubei province who could be the first case.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that despite a reported decline in cases in China, there had been a sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea and for the first time the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases inside China.
The number of cases of infection may be reported at a significantly lower rate than is actually the case, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, a relatively small number of cases had been reported among young people, and people aged 19 and under accounted for only 2.4% of infections worldwide.[citation needed] Patrick Vallance, senior scientific adviser at the UK, estimated that around 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before the availability of herd immunity could be effectively provided.
By cases, we mean the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been declared positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted a formal policy of testing only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 showed that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 cases had gone undetected and these unreported cases were the source of 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy is significantly higher than reported.
Initial estimates of the base embolization number (R0) for COVID-19 have been between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number could be 5.7.
Most people who are infected with COVID-19 recover.
For those individuals who did not improve, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death was between 6 and 41 days, with the most common duration being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 70% of them had underlying conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. official statistics on the number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deaths whose test for COVID, according to official protocols, was positive.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 could be much higher, as these figures may not include people who died without testing - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Inadequate data from Italy showed that the number of deaths without testing during the pandemic was about 5-4 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "we know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual rate", which is consistent with unofficial reports based on lower-than-expected statistics in the United States.Such measures often occur in pandemics, including in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.The first confirmed death occurred on January 9, 2020 in Wuhan.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
By February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and government territories on all continents except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the level of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and general health status.The mortality rate is obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of diagnosed cases in a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate as of April 10, 2020, is equal to 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies from region to region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate was reduced from 17.3% (for people whose onset of symptoms was between January 10-1, 2020) to 0.7% (for those whose onset of symptoms was after February 1, 2020).Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people with identified infections that indicate a disease of the brain, and the disease mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people with (identified and unidentified) infections that indicate a disease of the brain.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from incubation to case resolution.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for particular populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for this pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
This maximum range estimate is consistent with the results obtained from the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany as well as a statistical study that analyzes the effect of the test on the CFR estimate.
The WHO reiterates that the pandemic is under control.
In the case of the peak and final duration of the outbreak, it is not possible to express with certainty and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated: "Common infectious diseases, if no measures are taken to control them, usually reach stability and begin to decline once the disease is cleared from the available hosts.
But at present, it is impossible to make any reasonable predictions about when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries mobilized to implement the World Health Organization recommendations on countermeasures for the outbreak of the virus, "the disease could be over by June".
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced on 17 March that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably be in circulation for one or two years".
According to research led by Neil Ferguson at the Royal College, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is made (possibly taking 18 months or more) ".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University declared "I think the likelihood that this coronavirus will completely disappear is low - because it is so easily transmissible" and "it may turn into a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
This intensity of the relapse will depend on herd immunity and the severity of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific and people with the disease may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms include fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms that are less common include fatigue, the production of chest congestion, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremors, vomiting, high blood pressure, diarrhea and cyanosis.The World Health Organization has announced that approximately one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, feeling pain or persistent pressure in the chest, sudden difficulty, difficulty waking up, blurring of the face and lips; in case of the onset of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, have no clinical symptoms but the test result confirms their infection, so researchers have recommended that people who have been in close contact with infected people should be carefully monitored and tested to prevent their infection.
Estimates made by China of the rate of asymptomatic individuals have varied from very low values to 44%.
The normal duration of respiration (the time between the individual's onset of illness and the onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this period is five days.As a sample of uncertainty, the statistic of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell was initially 30% but later decreased to 15%.
Some details regarding how the disease spreads are still being clarified.
It is thought that the disease is mainly transmitted through close contact and by small particles produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; and close contact means a distance between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that coughing without a cover can scatter small particles between 4.5 meters (15 feet) and 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some research has suggested that the virus can be transmitted by small particles produced by talking and also by longer periods in the air.Although the virus is not generally airborne, small respiratory particles can be produced by breathing, including spelling.
These fine particles can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or be transferred to their lungs through breathing.
Certain medical procedures such as breathing tubes and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can lead to the spraying of respiratory secretions into the air and consequently to an outbreak of chronic illness.
The disease is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns about the possibility of disease transmission through feces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Although there is also the possibility of transmission of disease before the onset of symptoms and later stages of the disease, the highest rate of transmission of the virus is in the first three days of symptoms.
People whose test results for the disease are positive up to three days before symptoms appear indicate that transmission of the disease before significant symptoms appear is possible.
There have been a few reports of asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) announced that although it is not fully clear how quickly the disease spreads, usually one infected person can infect two or three others.
Specifically, the virus has been shown to survive on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304 for up to three days, on cardboard for up to one day and on copper for up to four hours.
However, these values can vary depending on humidity and temperature. so far there have been cases of positive results in testing pets and other animals for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however British authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, as in the case of contact with other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first identified in three people with pneumonia who came into contact with a group of people with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that removes its protective coating.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought that the virus is of animal origin.
Genetic analysis showed that the coronavirus is genetically from the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarcovirus (strain B) along with two genes derived from bats.
The virus at the level of the overall genome is 96 percent compatible with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that between pangolin viruses and humans, there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of their genome sequence.
A complete genome comparison to date has concluded that a maximum of 92% of the genetic material between the coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is common, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Infection with the virus can be temporarily diagnosed through symptoms, however final confirmation is done through reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) filters of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific because many of the features of CT imaging are shared with other pulmonary inflammatory diseases and sympathetic disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or primary test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
This test uses instantaneous reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of these tests are usually apparent within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is performed with a nasopharynx swab, however, glue swabs can also be used. a number of laboratories and companies are currently working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these methods were sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex for emergency use has only been approved by a select number of reputable laboratories.
Characteristic imaging features in radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical Grand Glass Parameter faces and absence of side traces.
The Italian Association of Radiology is compiling an international online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases of the disease.
Unverified imaging by PCR, due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, cannot be used exclusively for the detection of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less imaging is specifically usable to diagnose the disease, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested that it could be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Complex neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the imaging characteristics of the virus both by radiography and by CT.
Some methods to prevent transmission of the disease include observing proper personal hygiene, handwashing, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with a hand-held seat and holding a towel when coughing or sneezing and throwing the towel directly in the trash.
Those who are already infected with the disease are recommended to wear surgical masks in public places.
Many governments have banned or recommended against non-essential travel to countries or regions where the disease is common.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community-level outbreaks in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and some people do not know where or how they have been infected.People who provide health care for potential infected are advised to observe standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection.Contact tracing is one of the important practices for health authorities to diagnose the source of contamination and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location information by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
Various applications for mobile phones have been created or proposed to be used voluntarily and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions that do not violate privacy such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
Some misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are spreading; for example, rinsing the nose or gargling with a mouthwash are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for COVID-19.
To prevent the spread of disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC recommends that individuals frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or in situations where hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after emptying their noses, coughing or sneezing.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body by household soap, which removes its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommends that in situations where soap and water are not readily available, alcohol-based disinfectants with at least 60% alcohol by volume be used.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with their sitting hands.
Removal of contamination from surfaces is possible by various methods (one minute exposure to disinfectant for rust-resistant steel surface), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betadine.
Other methods including benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID in a building such as an office or day care center, all departments such as offices, health services, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick persons should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with their own handkerchief or towel when coughing or sneezing and immediately discard the towel.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the volume and distance of the emission particles that are scattered when talking, sneezing or coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce people's willingness to touch their face, which, if not properly hand hygiene, is an important source of infection".
The World Health Organization recommends the wearing of masks by healthy individuals only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for people with COVID-19, however, they also confirm that wearing masks helps people refrain from hand-clapping their face.
Several countries have begun encouraging people in the community to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric.China, in particular, has recommended the use of single-use medical masks by healthy people in the community, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended that surgical masks be worn when using public transport or stopping in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make masks at home using cloth and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out and attending gatherings without wearing a mask or a mask.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all people to wear masks when going to public places, in order to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has made wearing a mask mandatory for those visiting grocery stores.
All residents of Israel are asked to wear masks while attending the rally.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has made passengers on its trains and intercity buses compelled to wear masks from April 1.
Panama has made wearing a mask mandatory when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford a mask make their own homemade masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves pollution control measures that are aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
These practices include quarantine; travel restrictions; closure of schools and workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
Individuals can implement these practices by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting and asking questions without contact and keeping physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments in areas where the disease is outbreaks have made social distancing mandatory or recommended it.
The maximum number of people recommended to gather by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (provided there is no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
Older people and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and immune system deficiency are at increased risk for infection and severe complications, and the CDC has recommended that these categories of people stay at home as much as possible in areas where the disease has spread in the community.In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clearly indicate that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social ties, both virtual and remote.
The use of the term "social distancing" instead of encouraging people to maintain contact using alternative methods implied that individuals should enter complete social isolation.Some officials issued guidelines on sexual hygiene for use throughout the pandemic.
The guidelines included recommendations about having sex only with someone you live with, someone who is not infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
For people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of being infected, personal quarantine at home is recommended.
Many governments have made personal quarantine mandatory or recommended for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
The strictest personal quarantine guidelines have been issued for those who are in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the disease has been widely spread are advised to observe a 14-day personal quarantine from the time of last contact.
Strategies for controlling the outbreak of a disease include containment, suppression and reduction.
Control is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected individuals as well as introduce other measures to control the disease and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When controlling the spread of disease is no longer possible, efforts are shifted to a mitigation strategy: measures are taken to reduce the rate of outbreaks and reduce their impact on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be implemented simultaneously.
Suppression requires more drastic measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of baseline infections to less than 1.Part of managing the outbreak of an infectious disease is trying to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as clearing the pandemic curve.
This reduces the risk of putting undue pressure on health services and provides more time for the production and development of vaccines and therapies.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak of the disease include personal preventive measures including hand hygiene, mask-wearing, personal quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing including closing schools and cancelling events where there are large crowds; social partnerships to encourage acceptance and observance of these interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries also implemented a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented group screening and local quarantine and issued warnings about the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support for people with the disease to self-quarantine and imposed heavy fines for those who do not.
Simulations conducted for the UK and the US show that the strategy of mitigation (containment of the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak health demand by two-thirds and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and put undue pressure on the health system.
Suppression could be a better strategy but as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever is sooner), it must be maintained, because if measures are abandoned, the transmission rate will quickly return to the previous amount.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic, however, create social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug for COVID-19, although efforts are underway to make one, including testing existing drugs.
The use of nonprescription cold medications, drinking fluids and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injections and respiratory aids may be required.
The use of steroids can make the condition worse.
Several combinations that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19 if they are useful.
The World Health Organization has also announced "several traditional and home remedies" that could help relieve symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described capacity building and adapting the health system to the needs of COVID-19 patients as one of the key measures to combat the outbreak of the disease.
ECDC and the World Health Organization's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources to different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-essential surgeries where possible, isolating and isolating patients with COVID-19, and increasing intensive care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and available beds.
As to where the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero) was, there are different opinions.
The first case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a period of one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these individuals were associated with the wholesale market of Huan Seafood, which also sold live animals and one theory is that the origin of the virus was a species of these animals; that is, in other words, the virus has an animal origin.A group of people with pneumonia of unknown cause were observed on December 26 and were treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital who on December 27, reported the matter to Wuhan Jianghan CDC.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
The police advised eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to refrain from spreading false rumors and another doctor named Ai Fen was reprimanded by his superiors for issuing this warning.
Later, the Wuhan City Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization of the matter.
A large number of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause were reported to Wuhan health authorities, prompting them to launch an investigation into the matter in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of infected cases, roughly every seven and a half days, doubled.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transmitted to other Chinese provinces with the help of travel related to Chinese New Year and given that Wuhan is one of the transportation hubs and main hubs for relay exchange.
On January 20, 2020, China reported about 140 new cases, including one case in Beijing and one in Shenzhen in one day.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had symptoms as of January 20, 2020.By March 26, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world, ahead of China and Italy.By April 9, 2020, more than 1.31 million cases had been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and government territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many of the Schengen area countries restricted free movement and introduced border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the outbreak of disease including quarantine (also known as stay-at-home orders, asylum orders or home quarantine) and martial law.As of April 2, in the United States, about 300 million people or about 90% of the population were under some form of home quarantine, in the Philippines, more than 50 million people, in South Korea about 59 million people and in India 1.3 billion people were under home quarantine.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were placed under some form of quarantine, a figure that rose to 2.6 billion two days later - or about a third of the world's population.
Tracing back to the first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report says the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian, on December 26, observed a group of people with pneumonia of unknown cause, according to which, the hospital reported the matter to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Preliminary genetic testing on samples of patients on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus that was similar to SARS.
On December 31, a public notice was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission.
The World Health Organization was informed of the matter on the same day.
With the news in the media, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about the "spreading of rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a major campaign titled "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus that was later described by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China.
In what was then referred to as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sanitary belt was established on 23 January that stopped entry and exit from Wuhan, the issue spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei Province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many homes.
Officials also announced that a temporary hospital called Huoshenshan Hospital will be built, which will be completed in 10 days.
After that, another hospital called Leishenshan Hospital was built to handle more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan, including convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government launched other measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including health declarations for travelers and extended Spring Festival holidays.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau, in particular, have begun to take measures in the field of schools and universities.
Measures related to routine in several regions were initiated from China.
A travel restriction on entry and exit from Hubei was imposed.
Public transportation was reformed and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movement controls were imposed in many cities and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of restriction to go out.In March, after the outbreak of the disease entered the global stage, Chinese authorities adopted strict measures to prevent the virus from "spreading" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city.On March 23, in mainland China, only one case was transmitted domestically during the previous five days, which happened by a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the prevention of disease transmission at home had been taken seriously and the outbreak in China was under control.
On the same day, two months after the quarantine was imposed, travel restrictions in Hubei were eased, except for the city of Wuhan.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry into the country for holders of visas or residence permits would be suspended after March 28, and provided no details on when the implementation of this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The State Council announced that on April 4, which coincides with the Day of Pilgrimage of the Tomb-Worshippers, there will be a public mourning and a three-minute silence nationwide starting at 10:00 am, however, the central government requested families to pay respect to the departed online to observe physical distancing and in order to prevent a re-epidemic of COVID-19, in order to prevent a re-epidemic.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had been transmitted to South Korea via China.
The country's health department on February 20 reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly linked to a gathering in Daegu belonging to a new religious movement called the Church of Christ.

South Korea introduced a program for crowd screening and isolating individuals that was recognized as the largest and most organized program in the world for crowd screening and isolating all infected individuals as well as tracking and quarantining individuals who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods include compulsory self-reporting of symptoms for newly arrived international travellers through a mobile app, testing centers that can be entered by vehicle and results are determined the next day, and increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program, despite eliminating the quarantine of its entire cities, is considered one of the most successful programs in controlling the outbreak of disease.South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to impeach Moon for what they called mismanagement of the state, and some others praised his reaction.

The World Health Organization praised the efforts of Chinese authorities to manage and contain the pandemic.
The World Health Organization pointed to the contradiction between the SARS outbreak in 2004-2002 and the current crisis, in which Chinese officials were accused of a cover-up that would have hampered the success of efforts to prevent and contain the disease, but in the current crisis, the central government "regularly provided fresh news so that no atrocity would be created on the eve of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, Gauden Galea, a representative of the World Health Organization, in reaction to the decision of central authorities to ban transportation in Wuhan, announced: While the decision "certainly does not follow the recommendations of the World Health Organization", it is "a very important sign of commitment to contain the pandemic in the locality where the disease is most concentrated" and it was called "a decisive and unprecedented decision in the history of public health".On 30 January, after the confirmation of human-to-human transmission of the disease outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency under international surveillance (PHEIC) which was the sixth PHEIC emergency since it was first declared in 2009 during the swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was declared due to "the risk of a global outbreak of the disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack a robust health system".
Tedros said in response to the imposition of travel restrictions that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On February 5, the World Health Organization, citing the need to support low-income countries that "lack systems to detect people who have the virus, even if symptoms appear", requested a $675 million grant from the international community to help build strategic preparedness in these countries.
Tedros further declared in statements that "we are only as strong as our weakest limb" and urged the international community to "either invest today or spend more later".On February 11, the World Health Organization, at a press conference, named the disease COVID-19.

On February 14, a joint task force led by the World Health Organization in cooperation with China was activated to assist in internal management and assessment of "severity and transmissibility" by the deployment of World Health Organization experts and international experts in China, this work was done through hosting training workshops and holding meetings with key institutions at the national level, another task of the team was to conduct field visits in order to assess "the impact of counter-activities at provincial and city levels, including urban and rural areas".On February 25, the World Health Organization announced that "the world should make more efforts to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", also stating: "Although it is still too early to declare the disease a pandemic, but despite this, these countries should be "in the preparedness phase".
On February 28, World Health Organization officials announced that the assessment of the global threat of coronavirus has been raised from the level of "high" to "very high", which is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for all governments on the planet: wake up.
The virus may be on the way and you have to be prepared", stressing that the right countermeasures can prevent the world from experiencing "the worst case scenario".
Ryan also stated that the current data has not yet compelled public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, stressing that declaring this status means that "we have basically accepted that every human on the planet is at risk of contracting the virus".
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
The WHO director-general said that "the organization is deeply concerned, both at the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity and at the alarming level of failure to take appropriate action".The WHO faced a lot of criticism for its inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.

The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province, by the United States, Michael Gove, the British Cabinet Office minister, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
A number of provincial-level managers of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed from their jobs due to mismanagement of quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the way the political establishment is dealing with the outbreak in these areas.
Some analysts believe the move is aimed at keeping Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, safe from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, have rejected their previous confirmation that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan and raised a conspiracy theory about whether the origin of COVID-19 is from the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's administration dubbed the coronavirus the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and declared that "China's censorship has exacerbated the virus and turned it into a global pandemic", a remark that in turn was criticized by some critics as racist and "a move to divert public opinion from his government's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained some U.S. government information that described a media ploy that clearly originated with the National Security Council and titled the strategy "Everything Is Connected to China".
We were told to try and use every possible means including a press conference and television presence to get the message across".Media outlets including Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries where the virus has broken out are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
Josep Borrell, EU foreign policy chief, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes an attempt to influence through news circulation and the politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China wants to communicate with great diligence the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also, while reportedly sending aid to countries like Venezuela and Iran, has asked the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions prevented the delivery of 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba.
U.S. officials were also accused of moving aid sent to other countries back to their own country.
Disagreements about masks were also reported between different countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of ventilators that were on their way to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with the country, which had suffered the most negative effects of the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU said "they only China responded.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity".
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, ordered the Russian military to send military medicines, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, quoting an unnamed "high-level political source", reported that 80 percent of Russian aid has been "unused or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of starting a "geopolitical and diplomatic" showdown.
Attilio Fontana, president of Lombardy and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media report and expressed their gratitude for the aid.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "Putin, while sending aid to American partners, believes that when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment are strengthened and mobilized, if necessary, they will be able to make up for this move".
The planned NATO military exercise entitled "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, which is the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a more limited scale.
Kate Hudson, secretary of the Campaign to Denuclearize, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise, saying "in the current public health crisis, this exercise not only endangers the lives of U.S. soldiers and many participating European countries but also threatens the lives of residents of the countries where the exercise is being held".With the participation of about 20 lawmakers as well as 15 current or former political figures, the Iranian government was severely affected by the virus.
Hassan Rouhani, President of Iran on March 14, 2020, wrote a public letter to world leaders, requesting help, stating that his country is trying to combat the outbreak of the disease due to lack of access to global markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran.The outbreak of the disease has led to requests to the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, some of these policies include universal health care, universal child care, family entitlement leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts have predicted that the disease could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
After Japan announced that anyone arriving in Japan from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in locations designated by the government, South Korea criticized Japan's "vague and passive efforts in the area of quarantine".
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to impeach Moon for what they called mismanagement of the state, while others praised his reaction.The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the disease could allow governments to cling more to power.
Hungary's parliament has allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to personally make laws indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those who appear to have spread false information about the virus and how the government is managing the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several shortages of resources due to increased use of equipment to combat the outbreak, nerve buying and disruption in logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several locations have also witnessed a nervous shopping spree that has led to shelves being emptied of essential items such as food, toiletries and mineral water, and has created a sense of scarcity of resources.
In particular, the tech industry has warned about delays in shipping electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to price increases of up to twenty times the normal price and caused delays in the supply of medical goods of four to six months.
It has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world and the World Health Organization has warned that the issue will put healthcare workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou shoppers to sell Australian products to China.
Despite the high outbreak of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both regions have been left with severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat monopolies and the illegal purchase and sale of basic products have been successful, preventing the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its considerable agricultural produce, has not experienced a severe shortage, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, only occasionally were food shelves seen emptied and Chinese government officials marketed pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has been felt in China: According to media reports on March 16, China's economy in the first two months of 2020, due to measures taken by the government to slow the spread of the virus and a sharp decline in retail sales by 20.5%, was hit very hard.
Since mainland China is one of the world's major economies and manufacturing hubs, the outbreak of the virus is a significant destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist forecast that until a clearer picture of the possible consequences of the current situation is established, markets will remain volatile.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could be greater than the effects of the SARS outbreak in 2004-2002.
One of the experts at Washington University in St. Louis, points to a negative impact worth more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years, he estimates.
According to reports, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is "shrinking" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a decline in demand from China.
Global stock markets plummeted on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to heightened concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock market indices including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced their most severe fall since 2008 when the Dow fell by 1191 points, the largest single-day drop since the 2008-07 economic crisis.
All three indicators ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the top credit rating of China but maintained its negative view.
Stock markets once again fell due to fears of coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many people think a recession is likely.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economist, praised the emergency and timely measures taken by central banks and governments.
Central banks, compared to the 2008 financial crisis, are reacting faster.
Due to travel bans, closure of public places including tourist attractions and advice from governments to refrain from any travel around the world, tourism is one of the sectors that has suffered the most.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas have canceled flights due to declining demand and regional airline Flybe in the UK was closed.
The negative effects of the virus on the cruise ship industry have so far been unprecedented.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The pandemic, however, coincided with Chunyun, which is one of the main travel seasons and is associated with the Chinese New Year holidays.
A number of events, including New Year's Eve festivals attended by large crowds, were cancelled by national or regional governments and private companies including Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai also closed their shops and tourist attractions independently.
Many events and tourist attractions for the Lunar New Year, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions, were closed to prevent crowds from gathering.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of infectious disease control to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year's celebrations.
Visitors to retail stores in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East saw 60-50% of reviews.
The outbreak also led to a 43-33% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession created by the pandemic could push between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty, a situation that would not have been possible without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
A large portion of the population of about 300 million rural migrant workers, in the interior provinces in their homes or in Hubei province were trapped. in March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for state benefits.
According to forecasts by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could damage 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could rise by 32%. lockdowns in India have left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were daily wage earners) unemployed. a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Foundation found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. in Spain since the closure of businesses in mid-March 2020, about 900,000 workers have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme.  Almost half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to short-term state-subsidized work schemes known as Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term compensation scheme has also been implemented by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been deeply affected by the pandemic, with both the operations and human resources of relevant organizations - both working and independent - affected worldwide.
Organisations active in the field of culture and the arts have endeavoured to continue to fulfil their mission (which is often funded by public funds) of ensuring public access to cultural heritage, safeguarding the safety of their employees and supporting artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions around the world, in varying degrees, were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
Another consequence of the disease, which has recently been rapidly accelerating, is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, important sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week ceremonies in Rome, which were held during the last week of the Christian season of fasting and penance, have been canceled.
Many local bishops have advised elderly Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday services; some churches have made church services available via radio, live online broadcast or television, and others have made it possible to attend services by car.
The resident Roman Catholic bishop of Rome has closed his churches and meetinghouses and St. Peter's Square has been emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions have also canceled their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and cathedrals.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed the holy sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from visiting the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most of the major sporting events including the Europa League 20-2019, the Premier League 20-2019, Euro 2020, the NBA 20-2019 season and the NHL 20-2019 season have either been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak of the disease has hampered the hosting schedule for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "scheduled again for a date beyond 2020, at most for summer 2021".Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have also either been cancelled or postponed.
This issue has led many gamblers to turn to online sites, many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their registration volume. the entertainment industry has also been hit and many bands have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing artwork via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, including live broadcast concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work.
In the online space, many internet memes with the theme of coronavirus have spread so much that many of them deal with humor and various issues amid the existing uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent as well as people in disease centers in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, cases of fear, suspicion and hostile behavior have been observed.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) suggested a resurgence of racist sentiments among various groups around the world about whether the Chinese people were being punished by the virus or experiencing targeted punishment.
Some countries in Africa also witnessed a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese people both online and offline, to those in the virus-affected areas.
After the disease spread to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, were also exposed to suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea in an effort to stop the spread of the disease, initially signed leaflets banning Chinese from entering their country.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan# was trending on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians in the UK and the US, reported an increase in the rate of racist insults and attacks against themselves.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for naming the coronavirus the "Chinese virus", a term that critics saw as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreigners who had been evacuated from Wuhan and were being transferred to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students who were from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and were studying in India's main cities, experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state wing in West Bengal, declared that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "for this reason, God has taken vengeance on them".
In China, the pandemic ignited xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, and foreigners were labeled "foreign trash" and targeted for "throwing out".
Many newspapers with a paid subscription removed the subscription fee for all or part of the coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak of the disease freely available.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on pre-release version servers such as bioRxiv.

Testing for respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus, includes methods to diagnose the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects RNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and only detects RNA virus SARS-CoV-2.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibody testing (serology) is useful for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected with the disease, counting people who have very mild symptoms and have not reported them or have no symptoms at all.
Using the results of this test, the exact disease mortality rate and herd immunity level in the population is predictable.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the extent of the disease's prevalence in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are large differences in the number of tests carried out between countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the reported mortality rate, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
The test, which uses instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), can be performed on respiratory samples taken by various methods including nasopharynx swabs or mixed samples.
The results of these tests are usually apparent within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test, which is performed with glue swabs, only provides reliable results in the first week of illness.
After that, the virus can disappear from the throat, while it is replicating in the lungs.
For infected individuals who are tested in the second week, replacement samples can be taken from deep in the respiratory tract by catheter suction or there is also the possibility of using materials obtained from coughing (mixing).
One of the first samples of the PCR test was invented in January 2020 at the Charité in Berlin using instantaneous reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a testing method by 23 January 2020.The company Kogenebiotech from South Korea on 28 January 2020, developed a PCR-based clinical diagnosis kit for SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus).
The kit tracks the "E" gene that is common to all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval for a PCR-based diagnostic kit for the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the National Medical Products Organization of China.In the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing RT-PCR instantaneous coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panels among public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kit had led to uncertain results due to defective identifiers and testing limitations at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout February.
As of February 28, 2020, a test using two components had not provided a reliable diagnosis and it was only after that that state and local laboratories received permission to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, under emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories in early March 2020, began conducting the test.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that the RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test is now available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also similarly made the COVID-19 test available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No limitation on the number of tests was announced; sample collection and processing must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development of the COVID-19 test kits was carried out by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had invented a test for COVID-19 disease.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours at high volume, this subject allowed one device to perform about 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the m2000 system to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received similar EUA clearance from the FDA for a trial that lasts 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a trial that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of alternating blood cycles, this method can provide a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
A test that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid (N protein) protein is being developed in Taiwan and hopes to be able to deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes, just like a rapid flu test.
A review of research conducted in March 2020 concludes that "radiographs of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings can be identified even before symptoms appear".
Typical features in CT include a matte glass quadruple multi-lobule with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subcutaneous dominance, defective coating and stiffness occur.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the start of the current pandemic, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific because many of the features of CT imaging are symbiotic with other pulmonary infections and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening or primary test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".As of March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR method for primary screening.
Part of the immune system's response to the infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to diagnose infection in individuals 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, diagnose immunity and monitor the population.This test can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through inpatient testing (PoCT).
High-capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production scale of each system.
For CLT, usually one sample of ambient blood is used, although to track the immune system response, it is possible to use multiple samples in succession.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually taken by perforating the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA published a list of 29 entities that, as requested, had notified the organization and were therefore now able to distribute their own antigen tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Diagnostics Laboratory and Epitope Diagnostics, obtained European approval for their test kits.These kits could identify IgG and IgA antibodies that had been filtered against the virus and were present in a blood sample.
The testing capacity is a few hundred samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test for virus RNA detection.
These antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the disease.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were adequate enough for use.
The NHS UK has announced that it is running a pilot scheme to collect a test from suspected cases at home which eliminates the risk of others being infected if the patient visits the hospital and also if an ambulance is used and the need for disinfection.In a centre where it is possible to enter a vehicle to test suspected cases for COVID-19, a healthcare professional will, subject to appropriate precautions, take the initiative to collect a sample.
In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance announced on March 2 that it has a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in mobile form and in the previous week, over 10,700 people were tested.
If the test is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Foundation, Germany has a total capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
From 19 March, the possibility of testing with a vehicle has been provided in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was not known because only positive results were reported.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that by calendar week 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested by the end of week 12/2020 and the result of 33,491 samples (6.9%) had been positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, which they did by combining samples and then performing further tests only if the result of the combined sample was positive.In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, a temporary emergency diagnostic laboratory with an area of 2,000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: Fire Eye or "Fire Fountain") was inaugurated by BGI with a processing capacity of 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the lab took 5 days and its construction was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, modeling showed that if this testing capacity was not brought into use, the number of cases in Wuhan would be 47% higher and the costs associated with quarantine would be doubled.
Similar samples from the Wuhan lab, titled Huo-Yan Labs, were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity reached 500,000 tests per day. the open and composite text designs released by Origami Experiments, can test samples from 1,122 patients using only 93 COVID-19 test kits. these equivalent designs are feasible in small laboratories and without the need for a robotic fluid probe.
By March, the shortage and lack of sufficient tracer had turned into a barrier to mass testing in Europe, the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to investigate sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing a large number of its population for coronavirus, a higher per capita ratio than any other country and is thus succeeding in getting testing to a major portion of its population.
This was made possible due to the vehicle testing capability and the purchase of a large laboratory on the scale of the country's total population from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency diagnostic laboratories in China).
The lab, which was built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab of this scale to operate outside China.
Different test protocols that target different parts of the coronavirus genetic characteristics had been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization used German guidelines to produce and ship kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce domestic kits.
Since the protocol prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, the delay in starting trials in the United States was caused by China and the United States having difficulty in measuring the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries along with Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and cases recommended by health professionals for testing.
In contrast, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The capacity to conduct testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, was built up over a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for strengthening testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States to be delayed and the availability of swabs and chemical reagents to be scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy measurement of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits produced by the CDC were "deficient".The government then tolerated bureaucratic barriers to conducting special tests.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were not accurate.
The company explained that inaccurate results may result in difficulty in collecting samples or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish minister announced that he would not use the kits that gave false results and would replace them with a different test kit supplied by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic had purchased from China gave false results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which gave false results.
Prime Minister Matevich suggested that the kits be poured into the Danube River.Ates Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and were not considered "usable goods".The UK government purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced that the kits were not usable.
And a trial that sought to quarantine people whose test result was positive and trace those who had been in contact with people with a positive SARS-CoV-2 virus result has had positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, where the first death from COVID-19 in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of testing ten days apart on a total population of about 3,400 people.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all positive cases were quarantined.
By limiting travel to public centers, new infections have been completely eliminated.
With strict tracking of people who have been in contact, restriction, testing and quarantine of inbound travelers, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore developed much more slowly than in other developed countries, of course without severe restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and retail centers.
Many events have been cancelled and Singapore on 28 March advised residents to stay at home, but schools reopened after the holidays, on 23 March and at their own scheduled time.
Several other countries including Iceland and South Korea also managed the pandemic with serious tracking of people who had been in contact, restrictions, testing and quarantining of incoming travelers, albeit with fewer closures.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have conducted more tests relative to the number of deaths have a much lower mortality rate, probably because these countries are better able to diagnose those who have only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in the field of COVID-19, send five positive first samples and ten negative first samples of their COVID-19 test to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% positive over total tests" is influenced by the testing policy of each country.
If all other conditions are similar, the "positive% relative to total tests" in a country that tests only people admitted to hospitals compared to a country that tests all citizens, whether they have the flu or not, would be higher.
Hand washing, also referred to as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning an individual's hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted materials.
Washing hands with soap continuously in "sensitive areas" throughout the day prevents the outbreak of many diseases, for example diarrhea and plagues that are transmitted through feces.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may get respiratory illnesses such as flu or colds.
Five important positions throughout the day where handwashing with soap is important include: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the child or changing diapers and, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following cases:
Before, during and after preparing food.
and before and after caring for a sick individual.
After changing diapers or cleaning the baby after using the toilet.
After blowing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal waste or feeding animals.
Hygiene from a medical point of view refers to hygienic measures related to medical practices.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent the infection or minimize transmission.
The main purpose of hand washing from a medical point of view is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in medical-related occupations, but of course it is also important for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious agents diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduced infant mortality rates during home births.
A 2013 study found that improvements in handwashing practices may lead to slight improvements in growth height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, mortality rates from respiratory diseases and childhood diarrhea could be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap.
This simple measure could reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by about one-third, which is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap as an automatic behavior that has become habitual in homes, schools and communities around the world is the single, most effective and cheapest method to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, which is one of the important acute respiratory infections, is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years old, causing the death of about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the deaths of approximately 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before meals and after using the toilet a firm habit could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, cut diarrhoea-related deaths by almost half and reduce deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against jaundice infection that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One harmful but minor effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to dry skin and consequent damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand-washing can lead to itchy skin, which is also referred to as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is very common, especially among health care workers.
Excessive and frequent hand washing is also referred to as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Five important times throughout the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of fecal-oral disease are: after going to the toilet (feces, stool), after cleaning the child (replacing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other instances in which proper handwashing procedures should be observed in order to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or venting; after touching animal waste or touching animals; and after contact with garbage.
In many countries, the standard for handwashing with soap is very low.
A study in 2014 found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of handwashing with soap, 97 percent; the United States is in the middle class with 77 percent and China is at the bottom with 23 percent. There are currently several methods for changing behavior to increase the rate of handwashing with soap at important times.
The Basic Health Care Programs implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines are an example of a comprehensive initiative to improve the level of health and education in children.
Disinfection twice a year along with daily hand washing with soap, daily flushing with fluoride, is the main focus of this national program.
In Indonesia, the program has also been successfully implemented.
Adding soap or detergents to water is effective in eliminating microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solubility barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins that are part of organic soil do not easily dissolve in water.
However, flowing a sufficient amount of water will help in cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may retain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have investigated the transmission of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that bacterial transmission in this way seems remote because the bacteria are washed with a floor.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still believes that "liquid soap that is accessible without direct hand contact is better".
Antibacterial soaps for people who care about hygiene have been heavily advertised.
To date, there is no evidence that disinfectants or disinfectants are effective at killing antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps containing common antibacterial substances such as triclosan may be resistant to a wide variety of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant species are not treated with the antibacterial soaps from Ben Brundt, these soaps may not be as effective as advertised on the market.
Advanced formulations, in addition to surfactants and skin care, may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin softeners (potatoes, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts). a comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health showed that ordinary soap is as effective as ordinary antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and killing hand bacteria.
The hot water used for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm water with soap is more effective at removing natural oils that contain dust and bacteria than cold water with soap.
Despite this and contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing microbial load on hands.
A hand sanitizer is a non-water based hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based general alcohol hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based disinfectants or hand sanitizers) gained popularity.
Most of these are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol along with a thickening agent such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) and in the form of a gel, or for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol they use a diluent such as glycerin and are made in liquid or powder form.
Addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide leads to increased antimicrobial activity.Antimicrobials containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol are effective antimicrobials.
Alcohol-containing disinfectants are used to kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB and some viruses (including HIV, TB, RSV, rhinovirus, cowpox, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% total, 30 seconds after use, cause the elimination of 99.97% (minus 3.5 logs equivalent to minus 35 decibels) of hand bacteria and 1 minute after use, cause the elimination of 99.99% to 99.999% (minus 4 to 5 logs) of hand bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, almost as effective as other virus (or Norwalk) strains of viruses that are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal disease, are completely ineffective.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or alcohol-containing gel should be used so that both hands are completely wet or covered.
The back and face of both hands and between and the tips of all fingers should be massaged for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing the bottom of both hands.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing the hands more than using hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are completely dirty.
Rosavzone uses these substances because of their ease of use and their ability to quickly kill microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients or moisturizers are added to their formulation.
Adding glycerin or other emollients to their formulation can reduce or eliminate the desiccant effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers that contained alcohol and emollients caused much less inflammation and dry skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact rash syndrome or allergy to alcohol or additives in alcohol-containing hand sanitizers, rarely occur.
The lower chance of developing contact dermatitis compared to hand washing with soap and water made them attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based materials do not clean hands of organic materials, but rather disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers as simple as soap and water are not effective in preventing the spread of many diseases, because pathogens still remain on hands.
The effect of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients and formulation and has historically been less effective than alcohol-containing hand sanitizers.
Recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have more cumulative and sustained antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and instead use ashes or ashes.
Ash or ashes may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Ash is also, like soap, an anti-disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
In the absence of soap, the World Health Organization recommends ashes or ashes as a substitute for soap.
The proper handwashing procedure recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Soak your hands in running hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended for the reason that still water may be contaminated, while water temperature does not appear to cause any change.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap and massage them, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates germs on the skin and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap compared to when using only water.
Massage your hands with them for at least 20 seconds.
Hand rubbing creates friction and helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing hands for longer will kill more germs.
Wash your hands with running water.
Rinsing in stagnant water can re-infect the hand.
Dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.
Most of the parts of the hand that remain sitting are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and excavated nail polish may be a hiding place for microorganisms.
Dry skin has led to skin damage and can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In situations where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save on water consumption, such as "tip tap or small water lions" and other low-cost options.
Tap tap is a simple technology made from a container suspended by a rope and a lever controlled by the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap mold.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public restrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study supported by the paper towel industry, the European Textiles Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster in London to compare the hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and the bacteria in the palms by 254%.
Drying hands with an air jet dryer led to an increase in the average total number of bacteria in the fingertips by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After rinsing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average decreased by 76% on fingertips and 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination transmission to other toilet users and the washing environment due to the use of different hand drying methods.
The air-jet dryer, which is claimed to blow air out at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 kilometers or 400 miles per hour), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of hands and devices and could potentially contaminate other people using the toilet as well as the toilet environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
Using a hot air dryer, it can disperse microorganisms up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were examined.
The following changes in a number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are a large number of hand dryer manufacturers and hand dryers have been compared to hand dryers with paper towels.
If soap and water are not available during travel, hand washing with hand sanitizing towels can be used as an alternative method.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Not long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis diagnosed the effectiveness of hand vaccination (in 1846) in preventing infection in a hospital setting, medical hand vaccination became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that can remind hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that the rate of infection was reduced by using them.
The time required for a medical hand wash is at least 15 seconds which is done using adequate amounts of soap and water or gel and massaging all parts of the hand.
The hands should be covered with them and the fingers crossed.
If there is pus under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water that is on the hands, it is very important that hands are well drained and dried with a clean towel.
After hand drying, a paper towel should be used to bind the water hose (and if necessary to open the exit door).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands due to contact with those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health care facilities is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is unacceptably lax in most hospital settings, so much so that a large number of doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before contact with patients, thus causing the transmission of microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce up to 66 percent of the levels of bloodstream contaminants in which catheters play a role.The World Health Organization has published a paper outlining the standard method of hand washing and hand massaging in both health care settings.
The draft hand hygiene guide prepared by the organization on its website is also publicly available.
A related review of the topic was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
If it is necessary to prove compliance with the prescribed regulations, commercial appliances can measure and verify the hand hygiene level.
The World Health Organization has defined "five times" for hand washing:
After being exposed to blood/body fluids
Before performing work related to disinfectant, and
After the patient has been cared for, the addition of chemical disinfectants to soaps ("medicinal" or "anti-microbial" soaps) enhances the disinfectant property of the hand washing agent.
The following are mandatory for hand washing before surgery: a water softener that can be opened and closed without direct contact, a quantity of chlorhexidine or a laxative, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing them and a sterilized special brush and other sterilized devices to clean under the nails.
All jewels must be brought out.
In this procedure, the hand and arm are required to wash the cuff for usually 2-6 minutes.
Long inhalation (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When drawing water, prevent water from returning to the handrail.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical clothing is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it has been determined that the greatest benefit of hand sanitization is obtained from the first 20% of the rinsing and when the hand cleaning frequency reaches more than 35%, there is very little additional benefit.
Handwashing with ordinary soap compared to antibacterial soap is three times more likely to cause transmission of bacterial infectious diseases to food.A comparison of handwashing with an alkali-based solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds showed that handwashing with alkali reduces the bacterial contamination balance by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
But the use of soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based handwashing in reducing the H1N1 influenza virus type A and Clostridium difficile from the hands.Measures to improve hand hygiene in health facilities could include training staff on handwashing, increasing access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers and providing written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions is more effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is remembered as an affordable and essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of safe water, soap or hand washing devices in homes, schools and workplaces challenges the availability of the necessary hand washing practices globally.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, water lions for hand washing near private or public toilets are rare, although cheaper options for building hand wash stations exist.
However, low rates of hand washing, mostly not due to the lack of soap or water, but can be the result of bad habits.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence electoral politics, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change at the societal level.
The monitoring and evaluation necessary to ensure the effective implementation of this work is mandatory.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social advertising campaigns are less effective.One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap while respecting other hygiene requirements.
By adhering to their minimum standards, schools can eventually upgrade from one star to three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations could be part of publicity campaigns for handwashing that are being carried out in order to reduce childhood illness and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaigns that aim to create a change in people's behaviour.In response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected the affordability of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost due to disability.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more economically viable than other measures.
For the first time, the importance of handwashing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as newly-born mothers or wounded soldiers in hospital - was highlighted in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale who was "the founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant odor called myasma.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illnesses and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more broadly promote hand hygiene as an important method of preventing infection outbreaks.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against infectious diseases.
For example, posters entitled "The correct methods of hand washing" were installed next to hand wash sinks in public toilets and latrines of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "to hold someone back from something" means to declare one's unwillingness to accept responsibility for or to participate in a subject.
The term is derived from the Bible of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate interfered with the decision to crucify Christ, but the phrase is now used in some English-speaking communities with a much broader application.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth, in an attempt to wipe off an imaginary stain, is forced to wash her hands, symbolizing her guilty conscience for a crime she had committed and had incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that individuals, after being reminded or reflecting on immoral actions, tend to wash their hands more often than others and are more likely to use hand washing equipment.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a deep cleaning are less likely to participate in other forced "cleaning" measures such as volunteer work.
Symbolic hand washing and the use of water and not soap to wash hands are part of the hand washing ritual that is displayed in many religions including Baha'i, Hindu, Toleh and Nitlat Yadaim in Judaism, Baz Wadow in Christianity and Wadow in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam command washing of hands after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam recommend the Shastan Dasta before and after each meal.
Managing risks associated with COVID-19 in the workplace.
Managing risks related to COVID-19 in the workplace means the use of safe hygiene practices to control risks in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate control of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and the type of job and should be based on an assessment of risk sources, severity of illness in the community and risk factors for workers who may be exposed to vulnerability to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announcement, occupations that are at lower risk, have less occupational contact with the general public and other colleagues, and for which basic infection prevention measures including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, observing respiratory etiquette and daily hygiene, and disinfecting the workplace environment are recommended.
Occupations that are at moderate risk include occupations where employees require frequent contact or close contact with people who have not been infected or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who are in contact with the general public, for example in schools, high-density work environments and in some high-volume retail outlets.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation through high-efficiency air filters, sneezing protectors and having personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends that health care workers who are in contact with people who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19, including those it knows to be at high risk, be at very high risk if employees perform work that leads to the production of airborne particles or collect, move or handle samples from people who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19.
An appropriate method for risk control for these individuals includes engineering controls such as the creation of negative pressure ventilation rooms and the use of personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects on the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, need for care of others, or fear of possible exposure.
Business patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are needed and in terms of how these goods are available (such as shopping during off-peak hours or shopping through home delivery services or buying by car).
Finally, the transportation of items from geographic areas that are severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped.The necessary preparedness and plans that respond to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
These programs assess and address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and job duties, including sources of exposure to disease, risk factors from the home and community environment, and individual risk factors for employees such as old age or chronic illness.
It also describes the control measures necessary to eliminate those risks as well as possible plans to deal with situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
The necessary preparedness and plans developed to respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The objectives of responding to disease outbreaks include reducing disease transmission among employees, protecting people who are most at risk of health side effects, preserving business operations and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in areas where business activities take place affects the decisions made.
A risk control hierarchy includes a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk controls in proportion to their effectiveness.
In cases where it is not possible to eliminate risks from COVID-19, the most effective control methods are engineering controls followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control methods are required to keep employees away from work-related hazards without relying on the speed of employees and can be the most cost-effective solution that is feasible.
Administrative controls methods involve changes in policies or operating procedures that are enforced by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative control methods, but it can prevent exposure to the virus to some extent.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk to employees, properly installed (e.g., respirator), continuously and correctly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and if necessary replaced, properly removed, cleaned and properly stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) statement, occupations that are at lower risk have less workplace contact with the general public and other colleagues.
Basic measures recommended to prevent infection in all work environments include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, observing respiratory etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, preparing paper towels and trash cans, preparing for remote work or alternating shifts if necessary, encouraging employees not to use other people's tools and equipment, and organizing a clean and disinfected work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home as long as they are free of fever, fever symptoms and other illness symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reducers or other symptom-modifying medications, and that leave policies should be flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for sick family members and keeping employees aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations at moderate risk include those where employees require frequent contact or close contact at a distance of less than six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not infected with or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel in areas where COVID-19 is widespread.
Administrative controls for these and groups at higher risk include: encouraging employees to stay home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up alternating shifts, making non-essential trips to places at risk of COVID-19, developing emergency communications programs including setting up a high-power air filter, increasing ventilation, installing physical barriers such as plastic protectors for sneezing and installing self-service windows to customers.Administrative controls for these and groups at higher risk include: encouraging employees to stay home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up alternating shifts, making non-essential trips to places at risk of COVID-19, developing emergency communications programs including setting up a monitoring association to respond to workers' exposure, training employees in COVID-19 risk factors and taking appropriate workplace protective measures, providing training and training to people who may need a minimum level of protection, including wearing protective clothing, providing a mask, or other measures to deal with the work environment, providing regular hand sanitation, and providing a safe working environment, including protective gloves and other protective equipment, if they require a minimum level of protection, and providing a safe work environment, and providing a safe and healthy work environment for those who may require a minimum level of protection, including a minimum level of protection and adequate personal protective equipment, and a safe work environment, and access to a safe work environment, and other health-related measures, including the installation of handbags or sanitary equipment, if they require a limited work environment.
Workers who are in this risk group rarely need to use a respirator.
If someone on board the aircraft becomes ill, appropriate measures to protect staff and other passengers could include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, allocating only one member of the crew to serve the patient and providing a face mask to the patient, or requesting the patient to cover his mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Aircraft crew should use disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or when in contact with body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and should use additional personal protective equipment if a sick person has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
For commercial transportation including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, control of the occurrence of hazards includes postponing travel in case of illness, individual quarantine and in case of fever or other symptoms during travel, promptly notifying the medical center on board.
For schools and child care centers, if an infected person has entered the school building regardless of the community outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends closing the premises for a short period of time for cleaning or disinfection purposes.
In the event that there is low or moderate community transmission of disease, the following measures can be implemented in the direction of social distancing: cancellation of academic tours, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical training classes or eating only in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, distancing between the times of entry and exit of people, limiting non-essential visitors and separate use of sanitary facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
When the likelihood of community transmission of disease is at a significant level, in addition to social distancing methods, long-term closure of schools should be considered.For law enforcement personnel who are performing their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lowers their immediate safety risk.
Law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with people who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact at the time of arrest, employees should clean and disinfect their belts and equipment before re-use with a household cleaning spray or towel, while following standard procedures for using and disposing of used personal protective equipment (PPE) and washing clothes.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers among those who are at high risk.
Occupations that are at high risk include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who have been exposed to people who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19.
Employees whose work leads to the production of airborne particles or who collect, move or handle samples from people infected or suspected of having COVID-19 are at very high risk.
Works that lead to the production of airborne particles include piping, cough drops, bronchoscopy and certain dental operations and examinations or aggressive sampling of a patient.
Additional engineering control methods for this group include creating isolation rooms for patients with or suspected of COVID-19, including when performing work that leads to the production of airborne particles.
Negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate for some healthcare facilities.
Patient samples should be handled with consideration of biochemical level 3 precautions.
In addition to the use of other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of a respirator for anyone who works within 6 feet of patients with or suspected of COVID-19, as well as for those who perform work that leads to the production of airborne particles.
In the United States, use an N95 respirator filter device that is approved by NIOSH and takes into account the interests of a comprehensive and written respiratory safety program that includes appropriate testing, training and medical examinations.
The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of full-body coverings because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks only for screening persons at entry points.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks, eyeglasses or face protection, gloves and gloves for people who collect respiratory system samples from patients or care for or transport COVID-19 patients and do not perform any activity that leads to the production of airborne particles.
In the event of work during which airborne particles are produced, surgical masks should be replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends the following to minimize the need for personal protective equipment: perform medical examinations in absentia, create physical barriers such as installing transparent windows, allow only those people directly involved in caring for a COVID-19 patient into the room, use personal protective equipment only for specific tasks, use a respiratory mask when caring for multiple patients who all have the same disease, monitor and coordinate the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and not use masks for people without symptoms.

This month we see ourselves in a significant context.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that clearly illuminates the global unity of human beings and our responsibilities to one another.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on the empathy, cooperation and community building that lie at the heart of this organization.
The companionship and level of care we have observed among our colleagues through email, contact and chat, reflect incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege and honor of working alongside.
Having all of you as colleagues, by my side, I am very grateful and proud of.
Last week, someone appreciated the work we do.
They reminded me how meaningful it is that the world can now refer to Wikipedia and what a powerful sign that this important resource can be made online and accessible to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep sites up to date or our colleagues get paid or our communities are safe.
The world, now more than ever, needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is the moment when not only what we do but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making significant changes to the way we conduct our joint work starting early next week.
Modifications related to our work and schedules
As Robin has previously noted, Team-c met last night to discuss an approach and a plan for the coming days and months.
During that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way for the organization to remain viable during this time.
We wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to lose weight, that's okay.
To all employees, contractors and contractual workers:
For the record, we don't have to wait for a 4-hour workday or a 20-hour workweek.
We're not announcing a strike - if you can work more normal hours, you'll be worth the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now and it doesn't matter if you're taking care of your loved ones, shopping for food, or seeing a doctor, your health is a priority for us.
We don't track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should go without saying, but we're not saying this.
There is no need to take medical or personal leave - just tell your manager and help your team go through calendars and schedules and make sure that someone has covered key tasks.
(If your COVID-19 test result is positive, please notify Bryan of the T&C department so that T&C can assist you and ensure that your condition is being properly managed.)
The salaries of employees who work overtime are paid in full.
As we have said before, we are committed to our obligations to contractors and collaborators who work part-time.
Salaries are paid on the basis of normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to release their stress into the world around them.
Something we do, especially in such situations, can be of immense value.
I reiterate, this is about your self-care.
We want you to communicate with your manager so we know what expectations to expect and can plan accordingly.
Some tasks are considered necessary.
There are cases that we have to do them.
SRE, HR Ops, trust and security, and capital raising (and a few others) teams do basic and important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with other departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus toward supporting those necessary for our mission.
There is a lot of work for all of us, we will all focus on the most basic projects.
If we slow down the process now, we won't be harmed later.
We don't plan to work twice as hard now as soon as the pandemic is over and to get things done.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impossible.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will seek to set new goals and timetables if necessary.
How does the APP (annual planning) work?
To adapt to new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to revise the delivery schedule of our 2021-2020 annual program.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 program that gives us more time to budget and allows employees to prioritize vital tasks, taking care of themselves and their loved ones, while also allowing those who need or may need to work fewer hours over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule greatly reduces the amount of stress on current work schedules throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and as soon as it is approved, we will inform the delegates and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the annual planning team for leading this effort.
Office situation, exposure to illness and cleaning
Last week we received information that a colleague based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have employed an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces as well as the side of the lobby and the elevator leading to a floor.
The building has adopted its own monitoring protocol and uses products that are beneficial to the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that when we decide to return, the office will be well prepared.
The Washington office is located in a WeWork and they have shared their COVID-19 protocols with us and all employees based in DC.
In accordance with San Francisco State guidelines, as of last week our Washington, DC office has been converted to a completely remote complex.
As some of my colleagues based in New York know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Old colleagues who work with us remotely know that this can be an adaptation to the situation and would like to make some recommendations to you:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, explore how they can be held over a few days.
Clearly specify the meeting, have a calendar, and send in the necessary study materials in advance.
Set up the video as the default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom so you can facilitate live collaboration and communication.
Assign someone responsible for leading the meeting, someone responsible for monitoring the chat to follow up on questions and list speakers, and someone for taking notes (or joint notes).
If you need a comfort meter, email the technical support team at Fast.
Use your health care allowance for snacks.
Link to the #remoties channel on Slack to talk about shared tasks with your colleagues.
The operations HR team to support the increase in work is distributed throughout the base, seeking webinar-based ergonomics guidance.
Last week we asked all recipients of grassroots-level financial incentives such as editathons to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia until the World Health Organization has declared the pandemic over.
We inform them that we are aware that our request for cancellation of programs and other restrictions may make it impossible to perform the agreed activities related to receiving financial benefits and that no one will be penalized for delaying or correcting their objectives.
Over the coming week we will be providing more guidance on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling throughout the global community seems to be both discomfort because of these disorders and at the same time a sense of relief because of their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
As soon as I'm done, CRT is trying to create a page in Meta-Wiki to make space available to the community to monitor the impacts and maintain our connections with them.
Staying in touch on issues related to COVID-19
For next Thursday, 14:00 UTC with 07:00 PT, we will send an invitation to a meeting for special staff to your calendars.
We will use this time to provide you with new and more information, answer your questions and keep in touch for a while.
We are all in this together and we are committed to assisting you in any way possible.
Meanwhile, you can find relevant information via this email and other information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT keeps these pages up to date and keeps all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular contact with those of our employees who are residents of countries that are already significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, mainstream work or challenging news coverage, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to notify and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help and support you if needed.
If you would like to talk about a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan - International Operations Manager Human Resources.
None of these changes should be construed as a resignation from work or commitments.
It also suggests that at this moment our work and commitments probably require adaptation in a way that we have not had in the past.
These are stages that we believe are essential to supporting each other so that we can continue our work and support our movement and provide the services that the world depends on.
The things we have planned for, when their time comes, will be waiting for us.
It's really time to support each other and create the atmosphere for the important work that is to be done in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we ask you to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be in your best shape when the need increases.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membrane) of lung, spleen, heart, kidney and intestinal cells.
ACE2 interferes with the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by decreasing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing (Ang(1-7 which is the same capability that has made it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of metalloenzyme containing a protein that is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains one domain of N-terminal peptidase M2 and one domain of the C-terminal renal amino acid colectin.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein whose enzyme active domain is located adjacent to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 along with another enzyme called shadas are separated from the transcriptional domain and the protein solution obtained after entering the bloodstream is ultimately excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membrane of type II granulocytes mainly of the lung, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial epithelial and exocrine cells and smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA signaling is seen in the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum, the hypothalamus and the brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is activity as an ACE inhibitor.
ACE is a hormone that converts angiotensin I into angiotensin-containing venous II.
ACE2 in turn separates the amino acid carboxyl-terminal ra of phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is hydrolyzed by angiotensin vein (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-Brady-Kane, apaline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane flow of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is implicated in the development of CHD.
ACE2, as a membrane protein, plays the role of the main cell entry point for some coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
More importantly, the adhesion of the spike protein S1 of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to intracellular inflammation and displacement of the virus and enzyme in intracellular endosomes.
This entry process requires the preparation of protein S by TMPRSS2 serine host protease, whose inhibition is under ongoing investigation as a potential treatment under investigation.It has been hypothesized that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, professional societies and several regulatory bodies have suggested that treatment with a standard ACE inhibitor and ARB be continued.
A rule-based and meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012 determined that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a dramatic 34 percent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.
Meanwhile, the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of developing pneumonia, especially those who had had a stroke and heart failure, was reduced.
The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a reduction in pneumonia deaths, although the results were weaker than the overall results of the risk of developing pneumonia.
It is speculated that human reverse acidosis ACE (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute renal injury and apparently improved hemodynamic respiration and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus the effective period (duration) is 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for individuals with sensitivity to systemic and classical rennin-angiotensin inhibitors (RSA inhibitors) or diseases that enhance angiotensin II circulation.The efficacy of rhACE2 injection has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory dysthymia syndrome.
b'Covid-19 apps are mobile software applications used for contact tracing during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying (contact) individuals who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
Various programs have been developed or proposed that in some territories and regions enjoy the support of public officials.
Multiple frameworks for the preparation of contact tracing programs have been developed.
Privacy concerns, especially in systems based on geolocation of application users, have been raised.
Less intrusive solutions include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will include the ability to support Bluetooth-centric apps directly in the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app with the help of which citizens can understand whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
The app is already in use in more than 200 cities in China.In Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is used.
The program has been developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the state.North Macedonia has released a Bluetooth-centric program called "StopKorona!" to track possible contact with infected individuals and provide immediate response to medical referrals.
The programme was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact isolation programme was in an advanced stage of development and would be ready for deployment within a few weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering programs based on the TraceTogether program and the BlueTrace protocol, while Russia plans to introduce a geographically limited program for COVID-19 patients and residents of Moscow to prevent these people from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has pointed out a number of practical problems associated with program-centric systems, including false positive results and potential inefficiencies if the program is used in small population samples.
In its investigation of problems related to the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the type of organizations that are allowed to add coronavirus apps to the App Store and only allows "official" or reputable organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance using coronavirus programs, and in particular have stated that it is unclear whether the surveillance infrastructure being created for the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations listed eight conditions for government initiatives:
Supervision must be lawful, necessary and proportionate;
The ironing and monitoring kits must have automatically cancellable locks;
the applicability of data should be limited to cases related to COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be guaranteed and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should not be seen as a pretext for exacerbating discrimination and isolation;
The transfer of data to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees must be taken into account to prevent abuse and the right of citizens to complain about abuse;
Targeted participation of all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups, is essential. the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published lists.
The proposed Google/Apple program aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing hardware tracking from their device operating systems, once the need is removed.
In some countries, a network-based locating process has been used instead of the program, thus eliminating the need to download the program and the ability to escape the tracking.
In Israel, grid-centric regulation has been adopted.
Network-centric solutions that have access to raw location data may violate privacy.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; a number of private cache systems use central servers only for internal communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-programmed system was used for contact tracing.
The system, instead of using a specialized program, collected tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and used it to send text notifications to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to message potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available.This type of disclosure of information has been authorized as a result of extensive changes in data protection laws, following the MERS outbreak in the country.
Some countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems and privacy-preserving memories.
As of April 6, 2020, these details have yet to be disclosed.
Privacy contact tracing is an accepted concept with a history of documented research dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, dozens of expert groups were working on privacy-preserving solutions, such as using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE), to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not protocol independent. of the decentralized protocols, one can point to decentralized near-deployment with privacy-preserving  (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, also known as contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and planetary contact tracking devices (PACT).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data is never removed from the device and all matching occurs inside the device.
The privacy team at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving practices in the process of collecting and consuming location and routing data, to track the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The platform is based on the research results contained in the official report "Application vulnerability: maintaining personal privacy during the pandemic" which was published in March 2020.Another similar innovation, the SafeTrace platform is a product of Enigma MPC.The company is focused on the development of privacy technologies that were formed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace with secure hardware technologies allows users to make sensitive health and location data available to other users and administrators without violating data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was formed by a number of groups, which had come together around what were essentially similar and mostly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing dispersion and providing a global cooperation framework in the field of prevention and alert programmes, of key aspects of wide adoption availability.
On 9th April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used in its official government program publicly available.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies controlling the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed is intended to preserve privacy.The initiative is based on a combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption.
They have also released the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be launched in three stages:
Introducing tools to empower governments to create privacy-preserving coronavirus prevention programs
Google and Apple intend to address the adoption and continuous monitoring problems by deploying the system through operating system updates and then removing it in a similar manner once the threat is removed.
Drug substitution (also known as drug re-use, re-profile, re-function or drug therapy re-use) is said to be the re-use of a drug approved to treat a disease or physical problem different from what the drug was originally developed for.
This is a line of scientific research that is being implemented to develop safe and effective COVID-19 therapies.
Other research goals include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the plasma transfer of a recovered individual.SARS-CoV-2 has a total of 66 medicinal proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
These linkage site analyses provide a rational blueprint for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include the quasi-papayain protease, RNA-binding RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ribophosphate ADP.
Hussein A. and colleagues reviewed several proposed drugs that at the time had been optimized and analyzed for their skeletal similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the process of developing a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in a preclinical study that was to be proposed in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are the related constituent of four drugs being studied in a single clinical trial.
Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24.On March 28, the FDA declared the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphates as "authorized emergency use" (EUA).
The therapy is not FDA-approved in the clinical trial process and its use is authorized under the EUA only for experimental therapy and emergency use in inpatients who are unable to receive the drug in the clinical trial.
The CDC has announced that the need for, dose of, or duration of hydroxychloroquine intake for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined.
Doctors have announced that they will take these drugs if they have no other option.
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey is conducting a small research project on the use of chloroquine in combination with rye, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China claimed that favipiravir was "completely effective".
The test result in 35 patients was negative at an average of 4 days, while the duration of illness in 45 diseases that had not been detected was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence available about the effectiveness of this drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug for its stockpile from Japan and request help from the army to deliver the drug to teaching hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made a proposal to the Trump administration to buy the drug, which may not be very effective in treating acute cases of illness in which the virus has multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or people who intend to become pregnant.
A review of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, determined that no benefit was observed.
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado are trying to refine these drugs to find a combination that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There has been criticism in the scientific community about redirecting resources toward changing the use of drugs that were specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international trial.
Gilead Sciences had developed the drug Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg viral infections.  Gilead Sciences later determined that Remdesivir was active in the laboratory environment against the viruses phyllo, pneumo, paramexo and corona. 
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the creation of resistance through mutation, which may lead to more severe disease and infection.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic inhibitor against the formation of resistance. Several clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland Teaching Hospital, are ongoing. One involves individuals with mild disease and the other involves individuals with severe disease.
Three clinical trials on the effectiveness of intravenous vitamin C injections on hospitalized individuals with severe COVID-19 disease are underway; two of them are pharmacologically controlled (China and Canada) and one is uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning to run a clinical trial for Alvesco Tigenin (cyclosoneid), a type of respiratory corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of asymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A phase II trial on the enzyme 2 converter angiotensin involving 200 patients is underway.200 inpatients from Denmark, Germany and Austria are being enrolled to determine the effectiveness of this therapy.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute of Canada are investigating the role of chloroquine in reducing inflammation and respiratory consequences in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, titled "CollonCorona", involved 6,000 patients at least 40 years old who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms and were not required to be admitted to hospital.
Pregnant or lactating women or women who are using effective methods of contraception are not eligible to participate in this study.
Several blood clotting drugs are under investigation in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients and for this reason the Italian Medical Agency has been obliged to publish guidelines for its use.
The news of a multicenter study involving 300 patients to investigate the effect of anoxaparin sodium intake on prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a strain of virus, significant scientific attention has focused on changing the application of antiviral drugs that were produced to treat previously infectious diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was proposed in accordance with the guidelines of the 7th China Review for the treatment of COVID-19.
Ome Fenovir: Ome Fenovir was proposed according to the guidelines of the 7th China version for the treatment of COVID-19.
Among the antibiotics that have been proposed as potential alternatives to COVID-19 therapies, the following may be noted:
Toquelezoumab (receptor Anti-IL-6): has been approved in China.
There are also trials in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'vaccine covid-19 a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is being developed.
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, multiple attempts to develop such a vaccine are underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available before the next 18 months.
Five vaccines proposed in April were under Phase I immunity studies.
COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019.
A widespread global outbreak in 2020 occurred and led to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the released genomes to produce a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that CEPI's requirements for vaccine development included speed, production capacity, stability of scale and average availability.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were under study and development in early 2020 to produce an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform, which is involved in Phase I safety studies, include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (phase I enhancer and proposed vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273) 
Viral carrier (phase I booster and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, carrier of adenovirus type 5) 
According to a CEPI scientists announcement in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them have been approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others have been made public but little information is publicly available (assuming they are in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II trials deal with preliminary safety and immunoassays, usually randomized and pharmacologically controlled, run in different centers and determine more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually have more participants including a control group and, while testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, do not detect adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 proposed vaccines in the active development phase (approved as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (still in the preclinical research phase).
On or about January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the ability of a molecular-based vaccine to genetically modify viral proteins and simulate an immune response.
On or about January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of research on the vaccine and that human trials are set to begin in 2021.
The vaccine development plans were presented at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, the pharmaceutical companies Janssen, under the management of Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun the process of developing a vaccine.

On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was ending its partnership with Novavax in the United States.
The field of vaccine development and production is newsworthy.
The partners later announced that they were set to complete the preclinical trial and the Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health in India announced that it is testing on 11 individuals in quarantine and that the development of a vaccine will take at least one and a half to two years in the shortest case.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, announced the development of a coronavirus-like particle partially funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The proposed vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human trials are scheduled to start in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that Donald Trump, the president of the United States, had proposed to CureVac that in return for paying a "huge sum of money" it would provide exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government has opposed.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a collaboration with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an mRNA-based vaccine.
A proposed mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, is currently in the preclinical trial phase and clinical trials are set to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, one of the Italian companies active in the field of biotechnology, announced that the results of their preclinical trials will be ready in April 2020 and their final proposed vaccine may be tested on humans before the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations to Fight Pandemics (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium, which includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the area of COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing six different proposed vaccines on animals.
Researchers at Royal College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-reinforcing RNA vaccine to combat COVID-19.
The proposed vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving information from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced that it was considering $275 million to fund 96 research projects in the area of COVID-19 response measures, including several proposed vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Government of Canada announced that $192 million Canada has been allocated specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans are underway to create a national vaccine bank consisting of several new vaccines, with the potential to be used in the event of other outbreaks of the coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of PittCoVacc, a proposed COVID-19 vaccine, on mice and announced that the single-subtype SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines with MNA strong antigen-specific antigen reactions [in mice] had eliminated the antigen that had been detected 2 weeks after immunization.
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy reported on the design of a proposed DNA-based vaccine, possibly in the form of a nose-to-nose.
Using bactericidal agents, this DNA will be engineered to replicate within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles.This process stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities merged their resources to access IBM clouds as well as the resources of the renowned cloud companies Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous or unusual effects.
That is, they may have benefits beyond the prevention of disease.
Another randomized trial in Australia is set to enroll 4,170 health care providers.
Vaccines in the production phase may not be safe or effective.
Early research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, suggests the need for bioinmunity level 3 contamination prevention measures to work with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard immunity routines.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine to treat or prevent SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
Based on research articles published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
During the MERS outbreak, the perception was that ongoing research on MERS would likely provide a useful framework for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that had undergone Phase I clinical trials in humans and there were three other vaccines that were all carriers of the virus.
The comments on social media have led to the spread of conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 virus being known and the existence of a vaccine against it.
The inventions mentioned in various social media refer to previous inventions related to genetic sequences and vaccines related to other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is known to be caused by the coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The general symptoms of the condition are fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, hearing loss and abdominal pain.
The time interval between exposure to the pathogen and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some cases also result in viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported worldwide from 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 of those cases resulting in death.
The virus is mainly transmitted by close contact, often through fine droplets caused by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although the airflow causes these droplets to spread, usually the droplets fall on the ground or surfaces instead of traveling over long distances.
People can become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
Of course, there is also the possibility of spreading the virus before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard diagnostic method is instantaneous reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharynx swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and those around them.
Recommendations for mask use vary for the general public; some officials oppose the use of masks and some approve, and some consider mask wearing mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries in each of the six areas under WHO coverage.
Individuals infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms can include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest area, dizziness, difficulty walking and bruising of the face or lips.
Upper respiratory tract-related symptoms, such as hoarseness, runny nose or sore throat have also been observed with less frequency.
E-gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in variable percentages.
Some cases in China had only early stages of shortness of breath and a rapid heartbeat.
In others, the disease may progress to the stage of pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death.
This period is called the period of the Naftaki.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of individuals, symptoms become apparent within 11.5 days of the moment of infection. reports suggest that not all infected individuals necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission process is not yet well established. however, preliminary evidence suggests that these individuals could be the cause of the disease outbreak.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) have announced that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital admission remain asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its statistics on April 1.Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both the mixture and saliva may be carrying the virus.
Talking out loud causes more particles to disperse compared to speaking slowly.
Researchers in Singapore have proven that covering your mouth and nose while coughing may cause small droplets to spread out over a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has announced that there is a possibility of airborne transmission and in air collectors installed in hallways outside people's rooms, traces of positive RNA virus-related samples have been seen.
Certain medical routines such as tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to spread and the virus to spread through the air.
Although there are concerns about transmission of the virus through feces, this is assumed to be a low probability. the probability of transmission of the virus through people with symptoms is higher. the probability of transmission of the virus before symptoms appear is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has announced that despite the uncertainty of the mechanism of disease transmission, each person usually infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus survives on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and rust-resistant steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for up to four hours.
Of course, this period depends on humidity and temperature.
Proper use of soap and detergent is also effective.Soap products have a protective layer of fat that kills the virus, inactivates it and keeps it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate of clarksidine (a surgical irritant), are less effective.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after bedtime.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a high viral load and in the sixth patient, the highest viral load was seen on the second day of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) is a novel coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome that was initially identified in three people with pneumonia and associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in coronaviruses of related nature.
The virus is eliminated outside the human body by household soap through the nose. protective bubble soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs because the virus enters the host cell via the enzyme 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is abundant in type II granule cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called spike (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was observed in 12% of infected people and hospitalization in Wuhan.This problem is more common in severe cases of illness.
The occurrence of rates of cardiovascular symptoms due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders in the course of disease progression is high but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and play a role in heart function.
High rates of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor diagnosis.Autopsy of individuals who died from COVID-19 has been indicative of diffuse atrial dysfunction (DAD) and the penetration of lymphocyte-containing inflammation into the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to have ACE2-containing membrane cells in the respiratory tract, symptoms of severe systemic inflammation have been observed in patients with COVID-19.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF T-cell scattering with the uptake of IL-6 scattering monocytes has been shown to cause inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte penetration has also been reported during anorexia.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard diagnostic method is the rRT-PCR (r-Run-Run Reverse Momentary Polymerase Chain Reaction).
This test is usually performed on breath samples obtained with nasopharynx swabs. of course, a nasal swab or a mixed sample is also applicable.
Results are usually ready within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can also be used but this requires taking two blood samples two weeks apart.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate and release the genetic sequence of a species of coronavirus, enabling laboratories around the world to run independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to diagnose viral infections.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which have the ability to diagnose active infections and a person's history of infection) were under study but were still not widely used.
The accuracy of this Chinese experience in the testing field is only 60 to 70%.
In the United States, the FDA approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines of Zhong Nan Hospital of Wuhan University have proposed methods for diagnosing infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
A double-multi-lobule glass matte with lateral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution is useful for diagnosis in the early stages of infection.
Subcutaneous overlap, defective coating (thickening of the bladder blade with variable granular sharpness) and stiffness may be signs of disease progression.
There is little information available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The most important pathological findings in autopsy include:
Macroscopy: side of the face, precardiogram, severity of cardiac and respiratory stiffness
Four levels of severity of viral pneumonia are observable:
Mild pneumonia: respiratory arrhythmias, hyperplastic pneumocytes, abnormal adult pneumocytes, intestinal inflammation with lymphocytic influence and the formation of a large multi-cell lung
Severe pulmonary disease: Dispersed granular injury (DAD) with dispersed granular secretions.
DAD is a factor in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Improving lung disease: formation of secretions in the granular cavities and respiratory fistula fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravenous coagulation (DIC); reaction to the locorithroplastic
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection can be noted as staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing and sneezing and using the inner part of your armpit, if the towel is not available.
It is recommended to observe hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has suggested the use of cloth masks in public places to some extent, to prevent the spread of disease by asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies are being pursued to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups of people through the closure of schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include the exception of a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters) between individuals.
Since the discovery of a vaccine is not envisaged until at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is trying to reduce the peak pandemic, or "flatten the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water.This wash is especially needed after leaving the toilet or having obviously contaminated their hands, before eating food and after passing urine, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcoholic hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% in the event of a lack of soap and water.For areas where standard hand sanitizers are not available, the WHO has proposed two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, an antimicrobial agent from ethanol or isopropanol is also obtained.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove the microbial alcohol; this active ingredient is not an effective hand sanitizer.
Glycerol is added as a moisture retainer.
Individuals are administered supportive care that may include fluid-therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs that have been damaged.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of having an infection wear a simple mask.
External bronchial membrane oxidation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under investigation.
Disregard for personal hygiene and changes in lifestyle and family diet are suggested to boost immunity.
WHO and the National Health Commission of China have made recommendations for the care of people who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection.
Special care physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various organizations in a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To relieve symptoms, some medical professionals have found the use of paracetamol (astaminophen) for first-line consumption to be better than ibuprofen.
To minimize the possibility of transmission of the virus, it is necessary to observe precautions, especially in treatment settings where routines that create suspended particles, such as piping or manual ventilation, are performed.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the individual in an airborne infection quarantine room (AIIR) and using standard precautions, contact prevention measures and airborne precautions.The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Suggested equipment includes: PPE, respiratory mask or face mask, eye protection and surgical gloves. If available, the use of a respiratory mask (instead of a face mask) is preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under the Authorized Emergency Use (EUA) category.
This mask is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but its effectiveness against special biological agents for consumption outside of its main use is not guaranteed.
If a mask is not available, the CDC recommends the use of face protection or, as a last resort, a handmade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require the use of mechanical ventilation or alternative methods, but about one percent of them require these measures.
Some evidence suggests that a high-flow cannula from the trachea or positive surface pressure in the airway can prevent the tubing.
Whether either of these two approaches leads to the achievement of similar benefits in patients with diarrhea is still unclear.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, if present, because this method limits the amount of fine particulate matter action compared to high-flow nasal cannula.The incidence of severe cases is higher in younger people (individuals over 60 years, and especially those over 80 years).
In many developed countries there are not enough hospital beds per capita, and as a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in cases of severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization is limited.
In a study conducted in China, it was found that 5% of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation and 1.4% were life-threatening.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection end up in the ICU for care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 intensifies and oxygen delivery becomes much more difficult.
To maximize oxygen delivery and minimize the likelihood of lung damage associated with the respiratory tract and the chest, the use of a respirator with high pressure control and PPEP conditions is essential.
Older air conditioners may not have a high PEEP.
Research into potential therapies began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising among the drugs.
Although the development of new drugs will take until 2021, several of the drugs under trial have already been approved for other uses or are in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medication may be tested in people with severe disease.
The FDA has issued a temporary authorization for the use of regenerative plasma as an experimental therapy; of course in cases where the life of an individual is severely or completely at risk.
This drug has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove efficacy and safety associated with the disease.
In February 2020, China unveiled a mobile app to manage the course of the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The program can identify 'closest contact' with the help of surveillance data and diagnose the likelihood of infection.
Each user can also check the status of up to three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the program, in addition to offering a home quarantine recommendation, reports the matter to local health authorities.Clan-data analysis on mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence have been used to track infected individuals and people associated with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government made it possible for security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of contracting COVID-19.
The measure was taken to protect people who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom made the collection of telephone location data available to the Robert Koch Institute, one of Germany's federal government agencies, to enable research into the process of virus outbreaks and prevention.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify people who are breaking quarantine.
Giulio Gallera, Italy's regional health officer, has been informed by mobile phone operators that 40% of people continue to move freely.
The German government held a 48-hour e-Hatathon over the weekend with the participation of more than 42,000 people.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, issued an appeal to attract creative strategies for preventing the coronavirus outbreak.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection may cause people to develop tension.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, psychological stress and economic difficulties can transform people's mental and physical health".
The disease may be mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic at some stages and symptoms like other common diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as a cold, will manifest themselves.
Mild cases usually improve within two weeks, but recovery in people with severe or acute illness may take three to six weeks.
Based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be among the risk groups for COVID-19; however, not much information is available about COVID-19.
In people with asthma, COVID-19 can quickly morph into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cause respiratory failure, shock infection or multi-organ failure.
Among the consequences associated with COVID-19 are infection, abnormal blood clotting and heart, kidney and liver failure.
Blood clotting abnormalities, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of people who were hospitalized due to COVID-19.
In about 20-30% of people with COVID-19, symptoms of increased liver enzyme secretion (transaminase) have been observed.
According to the same report, the average time interval between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were associated with bed rest.
However, in patients transferred to the ICU, the average time interval between admission and death was reported to be seven days.
A review of recent cases shows that the average time interval between onset of early symptoms and death was 14 days, although the full range of six to 41 days has been reported.
Studies by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China showed that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and 1.7% for women.
Tissue-lesionology tests of lung samples from deceased individuals indicated diffuse granular damage and cellular fibromyoxide secretions in both lungs.
Cytopathic viral changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
Each image was similar to a picture of a lung suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported in the report of the National Health Commission of China, increased levels of troponin or the occurrence of a heart attack were due to heart damage.
According to March data from the U.S., 89% of people admitted to hospital have a pre-existing condition; accessibility of medical resources and socio-economic status of the region also affect mortality rates.
Estimates of deaths from the disease vary due to regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
The small number of mild cases may cause overestimation of the fatality rate.
Of course, the fact that the deaths were the result of previous infections may mean that the ongoing mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers, compared to nonsmokers, are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require special care or diet.
A report by the Hong Kong Hospitals Administration pointed to a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from illness and the presence of signs of lung injury on a lung scan.
This condition may lead to special post-convalescence syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not clear whether a history of disease caused effective, long-term immunity in individuals who recovered from the disease.
Immunity, based on the pace of other coronaviruses, is tolerable but in some cases the test result for coronavirus infection in individuals recovered from COVID-19 has also been positive.
It is believed that these cases are due to the severity of an underlying infection and not a re-infection.
The assumption is that the virus is natural and of animal origin, through a secret infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the outbreak of this infection was almost entirely based on human-to-human transmission.
A review of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, which was published in January 2020 in The Lancet, traces the first case of symptom onset back to December 1, 2019.
The official WHO publication has announced the date of the first cases of the appearance of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
For the determination of mortality and morbidity statistics, a variety of criteria are usually used.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 that are subject to clinical diagnosis or epidemiological diagnosis without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 17, 2020, the global death rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This number varies from region to region. Other measures may include the CFR, which is the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease. The infectious mortality rate (IFR) is another measure that is the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) with the disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from the stage of infection to closure of the case.
Although not all infected individuals necessarily produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of infected individuals.
In the small village of 4,600 people Castiglione d'Adda, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Italy, 80 people (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by the Carnival festivals. Infection of young people led to a relatively lower mortality rate. However, some deaths from COVID-19 are not officially included in the category of deaths from the virus.
Meanwhile, the German healthcare system has maintained its efficiency.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, based on the evaluation of blood donors, may have produced antibodies.
69 confirmed cases (0.004% of the population) of deaths due to COVID-19 have been recorded.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies between women and men.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, higher mortality rates and morbidity rates in men were reported.
The highest risk of disease in men is above 50 years of age.The gap between women and men at 90 years of age is by no means complete.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The reasons for this sex difference are not clear but genetic and behavioral factors may be contributing.
Gender-based cognitive immunodeficiency differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and greater male prevalence of comorbid diseases such as hypertension, at a younger age than women may all contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not taken steps to collect gender-related data in the context of COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare staff, especially nurses, are female and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that COVID-19 has been chosen as the official name for the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, announced that CO is the nickname corona, VI is related to the virus, D is the disease abbreviation and 19 is related to the time of its first detection: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid referring to specific geographical locations (such as China), animal species or group of individuals, based on international naming proposals and with the aim of preventing labeling.The virus that causes COVID-19, coronavirus 2 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the titles COVID-19 virus and COVID-19 agent virus in official communications.
The disease and its causative virus are collectively called coronaviruses.
In the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the names "chronovirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus" were jointly given to the virus and the disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization considered 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as the temporary names for the disease.The names were chosen based on 2015 guidelines on avoiding the inclusion of place names for naming viruses and diseases.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers have moved to produce hygiene items such as nose swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital had a dire need for a medical device swap and the supplier could not supply it on time. as a result, a local startup took up reverse engineering and required production of 100 swaps per night.
After the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incomplete information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease took shape and spread rapidly in the online space.
Apparently the virus is transmitted from humans to some animals.
Studies to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens have been inconclusive.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing among government organizations, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) ran a "unit trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of the four existing antiviral combinations that are the most promising.
There is no vaccine yet, but various agencies are actively studying proposed vaccines.
Results from previous studies involving SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are currently under investigation.
First, researchers are perfectly capable of creating a viral vaccine.
The use of a virus, inactivated or dead, is aimed at preventing the development of an immune reaction in the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, single-subunit vaccines, is being pursued, with the goal of developing a vaccine that can make the immune system more susceptible to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research is based on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is linked to nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel method of vaccine preparation).
On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
Antigen-based development has been raised as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but there is room for debate in this regard.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were underway.
Seven clinical trials evaluated therapies previously approved for the treatment of malaria, of which four research designs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine can be pointed out.
Antiviral drugs subject to modified use are the subject of much Chinese research, the results of which are due to be announced by the end of April in a Phase III trial of remdesivir in several countries.
As of April 2020, a review of the dynamic clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and proposed drugs has been ongoing.Several antiviral drugs available for the treatment of COVID-19 are under review, of which remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta may be noted.
As of March 2020, there was inconclusive evidence about the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who were treated with over-the-counter remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 and its preliminary results were published.
Of course, the research community has been invited to critique these results.
The health authorities of Korea and China have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily intake of one gram, has declared that taking a double dose is very dangerous and may be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an authorization for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, with the advice of physicians treating individuals with COVID-19.In the 7th China version of the guidelines, the names interferon, ribavirin or omifenovir are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high-dose ribavirin is necessary to prevent the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory environment.
Nitasoxanide, after its low-concentration efficacy in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was proven, has been proposed for research in the human body.Studies have shown that the preparation of primary spike protein with serine protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin has major limitations that have prevented the medical community from accepting these therapies without review. oseltamivir does not inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been proven.
The cytokine storm may be one of the most severe of the later stages of COVID-19 symptoms.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine has anti-cytokine storm properties. The National Health Commission of China has included toqueleizumab in its treatment manual after a brief review.
After the use of the drug in people with severe disease showed positive results, it was placed in a nationwide non-randomized phase 2 trial in Italy.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, to counter this development, the car may be the cause of death in some infected individuals.
The FDA approved the receptor antagonist interloquin-6 in 2017 based on past case studies for the treatment of cytokine-release-resistant syndrome that is caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, no randomized, controlled evidence has been presented based on the efficacy of toqueleizumab for the treatment of CRS.
The transmission of pure and dense antibodies produced in the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it as a non-vaccination method with passive immunization is under investigation.
This strategy was tested for SARS and the results were inconclusive.
Viral neutralization is a possible mechanism of this process, according to which antibody-drug inactivation provides a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms, such as antigen-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also be effective.
Other types of passive antibody therapies, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are under investigation.
The production of purifying serum, which includes a portion of blood fluid taken from recovered individuals and contains specific antibodies to the virus, may be increased for faster development.
Diseases caused by the coronavirus, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, one of the doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died as a result of COVID-19 and after public information about the virus outbreak was made public.
