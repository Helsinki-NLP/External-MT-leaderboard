No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the paragraph on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted, as part of a novel of the criminal code.
The new arrangement, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected by the MPs in the second reading of the request for mitigation of penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for signing a allegedly detrimental gas purchase agreement with Russia.
The verdict is not yet final, and the appeal of the convicted will be heard in court in December.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and even in the West the process raised suspicion of the court’s bias.
The petition, Paragraph 365, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted to be removed from the criminal code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been needed to pass it.
The Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners have to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the customary law of the Sharia, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, you cut off your hand.
Women should also forget the thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, possible apostates are executed, and so on.
In the future, instead of a single dictator, the society of conflicting tribes will be united by the Qur’an.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would be hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable here.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen probably not the best, and variation would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
Their excuse may only be the fact that NATO air strikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? the West is not one of them.
We only took part in a shooting, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians dismantled themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without bringing any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the mountaineers get rid of one concern - namely the expulsion of the cruisers.
But will the mineral oil companies get the black gold at a ridiculous price even without occupation?
It is unlikely that the West can finally rightly boast of its selfishness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy the Shari'a representatives.
The beginning of a new crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical thunderstorm broke across Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France declining.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are now keeping an eye on not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and several other European countries released their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5% and France’s by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded greater growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecasted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP stagnated and, according to the Chief Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
The results are worse than analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analyst expectations.
The Greek economy shrunk by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
The yield on their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems.
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, there are votes that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for Euro
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualifying for 200 million
The football team had the most difficult task of the whole season.
Thanks to a well-developed goalkeeper Čech and a wonderful goal by Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advance from the home game and will once again not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech team also won in Montenegro 1:0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech and the hero of the day Jiráček and thus sold their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also, due to the precise defense game of the Czech team, they could put the Montenegrins under more pressure only in the second half.
The unlucky birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Also thanks to an outstanding Petr Čech, the Czech national team will participate in the European Championships next year, it is also pleasant that the domestic football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, there was a very intense football game.
Both teams combined long and so it was mainly played around the middle line.
In the second half, too, the pressure from the home team was absent and the large defeats in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
It was a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed at noon in front of the facility on Tuesday and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is being processed.
In doing so, they wanted to show that they are ready to protect their country’s nuclear program, even with their own lives if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed in front of the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack with the intention of paralyzing the Iranian nuclear program to the greatest extent possible, according to the Israeli press, the target would also be the nuclear enrichment facility in NATO from the center in Isfahan.
The menu of a fat addicted child: He doesn’t eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have proven - obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This once again shows how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had potatoes for dinner on the eve of the awareness campaign under the motto "Adiposity is not a coincidence."
Sport is not one of the favourite activities in families with small thicknesses, but it also affects the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent said their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the school year last year and involved almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the campaign "Adiposity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are key factors that are responsible for the frightening increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, led to eating five times a day, in the mode breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-dinner bread - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," one of the survey results says.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative little things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of students eat breakfast.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast for themselves.
The worst was the finding that one in ten families doesn’t have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that in families with overweight children, unhealthy potatoes are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sport, only less than half of their parents do – namely, only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own meal plans based on their appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is especially the high popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta was over poultry.
The children almost didn’t like peanuts at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the educational lecture "Adiposity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a marked shift in preferences toward the principles of healthy eating," is stated in the results of the project.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed chicken or fish as the main dish of the day much more often in the questionnaire and were willing to eat fewer snacks or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a little worn out that was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
At the very least I did not know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the dressing of problematic figures and a seminar on how "on the square" goes.
It should get worse.
The closer the exam comes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (no one man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
After all, that is most of us.
Some have a too short neck, the others have a too youthful figure without proper curves and again others are molly.
It is the job of the stylist to visually masquerade wide shoulders, extend the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a female type like Jennifer Lopez — with large buttocks, wide hips and narrow waist — beautifully and figuratively without making it look too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the jacket or the trousers really don’t fit, you should cut at least a piece by size.
You will not regret this, because well-seated clothes are simply inexpensive.
In such a tailor-made coat, one feels much better than in one of the bar, which always runs up and glides, stands in the waist, etc.
Young figures, in turn, can afford to wear clothes with wrinkles, bushes, applications, stickers or rafting.
With so much information and figure types, I’m glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that given the assigned homework it is almost impossible to accomplish.
Each of the students was awarded a celebrity, for which they should think out suitable outfits - day clothes and evening dresses.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the model style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I’m going to “dress” Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria’s Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because for me personally, that’s much better than wearing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred kilos lately (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are to be cut out from magazines or searched on the Internet, printed and then edited graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design should then be expressed.
It is also very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on figure types, was spicy by three visitors from the industry:
Designed by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, such as a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to squeeze the sleeve or neck up and immediately the whole look looks completely different.
“Play with it,” he emphasized.
But most of all, I found the following advice: “First you have to know the rules perfectly.”
“Only then can you hurt them,” said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we need to pawn all these teachings, what to combine with and why, even if you often get to see very different things in fashion magazines.
Not to mention fashion.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So for a fashion story of ten pages (say ten outfits), you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look very different than in reality.
All this must be considered when designing the outfit.
That image and style are sometimes half the success, Jan Pokorný confirmed.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not really brilliant singer, whose image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also, well-known personalities often think of this as money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something like what I look like is secondary).
And if someone of us is already styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to see with certainty that the bullshit press writes, the corresponding celebrity has gone up or down again, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday, not believing that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then "build up" the outfit.
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he stylizes and he must be a weaved psychologist.
Appreciate people without worshiping and standing up to their opinions.
“If any manager commands us to look at her closet and add beautiful pieces, then we can’t clean up the whole closet and say, ‘My God, that’s terrible.’
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend, what you can contribute to," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called “plate pocket” must include.
So such a bag that you press on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair removal scissors or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (thus helping the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips to tap the clothes in the back if they are too large (nuts or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing.
But so that we can not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe floor, let alone the outside.
We clinged and we clinged...
The scissors should not even touch the shoes so that they are not damaged.
So you really need to act skillfully.
Mario delighted me by praising my “creation” without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me now - dedicating yourself to styling at a professional level is not a child’s play.
Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Resignation
The initially careless ride becomes a routine ride to the early class by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant mistakes.
It was possible to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, but what use would it have if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before it came to the table, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension, and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the matched passages go out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you’re used to NFS, in the end, it’s a lot different than you expected.
Sure – potentially they’re pretty decent arcade races, but overall the game is crushed by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So, in fact, they are no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a in principle incomprehensible laziness of game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First introduced to the story, the main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the wheel with the task of being first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole host of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race takes place on a different track and that each stage takes place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You have no moment of the impression that the game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
Nothing worldwide.
But driving through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep snow landscape seem visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, unusual elements bring a little variation to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts sight.
In the mountains, however, you have to be careful not to be spilled by a avalanche.
At the same time, the individual races are well arranged.
Just a few, but they are enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
There is also the police who are trying to get involved in the whole matter.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about certain interactive animations where Jack runs away from somebody and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (specifically probably only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because so at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned among the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model moves in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, although it does not tear down trees, on the other hand, one could not claim it would be bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations must look elsewhere.
But for an action-laden race, the local driving model will continue to be quite good, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems arise only after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind, it is hard to expect that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea of how the car behaves before hitting any object, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: in the close overhaul or passing by oncoming cars, in some places one "stripes" the other car only easily, in other, almost identical situation one comes into the slide and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the car is going to rot.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter, but it is always annoying.
The restarts are resolved in this way: if you have total damage or land far from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
In each race, you only have five restarts.
Once you have exhausted them, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool in case something fails, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes even restarting doesn’t help, as it helps nothing but to learn the critical section from the head.
Very unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, must be done in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
In other places, you will always encounter “civil” cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing by two opposing cars in front of a player, but before you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
Contractors have other advantages.
Thro the game there are a few places where you will always be overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again regardless of the time.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge, which happens in opposite direction.
The contractor must obviously get out of here.
And if he is already in front of one, then he naturally takes a sight, so that you initially drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Clearly – you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly loses you the pleasure of the game.
And that is a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining overall and sometimes so action-laden that you almost no longer know where one’s head is.
And in principle it doesn't matter what "blame" is about it - the concept of fifty unique routes, arranging the races in a way that can't get bored, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the race.
You should not ignore the gas stations on the route, because it is here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have right now is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are good for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story goes also the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points to earn for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To get to the higher driver level, various objects must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also connected with the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your own results with those of other players and also provides additional collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible scratches is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you run on the rails in the dark (because of me).
On the Tacho numbers look between 150 and 200 km / h (in my opinion), but there suddenly comes from behind a subway and drives an uncompromising waste.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout by the game makers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
Even more annoying is the fact that in some exciting moments the image repeat rate becomes slower and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, especially affects accidents with a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is not useful anyway.
The sound is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach as many young audiences as possible, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? the feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn’t shrunk by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the brunt of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
The game seems somehow unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared to face these mistakes with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Saten Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Charles University
The Festa Academica Festival now offers for the third time the celebration of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samtenen Revolution and this together with a musical experience.
During the festival, twenty professional and university choirs will present themselves.
The focus of the festival is the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
“The University of Charles has a large share of the festival.”
"Among the participants is also represented the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities, and in the festival committee, among others, also the Rector Václav Hampl," said the head of the organizing team, Jakub Čaloun.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of vocational school choirs, which will take place on November 17 from 14:00 on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the prominent Czech jazz artist Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours, in the galleries of the People's House in Vinohrady, the concert "Students of the Saten Revolution" (Studenty sametu) will take place, which will also feature university choirs, not excluded choirs of the University of Charles.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the World Student Day with dignity and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Seed Revolution, but also to present choir music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative collaboration of young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes-Kepler Gymnasium.
The patronage of the entire event was assumed by Bohuslav Svoboda, mayor of the capital Prague, and Václav Hampl, rector of the University of Charles.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festival concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happanings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the festival’s website www.festaacademica.cz
Ambassador to the European Union Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance between the various institutions felt out of place."
I didn’t expect such a war to burn out.”
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth up and everyone to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto “understandably and openly about Europe” she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a comprehensible and comprehensible way that she could have envy so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the University of Charles.
Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was loud, he was too discreet - a gray official who wasn't grown up to such a role, but I have to say, it struck everyone's breath how well he took the matter.
He is a man who is able to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them and above all have clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as a response to the question: Who is it really – the European Union? what number should I call?", thus as an important step towards consensus and better readability of EU policy to countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil millers.
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs had managed the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership summit.
She described the fall of the government during the presidency as a major negativity that has severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is now full of hands to do.
In the words of the ambassador, not only at the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, the situation was quite hectic.
And the seven-year budget of the EU still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely due to the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors of the economy will be given priority, which countries will be more and which countries will be supported less – all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Comprehensible about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s horrible abbreviations, foreign words and expert jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know if you are really thinking about curly or round cucumbers and different sizes of bananas in Brussels or if someone is really trying to ban the quarges.
She would also like to use the EU soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are reputed to be eurosceptics, who perceive the negative side of the matter more than the positive.
What is even more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Polish or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the French next to me will think, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is this your V4 again?'
According to Ms. Vicenové, the EU in the future will expect especially tougher rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
Much more real than a “European Federation” she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone here.
“We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation.”
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should work together who want to, and those who don't want to stay quietly away."
“There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately results in a strong ‘Europe of different speeds’,” Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
The Brand Story:
IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to find a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, then this would probably be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
As he used to say, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became the brand name for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which IBM began to issue in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture carefully prepared by Watsen.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not shrink from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and even society over the course of our first century.
We hope to do even more over the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
A thoughtful system
As early as the 1930s, Watson provided social care to his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM employees, as one of the first American employees, had paid leave, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful remuneration system for the best innovators and merchants.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the outset – being one of the first companies in the world to abstain from any discrimination – and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced at the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been at IBM for thirty years, and so far she has held the position of Head of Operations, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been conducting so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations have grown.
No wonder – there are plenty of ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, there is a difference between being only present on the market or shaping it directly through that presence.
IBM - in the states familiarly called "Big Blue" because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible range of products – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most famous inventions are, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the discette.
With a stock market value of approximately $220 billion (market capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology company this year (even after Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The Look forward
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on moving forward, so you should not bind yourself emotionally to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leaving them again.
Unlike the rival Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
The largest share of IBM’s profits are services, with software and hardware accounting for one-fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware was the most represented with more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
IBM continues to make these investments after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time like a storm.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the midst of the global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM will survive the current crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM’s shares has risen by 120 percent since 2008, and the company’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed, only the values can’t.
This is why we can expect that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, the company IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was first adopted in 1924 as a trademark for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous card clocks for recording the beginning and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competitive company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader then even overshadowed the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas to this day, the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the manufacture and distribution of all types of machinery for trade - from sausage and cheese cutting machines to boxers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled its revenue to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair of the company for forty years before being replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA to direct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that defined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consultancy share of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high value added.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the "Smart Planet" concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform, which is designed to help traders drive the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says – now it’s over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) Darina still had the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now her patience is finally over and she has set clear rules for her next life.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová gave refuge to the singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably would not have even dreamed of how it went with her husband.
When Iveta, on her urge, went out and back to Říčany after thirty days, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running passport.
Rychytář doesn’t matter who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will surely not be welcomed at home with open arms.
“He’s the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, I’m not going to chase him out.”
"But not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties," she betrayed, but also said that she had already separated emotionally from him and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door to him, Josef cares with dignity so far.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I stay with Iveta, nothing changes.”
“My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that.”
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I talk quite normally, only we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (to the newspaper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her from doing so.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female impudents: what about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female impudents, then they will shake some promptly out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we have a few unsitten revisions that make men blow the blood in their veins?
Purchased
Does your husband accuse you of being shopping addicted?
Do you need to buy at least one Hader per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can there be a little more in the shops?
In this case, it is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping drive half under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman can’t wait to go through a clothing store in search of a well-seated top clothes and not try all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times you’ve told your husband you’d rather stay out.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
“Do you like me at all?”
Is it familiar to you somehow?
Yes to?
You are probably one of those women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men react allergically to it when their wife is constantly grumbling about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of discomfort, women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness first
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean the windows, wipe the tiles and dust, scratch the bathtub – and this at least twice a week.
Are you slandering with your partner because he again tramps on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you slander the children because the washing pool just torn is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room closet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this type of "deviance", then you should know that you should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life are not the first.
This immeasurable cloud of purity can ultimately also damage mutual relationships and, above all, the peace of mind in the family.
Stickled
“Dirty trousers come into the laundry basket.”
Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?
A wet towel is not simply thrown on the floor.
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don’t be surprised that will bring him to the palm.
Of course, this is not badly meant, they just want that everything has its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have needed to mock so much.
Rumor and Trash
Some women like to cheat and cheat, they are cheated behind their backs or even slandered or they make alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to talk about such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and nonsense in the camp.
Hand on the heart, it’s for all women.
But this is not to be confused with the roughest caliber, for whom nothing and nobody is sacred, who despise everyone in their surroundings and who represent a significant danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia win with their assists
Ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina in the Monday game of the NHL with two assists and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assists in the same game also recorded Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had prophesied a big evening for Giroux.
“Even before the game, I told him he’d get a hattrick today.”
I felt that somehow.”
"Sometimes such a feeling comes over," Jágr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech footprint".
Voráček won the puck behind the hurricane gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the defeat of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third then again belonged to the flyers.
Specifically the Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said.
“I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with such a ice hockey player as I did with him.”
“I am very pleased.”
“I’m cutting my game on me.”
“All these years in the NHL, my players have put their game on me and now the spit is turning around,” Jágr said.
Carolina made the game still a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who overcame himself from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in a surplus of two against one.
“Excellent Pronger still performed in our zone.”
"He grabbed the puck, I took the ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory brought Philadelphia to the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and left in the second-third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also defeated their leadership with an unlose in the penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the penalty shots was not turned by Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the points lost, the home team's coach probably hurt the high illness-related failure in the defensive - the game they only played with five defensive players to finish.
“That is bad.”
"We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
“But there is nothing that can be done, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“At each shift, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to counter.”
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec repelled thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed decisively to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the goals of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters took part.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the then-CSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, the travel agencies sold only trips to the socialist countries of the Eastern bloc, but only selected people were allowed to travel to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the Czechoslovak Republic wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered to travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or even stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter had not been long gone.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for leaving the West - was granted only to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
In fact, the Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dachas - a custom that continues to this day.
The 1989 Saten Revolution was followed by a travel revolution by the Czechs.
While until 1989 a vacation in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their overseas holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation to neighboring Western European countries was abolished, which triggered a huge wave of short visits especially to Vienna, Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough from their long trips to the West, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
Thus, Czech holidaymakers slept in tents in the park when traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money at the time for accommodation in a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of Czechs travelling abroad at the time was a suitcase packed with canned foods, beer and permanent sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists could finally freely buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and, as a result, average wages increased, which marked another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, the travel agencies began to regularly prepare travel by charter flights, which thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantitative discounts, made air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had currency-free payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-Saman" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been flying to distant sunny countries every year; this year, 12 exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
Every year, Czechs travel to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%), and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 per capita for a single vacation, including the cost at the resort.
The general assembly is looking for a new chairman - again a pat is threatening.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman, and it is threatening that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
So far, there is no agreement on which electoral procedure to be elected.
Without this, there is no possibility of a vote on the three potential successors.
Three players want to run Czech football – Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues at the time of his resignation to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarrels between the two chambers of the union broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the general assembly had come to the people's house in the Smíchov district of Prague in vain, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not just about the election itself.
In fact, it was not even possible to agree on who actually has the right to vote at the general assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, at least in part, agreement was reached, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which considers a representation on a plenipotentiary basis to be inappropriate.
However, the dispute over the electoral system continues.
The Executive Committee did not bring any clarity in the matter, because at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, nothing else is on the agenda in principle.
Even though the opinions about the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, what should be done in the third round to avoid a pat-situation?
"The dispute point concerns the question of whether to act in accordance with the statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice chairmen of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the management.
According to the statute model, the third round is won by the candidate who receives the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is allegedly willing to compromise that wins the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both houses.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner of this percentage of votes receives at least a two-thirds majority.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Maori side, which would find it best not to add the electoral order, but to vote according to a valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, although it is clear that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
“My wish is to be elected as far as possible according to the statute.”
"So that no nonsensical alternatives will be invented, as at the last general meeting," explained the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his opinions distinguished himself mainly from Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
“The possible qualification of the national team for today’s World Cup would help calm the minds.”
“When football rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater,” says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the regulations for their own purposes."
Therefore, a further blockade at the General Assembly is not excluded.”
"H, I hope that common sense will ultimately win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and so they were looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee yet to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is likely to be crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the split parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which will show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football team before the extraordinary general assembly, could have made a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not have engaged in the struggle for this top position at all.
“If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, we have not been able to find such an adept," Paclík told ČTK.
So the main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, that is, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general assembly.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
"I have spoken to some of the people in question personally."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
“Such views would have liked to change,” he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner County Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is seen behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at major meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta holds the position of chairman.
"With his victory, the current state of affairs would be preserved and it would not progress in Czech football at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would get the football twice as bad," Paclík stressed.
He also points out that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interrogations for investigation in a corruption case, but came out of Pelta without punishment.
“I don’t know what prestige a Pelta victory should bring to football.”
“And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclík, who sees his earlier statement, “he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes president,” but already sees something quieter.
If Paclík wins the election on Thursday, however, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same goes for another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the general assembly in October, which ended in a fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to.”
“He has great abilities.”
“I could imagine him as the head of the national team, for example.”
“But I don’t think he is able to lead the union as a manager.”
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," Paclík said, who in September caused excitement by being behind the dismissal of the arbitration committee with Luďěk Macela at the head, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims he feels grown up in the role of the chairman of the association.
And citing his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, which with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to some cultivation of it."
“To limit the influence of certain stakeholders, who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which leads to unpleasant situations,” said Paclík, who makes no hint of his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta leader Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities is to strengthen the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new president should devote himself to."
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to say clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FAČR must be “overparty”.
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
“That is not ideal.”
"But it doesn't make much sense to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR that would exclude a path situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Federation, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would work hard to ensure that the FAČR receives new statutes that in the future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the start.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday’s hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely decrease in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the raising of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general assembly and so wanted the two-month break to help him defend and present his ideas about the management of football in a broader context.
“People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“He feels it’s time for the association to be led by someone,” said the man, who is mainly affiliated with the Jablonec Club, but who also served for many years at Sparta and in the executive committee.
He also believes that he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that today’s problems with elections are caused by the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately, at the General Assembly in June, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the citizens’ association that he used as a means of seduction for the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take this personally and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
“That’s a principle that he can’t be without,” Pelta says.
Furthermore, he does not try to differentiate himself from his opponents.
He had already announced earlier that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his counterpart would be his first deputy.
Even Tomáš Paclík had not been attacked for a long time, who, in turn, did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been in football for over a year and can already indicate some achievements."
"His attacks, however, were degrading and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"This is why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he said in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes, to the national team.
This is the headline of Czech football.
I would also try to put an end to all affairs, from the cause of Bohemians to the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Just after that I would plunge into negotiations with the private and public sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the 46-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry at the top of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is obvious nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If the only point that is really controversial is how to vote in the third round, then we’ll get over it.”
"Football needs credibility and it will only win it back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially crucial day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him will begin to work hard
If former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new Chairman of the Czech Football Federation at the General Assembly on Thursday, this would supposedly disturb many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his choice, one will begin to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee accountable for individual areas of football.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Hašek started.
"As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through the national team, professional football, to performance football for the youth.”
"I do not mean that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl told ČTK.
"I'm a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute tough tasks so that football progresses milestones in every segment.”
Many would not be delighted with this because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard on themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement has considered not running at all anymore.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don’t constantly throw clutches between my legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation for why he hesitated.
“A lot of people told me I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others would do so.”
“That is trust that cannot be wasted,” he said.
It is also supposed to motivate him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a lot of work and I don't want to throw it away."
"Processes have been launched, which will probably not come into effect in a few years, and I would not like to see anyone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic approach and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mostly people who would make football so that it would only be for the selected."
You can accuse me of some things, but not that I am partisan.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone because it’s good for everyone and not just the selected,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is just a president of the Czechs.
"Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do my best for mornings."
"For example, it is time to consider whether we should not divide the league into a Czech and a Maori part, whose winners then each move up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravian," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Club, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the struggle for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech House, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, the agreement on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for not pulling on a single string.
While he says of Pelta that “he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football regain confidence,” he considers the second rival – Paclík – a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and also the staffing in the committees he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would not want to turn things in his favour," Rajchl judges about his rivals.
The most beautiful Poles in Europe
jumping into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike rest their tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on research trips in the past year and a half, one thing was not missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she stared high into artistically designed domes, she swam in front of marble pads waiting for her on the edge of the basin, and marveled at the crisply restored youth-style swimming halls.
If she liked a bathroom, she took it into her notebook – along with knowledgeable details about the building’s construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by architectural historian Meder – and they are now presented in her newly published book “Badefreuden”: Folkschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, “Hardcore-Betonbauten” in the Taunus.
She travelled through 13 countries on her “travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe”: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland – and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia each.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, Meder says - only in the water is different.
Just annoying, swimming fans have to get along with blue tiles and chlorine stoves, while joggers can breathe in the enchanting smell of fishing forests or listen to cheerful bird jokes in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Viennese Meder.
“So I started collecting beautiful baths.”
Water surface doubles architecture
Plains in the swimming pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so great, because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have given themselves effort, swimming halls can be a real eye-catch: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in the bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high voices, colorful tiles, jumpboards.
The small-format photo band "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of knowledgeable information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it makes the desire for a jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a native karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottled building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have an eye on the whole city from the Zurich rooftop, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a swimming pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the drift on the ski slope.
Per the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimming guests in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three upward open shells, it evaporates in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in his nose.
Many thermal baths smell sulfur, in the Árpád-Bad in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so strongly for heating oil that you can hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline hydrogen-carbonated healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to one’s skin as soon as one slips into the basin – a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbath in the Czech Luhatschowitz bath, she found a secluded terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
As Meder looked through the winding windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
The degradation, on the other hand, has been countered in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three construction phases are already behind this bathroom; you can discover not only neoroman elements dating back to the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of the swimming pool expert Iris Meder – and not only because she originated in the Black Forest.
“It’s an achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a secondary matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank launches commodity business
by Christian Teevs
Will Deutsche Bank stop its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the company will take the consequences.
and Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global commodity exchanges is driving prices up – and the banks are therefore co-guilty of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the Zocker have disconnected from supply and demand – and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business is “worthy of putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then announce what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade, or even a complete withdrawal.
Ackermann shares his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: “Betting on rising food prices shows drastically how ruthlessly banks are damaging the public good today.”
Ackermann is now in duty as the chief bank lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is talking about hungry people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Officer will not move into the Supervisory Board other than planned.
By moving away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses, he hardly needs to shave himself - it would ultimately have to do with his successor.
One in two would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 percent believe it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also suffer personal consequences if they learned that their bank is engaged in such transactions: one in two would cancel all investments where money flows into commodity speculation, according to the survey.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account and moving to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The Moving Flag
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ends: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and went away.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition house.
If shrouded by modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a bowl-like side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was set up in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Southern Railway Station after the World Exhibition, was rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century was opened in it - the "20th House" was called.
However, the building was not suitable spatially and technically as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new home.
Since 2001, the building was empty and went down more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens its first exhibition - a lucky case in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a Ph.D. art historian with a remarkable career, including in her youth as a ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modernity, insisted on the reformation among politicians and heritage defenders, she raised public funds and private sponsorship funds and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore were to be built, and an office house was to be built for it.
Strict supervision, small staff
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensibly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "extremely important place" where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and ease when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
There were far greater problems with the current reconstruction: the building was “an energy shuttle,” Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, insulating glass reinforced by glass fiber was used and the glass roof was replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements made room for the new use, a lowered light graft between the house and the street provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red brown rust-protective shade.
The cinema is exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the Monument Authority and with a small mandate.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Monument Protection Office," Krischanitz says, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and reconstructions, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city story.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "wake up a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban accident: around the Swiss garden the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofquartier", with office and residential buildings, is being created.
And another fortune may happen: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporäre Kunsthalle, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood site in the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has unveiled a crisis plan to prevent traction failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and railway networks even in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external staff for snow removal on railway plants and stairs to 16,000 people.
The goal is to get rid of snow and ice on the sidewalks before they start operating and 90 percent of the operational areas within four to five hours.
Two months ago, after a summit with the government and industry, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter as well.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making for years that it has to have the axes of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank to pay millions in U.S. fines
After the tumult over chief Josef Ackermann comes new discomfort from the United States: Deutsche Bank must pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also getting his past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison $145 million (106 million euros) to resolve disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
The sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of seducing co-operative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such securities lost greatly in value during the financial crisis and scratched the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the reception of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Co-operative Banks and jumps into bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to compensate for the billions of dollars in damage.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also struck other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
These mortgage securities are called mortgage-backed securities.
These are home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble set in 2007, this became the fate of a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events have been several years ago, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and regulators have engaged in countless lawsuits to obtain compensation or punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overriding two U.S. state-owned real estate funders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals of around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit against the FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurter be held accountable for "substantial losses", without however naming an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands and said it was willing to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM for $10 billion
Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought up shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, because the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightshot in the financial world.
As a result, IBM can now be called “Sir IBM.”
Buffett revealed on CNBC that he has bought $10.7 billion in IBM shares since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus grown into one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had provided decent profits.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as operating data centers.
The more than 100 year old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy as well as powerful corporate computers.
Buffett has so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett resorted to a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer, or a machinery maker.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to about 80 own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
His lifestyle is modest.
He is a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock rose by 1 percent.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion in stock markets, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he does not want to enter.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born men and one Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing background.
This news is being reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a ghost that has long been believed dead returns: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The existence of foreign hostility in Germany has never been questioned.
The uncovered right-wing extremist network, however, reveals scales whose dimensions are far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" was the title of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly: it commemorated the victims of racist violence with a warning guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish employment agreement.
In joyful colors, it was staged together - as a success story.
The reporting of some Turkish media: "Gift of Germany for the Fifty" is the headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot take this thoughtful connection.
"It begins to stink," says the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people have been murdered, who have paid taxes and with their work have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critically discussed in German Turkish internet forums the actions of the police and their subsequent success in the search.
Why the German authorities did not come to mind much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some of them are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: “If the migrants continue to be slammed here, they have nothing but self-defense and arms.”
This will be the best self-defense.”
"From the kindness of the enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made clear.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can turn into right-wing force.
However, the attacks sharpened the sentiment on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was mostly grieved at the time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral ceremony in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks has been in the country’s rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts to enlarge and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slid from one crisis to the next.
Let a German rule it.
Axel Weber did not think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on a equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss bank UBS – an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and made friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
“UBS has made the turnaround.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
In September, however, it became clear that everything was going to be different.
A dealer of UBS in London had circumvented all of the bank’s security systems and stolen around €1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland renowned banker, was forced to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has since also been seen as attacked - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the board of directors already in May – not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and central banking, and would have needed some time to work.
With one blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it deserves the title of “Europe’s biggest scandal bank.”
Because, on the one hand, UBS is huge – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and on the other hand, it has been gliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing seems to be saved by the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also exploited Swiss asset manager had combined her with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a huge figure in investment banking as well.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it was advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, tells us: “To my students I always set the UBS as a model for a good bank at that time.”
From today’s perspective, one asks, “How could I be so wrong?”
He made a great mistake.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something properly slipped in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, he understood why he had left.
The bank’s investment party had filled itself with subprime securities and had to write down billions.
To counter this, UBS announced a capital increase of sage and signs 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but those over whom some would have rubbed their nose until recently: an untransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so hidden that one did not even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in 2008.
The bank was forced to announce new billion-dollar losses, with Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, who was still the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigning.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was before collapse in the face of its misinvestments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank purchased UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced conversion loan, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shocked – because they noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“Once again, we couldn’t save the UBS,” says banking researcher Geiger.
To the first disaster came the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in its tax dispute with the United States and agreed to disclose the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million – as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions, along with a penalty.
Thus, UBS more or less openly admitted to having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
The resignation of the chairman and chairman of the board of directors followed.
Exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in two core business areas: in investment banking through misspeculation and in asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it back, then this unfortunate trader story follows: A single trader swept 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is slipping.
And it becomes apparent: with risk management in investment banking, it is obviously still not working.
"With the case of Adoboli, one has had to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
Even the financial board of a major German bank is confident: “The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control.”
It had been precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago embarked on becoming guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, for that security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic, if the world collapsed.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli had become for especially noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of the prosperous Swiss private bank – it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to the Lake Zürich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, and shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany’s can be found here among traditional Swiss shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank through the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS can be entered through a heavy turning door.
Inside, the walls are carved in marble, in front of which there are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large sign of "Safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has been superseded by both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or betray, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspapers, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS has become much too big, he finds – especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say.
“And if so, they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.”
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first brought its high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-nation decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, were granted by the politicians to save the bankrupt big bank.
How could this happen?
Speaking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into one giant group.
A bank was created that was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and continued to grow.
UBS’s two different predecessor banks complemented each other: a wealthy but dormant bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized one.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came in favorably with a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the high-intellectual, the modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked from banking to the top.”
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: “He thought his models were the reality,” says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragically maybe.
Supremacy came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeatedly uttered the same slogan: Goldman Sachs kick off the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That’s what UBS wanted to do at the top.
A few steps have already been taken.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played a top role.
Business consultants who were hired, however, highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge gap from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close that gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a pre-established hedge fund invested in American subprime investments.
It evolved into a huge machine that packaged and extended securities into American mortgages, but also retained risks.
Other banks have long sought to exit.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it there,” says banking expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to go when attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than thought.
Posts at UBS have become the headquarters and are still blurred to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go so far.
But the investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually meant only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has made his best: he is to permanently manage the business of UBS, the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3,500 jobs will be removed.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber must be asking himself now.
So far, he has only said publicly that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.

Fear of recession in Europe hurts U.S. stocks
The threatening recession in Europe has taken away the courage of U.S. investors at the very beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unsuccessful.
The decline in industrial production on the continent stifled the hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis.
The general relief from the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass were still half full last week, not half empty – but now the problems were pushing back to the forefront, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Mainly financial values were on the sales tables.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values noted at trading closure with a drop of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trading, the market barometer ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The wider S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The index of the technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a drop of 1.2% at 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 eurozone countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the recovery.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to the statistical office Eurostat.
“We are not an island, we are dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and stepped into the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and made it initially listed just one percent higher against the trend in the trading history.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell by 2.6% significantly stronger than the market.

719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread across cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts say.
Some of them like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the city for centuries, but in many municipalities local people complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy for the “problem birds” is not yet in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be taken out of the cities, experts said at the first crows symposium in the eastern Friesian wilderness.
There, experts from all over the federal territory advise on possible ways out.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservatives also attributed the problems in cities to the exodus of the specially protected seed crops: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the falling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crabs are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist, among others, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crabs in the district had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described catching the animals in bird traps and beating them with knives as brutal.
“The normal displacement, the grinding, is of no use,” said urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Spotting nests with water or falling trees often has unwanted consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals are escaping, large colonies are dividing and spreading elsewhere.”
Grinding can only be imagined as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away.”
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer said.
It is possible to think of a combination of grinding the animals from sensitive living areas and lock offerings to resettle them elsewhere.
In contrast, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advocated a completely different treatment of animals: "A pimple in the face we can ultimately best endure confidently."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, where signs inform about the life of highly intelligent seed cows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Also to criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed cows not only use tools to get a snack, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows the extent to which the birds are intelligent.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse with stones in order to get to a moth larvae.
Without much training, they realized the size and shape a stone needs to have in order for the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the crazy crabs then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically mounted cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
The birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them pieces of wire.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then pinched the bucket at the handle from the pipe.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in this.
Cristiano Ronaldo to play for Portugal in 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup were lost.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sold the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8,53), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive EM participation perfect after the 0:0 out of play.
The Czechs received a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off retreat with outsiders Montenegro after the finish (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Nothing more burned up even Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored the next goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed handset (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already defeated Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a kick off.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to early lead in the masks.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his broad shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City placed a head ball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek plays for Czech Republic
Then the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the center.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on swallow and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other side, Stark gave a controversial handle after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic safely transformed.
However, after the break, the 2004 vice-European champion made everything clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European champion from 1976 runs to the European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to survive a second of horror in the initial phase.
Finisher Petr Cech prevented a possible owner door by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflection at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn from the penalty limit just past the goal of Cech.
After the break, the cross line had to be saved for the already beaten world-class defender of the Czechs, again the attacker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50).
Shortly before the end, everything was clear.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get over a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost sure to clear his place on the bench of the third World Cup of 2002, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM round.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost had a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan only hit the posters with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim also could not sink the shooter in the goal.
However, in the aftermath of the horror second, Croatia increasingly took control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made the place for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in play.
Trapattoni goes to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Cup in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the start, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57) was the same for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian back team prevented the possible leading hit.
It was in the 32nd minute.
After an accidental defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP plans to double employment in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software manufacturer, is investing billions in China over the next few years and plans to double the number of employees in the country.

“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Empathic and generous, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror. A History of the First World War, told in nineteen destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that comes to one's heart.
Here’s a tip on how to do this: Cut out this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in England’s romantic narrative.And these main characters will act as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you, like England’s men and women, are lost in the mist of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which nominates the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book, which he does not mistakenly describe as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather “a book about how it was.”
"Beauty and Horror" almost combines the war experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Englund’s book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Horror" travels with expert views over other war spots: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book falls baskets of bees, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Chechen flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
War is flooding the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like cordy.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance.
Who comes at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
"The missing facts," notes Englund, "were filled with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individual characters such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely vivid in the englunds of the accumulation of small moments losing in detail.
Many of them act from lack and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: “Replacement, everywhere replacement.”
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false wiping rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He talks about replacement food in Germany.
He describes “meat made from pressed rice and baked in hammer fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes dried with wood.”
There were, as he noted, “837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of war: "You feel that, despite all, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in a chair of bed, with the evening newspaper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and acting as if such a facade meant civilization, and as if there was no barbarism behind one's own strengthened and confiscated shirt chest."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or care about it.
“If you take away from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as terrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new types of terror.
“The conflict became increasingly an economic competition,” writes Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the Bestiarium of the Young Century”: “the word-converted and ideologically-convinced mass murderer in measurement suit who slaughteres while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unexpected ways, and there is as frivol behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade of gonococcal pus, as soldiers bought and lubricated on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate shouted him in the eyes, which resulted in them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet intrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war “unusually unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englunds Band joins an unconventional Hall of Fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I’ve ever read in a book.
I do not give it here anymore.
But it’s as if he had taken this page with the main characters from our nose with his book and set it on fire with a rod.
After an early failure, a minutiously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time there are few people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed.All others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence highlighted the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the desertion and gave the occupants a huge increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to repeat.
And so the police operation to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials intensified the so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came “in the last minute,” said someone familiar with the commands, who spoke for a declaration as “exercise.”
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then stepped back as hundreds of protesters gathered after hearing about the plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including operational commands from all over the city – hundreds of mobile officials typically deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people go in and out of the park throughout the day, almost like pendlers, so 1am at night is a good time to go in.
“It was reasonable to do this when the least number of people stayed in the park,” he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lights and speakers stood in front of the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages that sounded from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials in their bright blue wind jackets entered the park, many protesters simply picked up their things and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 p.m. to give protesters time to pack their possessions.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene if arrests in the park were needed.
Journalists were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said it was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim they wanted to prevent them from watching the police action in the park, and they said the handling of the officials was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said television cars in Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
As the police moved westward through the big mess of protesters’ personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags of clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, removing what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were dragged out, and photos of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A major nucleus of protesters took position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp bonded together in their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster protection officers were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were due to "inappropriate behavior and resistance to an arrest."
The most prominent official on the spot was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “did not lead the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were erected.
From these locations, police could be observed expanding the circle around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were observed pushing people out.
About 28 people were in the northern district.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 o’clock south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of wood.
Eventually, an officer and a demonstrator arrived at the hospital.
Trade union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school caregivers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the dismissals are unnecessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on schools teaching poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option that the trade union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid employees who lost their jobs in a chess march on October 7 described the trade union leader as political revenge for last year’s denial to the city of access to a health fundined by the working groups to close the budget gap.
These allegations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing in the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the dismissals were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the city council shot back and explained to him that nothing in the budget specified that school aid staff would be fired.
37 City Council officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a lawsuit on Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City’s Ministry of Education as accused and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Justice Department, said the city did not file the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft lawsuit presented by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit for inequality.
It shows that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and few dismissals in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants were dismissed in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Constating the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed at Harlem’s 36 public school, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: “This is not a neighborhood of oppressed parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts.”
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year.In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo approving the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word “excess” to describe the plot, although “excess” in the U.S. typically describes a teacher’s shift from a school’s payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the headquarters.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred," the draft lawsuit says.
Congress ready to negotiate on Libya
Ultimately, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already negotiating on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the uprising, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations adopted a resolution under President John Kerry (Massachusset) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun the reconstruction of their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both sides and the White House disputed the word choice of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a wide margin of both parties and there was no vote.
In addition, the House passed a decision to cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative fist—with a Congress angry enough to criticize Obama’s conduct as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now, the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation and praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures get the full support of the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide lawmakers, as the June Act did?
The last version encounters resistance from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee’s top Republican.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to vote, although they have tried enough often.
Goodlate’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and covers a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others only slightly deviate from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients—especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their resume—the opportunity to boast of having “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance sheet.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limit to two presidential terms.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
An amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage, just like an amendment that prohibits burning flags, is an ever-recurring pattern.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eagerly as the members propose changes, the unevenly faster they move as in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added—the 27th—was ratified in 1992, but was actually already proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Struck but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after a near-range gunman shot her during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night.
When she appeared alongside Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20/20", she cried for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage caused by the ball that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly vote for the debt barrier.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, “That’s fine.”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special recorded shortly before the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope," was released.
The special follows Gifford’s recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with her bald shaved head and a long shell over her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A sneeze with the head.
A shake with the lips.
And then, their first words: “What.”
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast."
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: you can see the congressman singing alongside therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Giffords a newspaper article on the assassination on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly treated while waiting for his trial.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
“Hard, hard and hard.”
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I was hit."
“So I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t defeated?’” said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you will go through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
They feel more compassion than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and female soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed, among others, by Chief of Staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced as orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I think the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn’t respect, really not.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are suffering people in uniform.
“We were by no means victims,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of supporting is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that hit the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion take place in silence and in private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “irritated, violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took on a prominent post in Washington after his return, said.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the struggle.
“If you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions from it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of military ease is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely taken for praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was usual in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a civil servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to struggle with rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before a military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer with her.
He asked if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
“My alarm bells were ringing,” Lyman said.
But the Texas woman wiped her concerns aside.
I thought, “Oh, he is 19.
He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I wish I had listened to my stomach feeling.”
A few minutes after they walked into Lyman’s room, the man stood behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are waiting anxiously for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia to decide whether a lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not act against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 applicants, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide adequate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is pursuing top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically structured,” she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says she has contacted 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of putting their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a request to reject the lawsuit.
The court files available to Newsweek detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries caused to soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the applicants," the document says.
The Defense Ministry has refused to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contacting indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four leading military academies for allegedly promoting a female-hateful atmosphere.
Despite this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is gathering a lawsuit against the military focusing on the "personality disorder" diagnosis rape victims received in order to dismiss them from service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of its discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits for individuals who claim to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were independently submitted to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office 3,158 cases of sexual abuse.
But most abuses are not at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases occurring each year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military were brought to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, she the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and her assailant’s blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was questioned by a judge.During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman said.
"I thought the labor would start. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
“They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I got out again, I said to my commander, ‘That wasn’t his procedure.’
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed in a disgraceful manner, so she did not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other applicants progresses is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, “In my opinion, you should move forward.”
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first challenged.
I have been a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability brings.
He adds, “The odds are against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t follow its way, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who posted their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to committing a July shooting in Norway that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the page’s advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million supporters of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking themselves to a new band or diet product, the adds invited users to a survey in which they were asked about their educational status, attitude toward violence, and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without having to leave their offices.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” says Bartlett.
Online supporters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and upset about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factory, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as “likes”, text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom that has led to the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title increasing by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beautiful thing about Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people you don’t normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you previously tried to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them access,” says Bartlett.
“At Facebook, it all goes away – you go straight to them.”
Others say the site provides a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their bullying on Facebook are significantly more inclined to problem drinking than students who remain silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that peer-to-peer students, such as housing consultants, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem unless you’ve recognized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly wipes up the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has generated statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voting participation in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using data that only Facebook has access to – masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data mine available to others for research purposes.)
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not.In order to play scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to disclose their own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know anything about yet?
While researchers have strictly defined policies on how to collect their data offline, everything online is allowed.
"I don't think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles at all," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
“As for her, it was just about her and her friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and pen is still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still taking place offline.”
"Cold and Inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a “resistance” fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and a Norwegian Temple Knight," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the laws, but I do not acknowledge guilt.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who delivered a pre-written speech, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he remains behind Castle and Riegel.
Everyone took part with the goal of getting everything out of place.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and appeared quiet and professional throughout the hearing. He looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre indication that he would be part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may seem to some that the attacks of July 22 appeared to have been the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically relieve the sorrow and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” one of the victims’ relatives said.
“It would be so much easier if he did it.”
7 Lessons From The Interview With The Dead Steve Jobs Showed In A Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technology genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most insightful in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week before special film shows in the major markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an avid organizer who was eager to craft charts—a man who believed that many executives suffer from “a disease of thought,” “that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the rise of the personal computer. And he sat together with jobs for more than an hour, during which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in expert idiots, he says the copy templates of the interview were missing at delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating detailed interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer – 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, during which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatient to respond to Cringely’s questions and pushes him to move faster into topics or side-actions of greater importance.
Captured before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems somehow terribly far-reaching when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right or wrong in his opinion and presents his own vision of the future of the computer.
But seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the leap to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How to Learn to Run a Business:
“Over the years in business, I’ve always asked, “Why do you do things?” and the answer you always get is, “Oh, that’s how it’s done.”
No one knows why he does what he does, no one in the business really thinks about things in depth.
I have found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded – mostly starting with “standard costs” quantified to mere guess and then adjusted with “deviation” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the least.
How the Pope became acclaimed:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could get into the telephone company and make remote calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while crawling through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you scratched the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door,” Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we were able to build that little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without them.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious stroke that Wozniak and he took off when they called through the Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP employees visiting the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang onto that machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovation:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed a few plates, he was asked by a client to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember overwhelming arguments... They shouted to me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15.
Large companies that are down:
Long before bringing Apple back to life, Jobs predicted the ways in which so many industrial giants collapsed with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you’re making a better copier or printer, well and?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are those people] who ultimately lead the business and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eradicated by people who have no concept of good products versus bad products – craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened to Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger if it had been the Microsoft of the 1990s.
You caught the defeat by victory.
Innovation as an Art Form:
“There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make concordances, certain things you can’t do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together.
Ultimately, it’s about taste, it’s about trying to get rid of the best things people have created and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would have done fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner With Opponents of Health Laws As Court Adopts Case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the chancellor that the case would be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a slogan among conservative activists across the United States.
In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to trigger the 2012 presidential struggle, which is likely to be in full swing at the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be broken is probably Paul Clement, once attorney general under George W. Bush’s administration.
Clement’s office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of two dozen companies supporting the annual Dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the trial.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel hours after the court ruled the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican party in the Senate and a declared opponent of healthcare reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charitable events of the law and other organizations, with the judge not being a speaker, honorary guest, or according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the agencies involved in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this, was enough to alarm moral and government activists.
"This astonishing breach with morality and the contradiction with the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lies, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings in court."
Your appearance and support of a donation campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they would mix court affairs too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan does not make any facilities to do this.
Boeing pulls record $18 trillion order to land
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more.
In addition, Boeing is selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order of over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft total at a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its largest commercial aircraft order ever, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-wheeled Boeing 777 jets.
The order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show in 2011 that it has an option to purchase another 20 aircraft, raising the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“That’s absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, a Morningstar stock exchange expert.
“The quality of these special customers is very high.”
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually hurts airlines as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns on a higher oil price.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural security,” he said.
Emirates’ order reaffirms Boeing’s leadership position in the large-scale aircraft market and helps to keep Airbus’s rival SAS in check, which is attacking the superiority with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350 to compete directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher load and range.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims drug traffickers supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor’s post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the post of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for governor posts in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied electoral cabins, built street blockades ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI].”
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and winning in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beat Claderon, who had still led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the divided and unlucky left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the findings.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates have left the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, “I think this victory will make us look courageously into the next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downturn that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the monetary bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "passionately" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support from European leadership and European resources by Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in the same boat.”
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune.”
So if China and India can help, then by all means.”
The European Monetary Union has been in a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for emerging market leaders to unite to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag predicted that any aid to Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said mutual agreements — such as the purchase of bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) — would give European partners in Asia greater negotiating power.
India’s trade minister, Anand Sharma, said India “will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone as its economy is now suffering from declining exports and the depletion of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
"It's not an option, it's a mission, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India to Europe, of whom more than 800 million live on $2 or less a day.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend their holidays on the beach.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public servants in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, losing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia for 2011 now threatens the “risk of degradation” due to the imminent threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their vocabulary.
Pentagon warns of possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain response from the Pentagon halls to the war spots in Afghanistan and civilian streams.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress fails to reach a deal on spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% overall cuts, as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a reckless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel, and since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to relocate civilians with limited probability in order to reach the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert readiness.”
The cuts ultimately hit the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime counter-terrorist contingents are not directly affected by the seizure, serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personnel appointments were being cut down, which would lead to delays in the appointments and the hiring supervision that supports the war."
“Personnel salaries would be cut, resulting in late payments to war dealers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequences of seizing the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon as they published Panetta's letter.
“This is a result we can’t live with, and it’s not one that should be imposed on us.”
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings from senators will increase the pressure to compromise the budget or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly expressed the potential cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a dark picture of what could be ahead - a military with shell but without nucleus.
“It is a ship without sailors.”
“It is a brigade without ammunition.”
“It’s an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots.”
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
“It’s an armed force that lacks morality and readiness and is unable to confront potential opponents.”
“It really makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions “create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disasters, serious restrictions on our global operational and intervention capabilities, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to abolition, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but advocates say it is an important next step towards upgrading so that potential threats from China and other enemies can be blocked.
How to reveal a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how questionable and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy becoming the master of the allegations of sexual harassment by several women.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of meadows because it allegedly held back reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself foolish when he circulated denials that were very quickly disproved by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violating campaign funding, linked to covering up an extra-marital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it will forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers predicted the exam answers to their students so that they could be good at their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies have shown that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered urgent lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important to learn for every person, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as charades in which the goal is to call “Have you!” the enthusiasm of a deception is a reputable field of knowledge based on scientific data gathered over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have carried out extensive research projects, in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the ancient myths about lies have been uncovered.
Lies look in the eyes.
They stumble, stumble, red and stumble not always.
However, it should not be concluded that these liars are difficult to uncover and uncover.
A trained liar detector can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the subtle facial expressions, questioning and timing.
I have spent several years exploring the scientific findings of the extensive and ever-growing field of detection.And it is clear that the detachment of a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find judgment in our complex world, especially when hiring or interrogating people or negotiating or administering is part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at evaluating other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to open up “self-oriented” lies than women whose lies are more “to-other” – usually they want to protect the feelings of others – that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly “fat lies”).
We also know that when a person is exposed as a perpetrator, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the posture, laughter, voice quality of your subject.
You should better know when someone normally trips with the foot constantly so that they don’t wrongly blame him if he trips with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of a decay.
People who cheat may stiffen when they try to remember their story.Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the adjustment conversation", that deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questionnaires often erroneously signal that a job interview is over just to keep looking for that relaxation after the job interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson’s glider is famous for using the past form when he claimed his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Misleading individuals can also use a distancing language: “I didn’t have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky” or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use “qualifying language” when answering a tricky question: “Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience.”
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, often causing the alarm bells to whistle.
There is no magic remedy to detach lies, but you can learn skills that make detachment possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone is less likely to become a victim of fraud, both in personal and professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Revised After Threatened by Delayed U.S. License
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, irritating trade unions and at the same time reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to redesign the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will redirect the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, though with a different course.
This came after a State Department announcement last week that a decision on a federal authorisation for the project would be postponed until the new possible course to avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply, has been reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Foreign Ministry may postpone a decision until 2013, after elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was the responsibility of the Foreign Ministry and acknowledged his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline connected Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six countries.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, opposed to the plan, are weighing down the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s recent Environmental Impact Study has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source says the ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s 2008 adviser, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing a baby to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle had gotten a tinnitus attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would have scared her little daughter so much that she surrendered to fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so scared that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her on her arm again," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angrily.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She became angry and began to blaspheme—she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud.
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started kicking water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle stumbled upon her mother, who still wore Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and dragged to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby cried so much that it had to surrender, she said.
The family later apologized to LaBelle in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified compensation, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he doesn’t charge fees and the family plans the money she gets will donate to child cancer aid.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is presented to a kindergarten woman carrying a 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change is slowing the economy
In the first year Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and sparked great hopes regarding economic growth, is in the government.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also tightened the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter This is mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a braking effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report on the effects of the frost, published by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78,03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21,07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has caused unemployment to continue to rise in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid rise in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa were unemployed, equivalent to 4,53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. This is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), commented that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including losses of liquidity in the market due to fund cuts by legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them, or use them for anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also an inherent demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased.This is due, on the one hand, to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too.These people stay here and look for work here, which causes unemployment to rise,” he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is even more serious if you consider the high percentage of black labour, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of the country’s employees who work without paying to the social security funds.
Unemployment and black work include low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexican Government Agency for Labour and Social Welfare).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos as of September, which is much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years. According to the Secretaría de Economía (governmental economic authority), the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, primarily from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the economic crisis, in July, the state government applied to the National Congress for a loan of 3 000 000 000 Pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy.
Reactions
For representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of Mario López Valdés’s rule made the government’s inability obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexican State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry), stated that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the various sectors, including the state government.
“Economic activity in Sinaloa has really been very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well-defined government team have not been adequately coordinated,” he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year complicated and slowed the country’s economic development.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost.One of the main effects is a slowing economy that is not moving enough to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services.
Re-defining the call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, stated that the state must be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
There is a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will better guide the government’s efforts.
"Overall, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas.The economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
“There are areas in which you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively; what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work ahead of it,” he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic said the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
Pursuant to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military personnel while overseeing the Cipriano Valdez Street in front of Guard Station No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white car, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods have been handed over to the district judge and the convict is still in the enforcement office.
Debt for Construction Works
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programs are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the municipal authority for social development explained that although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now floating in danger as the state government has not paid the funds due, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state.
“They have to contribute 12 million dollars, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a portion in July,” he said.
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state failed to meet its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources.The programs continued and this year we had to raise the funds that the state had not used to participate in these programs," he explained.
Although the state authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was asked to speed up the administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Nearly 12 million they have to contribute, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
Court Approves Transition to Digital Television in Mexico for 2015
The shift from analog to digital signals is one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree requiring the switch from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 due to the lack of eight votes needed to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not obtain the required qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide whether it was constitutional or non-constitutional.
The draft lawsuit, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the legislative decree be declared unconstitutional as regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Commission Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the provisions of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives submitted constitutional complaints against the legislative decree.After accepting the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero ceased to apply the legislative decree and ceased all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the appeal submitted by the Chamber of Deputies, without participating in the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister expressed his disagreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by means of general rules.
She also recalled that for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, because it manages state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the benefits of digitalization, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it includes economic, social, political and security technical aspects."
These matters, she emphasized, "requireed the action of the whole system, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they included a set of features that the constitution puts in the hands of the central state government."
She recalled that many countries around the world have already carried out the digital transformation, through the government, despite having highly specialized institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the government would interfere with the competence of Congress by issuing the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected," she said.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán separately is considered
According to PREP data, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the ballots separately is a reality at this year’s Michoacán elections, as according to the data released by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governor’s elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still not counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9 the Electoral Office adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the federal reforms in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election round.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and deemed the vote of the State Commissioner on the constitutional reforms “invalid and unlawful” as he has no right to “decide or veto it.”
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of counting the votes individually that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local election authority can count the ballots partially or completely.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes do not coincide; the record on the counting and counting of votes is not in the record or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the records.
In addition, the total counting of the full-filled ballots may take place if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the second-place who is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request from the party-or coalition chairman who is the second of the aforementioned candidates.
The counting of votes may also be carried out in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral records have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapaliname mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés crashed this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace.
According to family members, the lieutenant’s last will was that his ashes would be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others killed in the crash, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican aircraft, where the people closest to the colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o’clock at noon, the ashes of the Lieutenant colonel landed in the Prayer Hall on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family members and friends came.
At 17:30, his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This body show was initiated by his former colleagues from the technical high school and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio was a member of during his preparation for high school.
“He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains,” said the pilot’s sister, Sandra Bacio Cortés.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he stood in the fullness of his life. "he was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not imagine it because they thought it would even be dizzying for him on a truck, but he always strived to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio, remembered him as a good man: "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he drove to Zapopán for the graduation of his family member.
The Last Farewell
Lt. of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honored under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. their honor was bestowed on him by the people and government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, the head of school and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology Education, where he studied in 1985 and was recognized as outstanding in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when his helicopter crashed, including Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority.
At 18.05 a.m., the incarcerated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the burial company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the outskirts of the barracks, where he was already awaited by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and sisters and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military officials presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different body parts and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The incident took place at kilometre 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall was looming.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him lay another who was dressed with a white top.
Nearly a meter away, the body of another person was in a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to information obtained on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another place because no cartridges were found.
On the wall of the country house, inscriptions can be read that one organized criminal gang writes to another, in addition, several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal process that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are linked to kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to publicly disclosed information, eight people were initially arrested on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were seized.The detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military officials found a car with two passengers in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
When inspecting the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to flee in the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret funerals in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the government formation.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed by a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of talks with political parties on government formation.
"I would like to reiterate my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of a government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well fixed,” he added.
Monti managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal.In the meantime, Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European politicians in order to regain the lost confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush on Monti was further intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were charged with 7 percent interest for 10 years.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government with all our strength.”
We believe this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Montis’ chances of success have been greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are aimed at delivering good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have voiced opposition to a government made up mostly of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure by pointing out that a Montis failure is a catastrophe.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
The round of session will be closed on Tuesday.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief rush towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of Italian government bonds has reached critical limits again.
Saving Italy with a state debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout scheme.
Monti said his administration would have to last until the next election, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms rather than prefer elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should only consist of technicians, a reminder of their concerns over the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more gambling opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players recalled from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the pot.
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 recalled 50 matches behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica is when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly match, which will take place today at 15.05 at San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champion, number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A matches, the three-colour team only has defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
This number he achieved last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-level European cups such as the Champions League each year.
Added to this is the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated qualifying games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
Tico players, on the other hand, have few international matches in the framework of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) reached an equal with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 overseas games.
Casillas will play today against the three-color team and Spain a new record of 127 overseas matches.
Xavi Hernández, a footballer from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke’s midfielder Raúl González with 102.
The number one hundred also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side attacker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the attacker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, there were only five in over 30 games: Keilor Navas at 31, Randall Azofeifa at 32, Michael Barrantes at 31, Carlos Hernández at 36 and José Luis López at 35.
Those with the least games.
Less than 30 games have been played in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller at 26, Winston Parks at 26, Gabriel Badilla at 25 and Roy Myrie at 23.
The rest are not even approaching the 20s boundary.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Víctor Bolívar recorded in Costa Rica only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not made their debut yet.
Spain’s historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twenty-year anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is preparing to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twenty-year anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium at 7:30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online issue of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream becomes a reality when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what it means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that will come true for us too.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once for a vacation.It’s such a beautiful country that we’ll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally dedicated.They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica.Thank you for waiting so long and we’re sorry for taking so long to come here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle, and Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always driven to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, we don’t set any limits.
We will try to give the best show possible with many different songs.We want to play a few songs from each album and provide our fans with a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why Why ?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs.Everyone likes a different song, so it’s not easy to decide which one to play.
If we record two or three songs that we have not played for a long time, we can keep our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked those songs.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes the total.
First of all, I think no one of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years.
We continue to put on this blessing and it’s great to be able to make music together even now.
We love each other and are enthusiastic about creating music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not be better.
What did it mean for you to participate actively in the birth of Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising and quite unusual when a move comes from a group of friends.
From time to time, a band comes out of a city, but it’s uncommon for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We’re thrilled to still be friends with them all and it’s an honour to be part of this rising Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to stay together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) hit us 13 years ago.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we care for each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy; on the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find balance?
The way we grew up has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t go on tour too often because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the sake of music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created without thinking about being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
For three years, we were a band that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed that it took so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band best. That’s why we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change the Yellow Ledbetter text when you play live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don’t know.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks of.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
of so many+
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the Grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I don’t think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time.If they are still important today, I find it great because it’s worth listening to that music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why Why ?
That’s interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit lightweight, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
I got tears to both of them when I heard Ed playing them.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happens in your life – like losing a family member or a friend – it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
The Peru:
Fujimori returns to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be examined for muscle loss in his legs, his family doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who served 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, who has been operated four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas Hospital to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons.
He was operated on tongue cancer four times and lost 18 kilograms of weight. Additional diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in custody at the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was acting secretly during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón on Wednesday, which will be the culmination of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the office of the South American country announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón’s support in the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community.This statement was rejected by Uruguay and triggered a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialized countries. Since January this year, an agreement has been in place on the exchange of tax information to avoid double predisposition with the South American country.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has sought to accelerate the specification of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to an increased trade in goods between the two countries.
Super Mario 3D Land enters the third dimension
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to rescue Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the shops around the world this month, has been tailored from the very beginning to the features of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which allows you to play three-dimensional without a special glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses,” said Omar Álvarez, the head of the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game to be developed for this console from the outset" because so far hit articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows for a fast, fluid gameplay.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less shitty users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of play, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" in real time or one that only affects the depth of the action.
This trip of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the character’s return to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo cries to the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success in recent editions: The crawling installor must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies – and a “playable” Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo’s extradition to the United States
Guatemala President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would accept the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to be held accountable in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
The trial ends with the U.S. request for Portillo’s extradition so that he can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, considering that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his reign he did not interfere in court decisions and granted all extradition requests he was notified of.
With the exception of Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms Act is a government act that takes place after all the judicial and constitutional instances for convicting the former state president (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for undermining 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial preceded his extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of Trinijove’s life have brought important results: in this quarter-century, 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped to find a way out of their difficult situation.
More than a hundred jobs have been created for this group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a record was drawn yesterday at an event in the former Fabra i Coats factory buildings, which attended more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous leaders of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions in election campaign times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the celebrations the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and at the time left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was founded in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation."
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything suggests that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday at noon to leave the building they held illegally occupied and where they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the clearance, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the home administrator confirmed.
The occupants, who occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply with them.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, lasting up to two days, pushing tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the house occupants were making their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while those in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the recreational room had been indicated by the neighbors for disruption of retirement, while, according to her statement, the noise did not come from the visitors to the disco, but from the occupants of the house and in particular from the guests of the parties organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors, have become more and more in recent weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the past nine months.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that it has received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for the building to be cleaned immediately and the problems of civil coexistence and the downturn of the district to be addressed.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the house occupants had penetrated all floors of the building and almost all apartments.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and take action against the antisocial acts in the building.”
Yesterday, another building in the district of Nou Barris was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 15:30, police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to break into the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees, agree with the tender.
The city bidding for the 16 gates reopens the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its blasphemy about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in the city of Barcelona.
It was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper border of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the yogis.
This was the point when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for additional access doors to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either it is so, or someone is planning to set goals on the ground.
The question arises: Collserola, park or mountain?
Not only from an organisational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the tender is the subject of conversation in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring topic that two members of this old-fashioned caste who meet in the elevator can resort to.
And this fact provides the fabric for one of the rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona think about and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is "necessary" to speak over the "front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as Ildefons Cerda's discourse on the green apples has not been delivered.
“One should assume that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" holds a "lexical trap" in itself: one should not imagine it "as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas where action must be carried out."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers arising from "the uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is your own limitation to what can be built.
“To limit something always means to set the next step,” that is, to go beyond it.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [relating to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, who holds closer to the issue, simplifies the view that the side of Collserola, which goes toward Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go toward Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study from the patronage of de Collserola that should not "take on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving its panel the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
Furthermore, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guidebook that allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his “doubts” as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams set up (“just the right thing,” he says) “We architects should only be a tool.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex because the tender terms lack a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-section competitions," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis.
This has at least in his case led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should necessarily guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped throughout its length to create a smooth transition between the city and green areas.
Casino grants Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red releases the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of captivity, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of Casino Red has delivered him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
Following the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money for the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
Following the indictment, the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case against the brother of the panistish mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministry of Public 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministry of Public denied the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the detention facility of Cadereyta for allegedly stealing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as a prisoner of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a warrant was sent to him by the Secretary of the District’s Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who found that, after the almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to declare Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, Casino Red’s representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, requested Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to release him in the coming hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Public assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had repaired the damage and which owner of the betting house had given his forgiveness.
According to the case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak.
After hearing the representative of the bookmaker at 15:50, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been released and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome reveals details of the plane crash that killed government secretary Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) that the results of the investigation into the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed indicate that the helicopter, with its entire intact structure, crashed directly into the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
“The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 meters high, with the helicopter losing the body, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts.”
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that during the investigations, no helicopter parts were found in the area where the plane landed.
"During the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but this can take several months, maybe even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Emergency Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial flew at travel speed and the aircraft fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the collision."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
The flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight.This means that the crew should have had sufficient vision during the flight and on the ground.
The weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start.During the continued flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, some deep clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with better views towards the Cuernavaca Valley due to the clouds.
Place of Collision:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter matched, possibly there was neither a loss of control over the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from both a straight and a side direction.
The pattern of dispersed aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter, with its unspoiled structure, had crashed to the ground.
No indications of fire or explosion.
The remains of the aircraft provide at the crash site do not allow to close to fire or explosion.
The latest findings indicate several ground contacts.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping down and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a thorough search in an area beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts were found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had crashed to the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence" to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI clinic, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
Interested people can come to the IMSS sports venues in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8 p.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Cuauhtémoc sporting field (in the west of the state of Mexico) and has continued since 8 October at the Nezahualcóyolt sporting field (in the east of the state of Mexico).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study is continued at the Independencia sports court (in the south of the capital district) and completed at the Morelos court (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On World Diabetes Day, he stated that the goal is that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He further noted that on the aforementioned Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors were determined (attempting to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of healthcare professionals’ concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
“Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 found that in just six years the proportion of obese boys has increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population differs from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican is 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, reflecting in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained, the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken from us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants would be a comprehensive examination of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the presence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and on the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of pre-stage metabolic disorders and diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors.The doctors explain all measurement results to the parents and suggest them lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there would be three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and using means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugary beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents bump holes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM, has developed asphalt modified with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations.
Being attentive to the signs coming from the road cover, it would not be necessary to repair 200,000 bump holes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and assuring that if the layout and maintenance of the asphalt coating is done properly, the number of bump holes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Block holes from a technical point of view" he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce an asphalt-like mixture, but that has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera argued that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road cover and thus avoid the appearance of bump holes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes.
The elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very tenuous and at 50°C it is almost firm, while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"That means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes in a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible street coating consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wearable layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good power distribution on the road.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," the chemical engineer said.
"Over the wear layer," he concluded, "is laid a last layer, the so-called carrier layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
Because these layers are in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
In addition to receiving and distributing the most forces from this road coating, the support layer also needs an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must beined.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water penetrates into the layer and it is only difficult to come out again.This causes the softening of all layers of the road cover and, as a result, the appearance of bump holes.
When a hole occurs,” he said, “the ceiling layer is first worn off and the wear layer is only damaged afterwards.But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to beined at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs.”
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause of shock holes.Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road coating must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is observed to avoid frequent shock holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the hole can be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives its 14th Missest.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty at the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez had to satisfy Serna with standing on the winning podium, showcasing a silver crown and the band she designates as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department has already received 14 mistakes and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crown in their hands. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected to the Queen of Police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles also received by the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury’s decision to nominate her for First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “Which book has most influenced you and why?” asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I think it is a way of civilizing myself, in the end, I believe that the book that most influenced my childhood is The Little Prince, a very profound book.
Currently I am reading 'Guilt and Atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called 'Passions'.
A response that encountered little reciprocity, firstly because of the term 'civilize yourself' and secondly because she had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens, what needs to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'.
Among other things, it is said that the beloved of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the favourite who hid all the applause and who had received all the awards in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre) "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who therefore could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed when she first performed in her swimsuit on the beach at the Hilton Hotel and in her two lifts at the coronation ceremony.
Although she appeared safely in both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the RCN channel’s “Como en casa” program, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss “shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not eventually become queen.”
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia.You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had worked on projects before joining the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which were noted in her stomach area.But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen’s coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there would be better, “but her problem with abdominal fibrosis, which was hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine believes that the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to get them done properly.
Her body has never been her stronger side, and this job she had to pay for.”
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after appearing in the swimsuit, a cruel prediction arose that should come true in the night. It was rumored that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort prize to prevent her from entering the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that from today on, Melina will run her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent on appointment of the National Beauty Competition of Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, missed the crown.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a lophoscopist from the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor’s Office (CTI) of Cali came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia): “Alfonso Cano” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had a standby service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and, after completing the required courses, specialized in laphoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the hands and feet.
In the week of deployment against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was instructed to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night he flew a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that one was suspected to be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world.
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because it was not at all similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
Fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a lamp, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the printing sheet.
He had seen right: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was actually the leader of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a Dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the recognition given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science with no error rate that can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery cases and confirm the identities of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identity documents or they have none.
We take your fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that in a theft he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house because the thief had stood up with his hand right there as he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be the suspect, and actually a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, he is still linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopist at the CTI explained that "fingerprints were taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a plant cell or tape is used to take.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Personal Status Office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without passports,” the CTI expert said.
He argued that not everything is as it would be depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if a corresponding comparison is made.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most followed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York on Tuesday as they again attempted to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared from the square at dawn and trying to occupy another seat on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters pressed together in front of the Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to gain access with a court order allowing the "insulted" to re-tent at this place.In the meantime, another part of the movement adhered to the evacuation order and occupied a park further north of the city, where nine arrests occurred.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray argued that the response of the "insulted" to the evacuation of their tent camp, ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible evacuation of the square and authorizing the demonstrators to tent.
In addition, the “indignants” occupied a new park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. But then the police entered and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give accurate numbers. He assured Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had gathered at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support to the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a property in private ownership) remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday to analyze the legality of the evacuation that took place at dawn.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them.They even gave them to some policemen who guarded the square, resulting in "some small clashes," as Bray, who indicated some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as applying “laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this court order the reopening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators was cancelled. he pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to settle again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, in which 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators “violated the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the site to be cleared because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others" because "some had received threats" and the locals feared "for their quality of life".
“The evacuation at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not the interests of North American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “failing to respect press freedom.”
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were considering organizing “large actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months since the protests on September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1 in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas".
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas", breathing life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed pictures of the television show today in which Anderson – who also appears for the distribution on the Internet of a self-filmed porn in which she appears alongside her former husband, the drummer of “Mötley Crüe,” Tommy Lee – acts as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her womb supposedly depicting Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a host on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" show, appears as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in late March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, Bublé described North American Kim Kardashian as "a prostitute" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan resurrected after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends free fall spiral from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had ever experienced was World War II.
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo estimated the material damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of falls, the GDP data from July to September served to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quota high for the year.
Measured in the second quarter – in Japan, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 – it also represents the fastest growth since the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% drop for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first drop after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual shift in Japan’s economy is not based solely on keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is awakening especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increasing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refuge currencies” for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the dim forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that loads like a grave on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the yen listing.
While the markets continue to siege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of the yen,” said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which precedes the turning points of the world economy, showed that the brakes would have been pulled with the biggest economic potential.
Because it fell by four-tenths to loosely 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which is 100 points, after falling eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens has raised doubts
Papadimos says austerity measures would be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the rising risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also continuing to get lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the new Greek transitional government’s “consensus” is more a response to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being demonstrated by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and in no way withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions made at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate in the vote of confidence for the new government tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara’s statement does not remove doubts about his stance: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else.”
The Conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effects of the poker game with the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "do not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek rocks are still in dirt for a while.
Queen Sofia: “These are instruments of progress and hope”
The Queen stressed Spain’s “dominant” position with regard to this type of financing
Spain “has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance.”
Queen Sofia of Spain reminded yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed into the world's second donor for this means of international cooperation.Their "essence" is based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on trust in the people".
The Queen was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people who have to live with income of less than a dollar a day, that is, below the "poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will start from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will guarantee "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved a lot of successes" and "we face a lot of challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for pushing forward “two fundamental goals.”
The Queen stated that it aims to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 10 million of these households will be above the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world dates back to the path “initiated years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia judges as an “act of justice and recognition.”
She described the father of this funding instrument as a “admirable idealist dedicated to fighting poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and further meetings in Côte d’Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006.At all, “we can observe a continuous development,” the queen explained, whose commitment to this project yesterday gave her the rating as the “head of the family” in Valladolid and as the “interrogator of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging the attendees to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical Commandment”
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez noted that solidarity is "an ethical mandate" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it is a mistake to bind development aid in times of economic boom, because it is a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that microcredit is a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty,” and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now “more than ever” work on solidarity criteria, and not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the “success” of giving “hope” to “marginalized” people who “always stand behind closed doors” and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present in a city that “opens its doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity”.
The CDU proposes to elect the president of the EU by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig went without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially envisaged in the programme, but it came into effect in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government’s policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow too lax.
The proposal for the Presidency of the European Commission proposed by the Bureau was approved almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The several minutes-long standing ovation, which, due to their intervention results, first held Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, lived no open doubts on the part of the three European-approved finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor – as well as the quote – has the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is “not less, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could be reflected in an amendment to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union with regard to the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries; but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote “to give Europe a face”.
This, however, is one of the proposals adopted by Congress, to which Wolfgang Schäuble Pate clearly stood.
Certainly it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh each country in the ECB’s Board of Directors according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously brought about a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, thinking of calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl; however, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or troubled European countries, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European proposal devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in illness reporting?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now taking the sick reporting steps.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15 to visit a family aid box and deliver a speech on the topic of fighting social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been repeated since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which begins with an attempt to put the economy under a tough test, but on the other hand represents no less forecasts of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on worker illness reports.
First, with a budgetary objective: the government aims to introduce a fourth day of absence before taking into account an illness report among workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose four-day salary without the specific company’s permission, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to arouse anger, however, would help to raise 280 million euros.
And that would be accompanied by another measure of a more symbolic character: granting the state officials an unpaid duty day in case of illness (so far there is no duty period for them, unlike the three duty days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority are also again unleashing the fraud theme, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence from work.
“Controls will be much more important, and moreover, they will be reimbursed if requested,” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, in front of the microphone of RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of sickness reports appears to be somewhat disproportionate.
Indeed, it has been the subject of constant observation since 2002, as well as of political offensives, which have most often yielded fruit.
French people are not more likely to get sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
But let’s start with the national figures.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid for daily repayments in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Healthcare, the daily expenses in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, representing 5% of healthcare expenditures.
Below this amount were 46% for maternity leave and work accidents and 54% for sick leave, which amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One average that masks some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed not having taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time recorded by the Health Insurance, makes it clear that 37% of illness reports in 2010 were of less than 8 days duration; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbors, French workers are therefore not more likely to be incapable of work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence rate (due to illness or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick report fraud represents a disappearing small percentage in terms of black work.
There is only a weak scale of fraud here.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on illness reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College for Training and Continuing Training of Technicians and Engineers) under 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the 285,000 realized short-term illness reports, that is, in 37.050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of illness reporting lasting more than 45 days, under 1.2 million 11% of cases were "unsuitable or unjustified", which is 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 “unjustified” cases for several million workers who claimed a sickness report.
A figure that represents only a weak margin compared, for example, to that of black labour.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a fact report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of loss of tax gain per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily pay, and thus much more than the depreciation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to capture its economy.
This was announced on Monday, November 14, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, adding to the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to do this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners, as well as a new program for budgetary adjustment," he said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the participation of the country within the euro zone would be "on the table," he added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country’s deficit “by 9%” of today’s GDP by the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Opposition rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, agreed on Monday to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be willing to take additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary assembly of his party New Democracy.
He had pledged to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from Außen.
Euthanasia and accompanying death must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors were working together on pain relief treatments to provide the best pain relievers, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a rejection of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they want to die and make dispositions for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada involving six experts interconnected in various disciplines, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This panel recommends that the government amend the criminal code in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice occurs, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a start, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent society EIU that compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada is ranked 10th in this regard, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to cut the subject of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of these end up dying in the hospital.
Considered across the country, Quebec has the highest rate of hospitalized deaths, with 86%.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not intend to make any amendments to the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
Now, according to the experts, who have equally inspected all those countries whose approaches have legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, the co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Companion suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians oppose euthanasia
Remember, according to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it allowed people at the end of their lifetime to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
Regarding those who have already committed accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As forining or discontinuing funds in patients, the situation appears to be less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the Criminal Code should specify that the disposal of funds for which a valid refusal has been submitted should not be considered criminal.
The panel also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a life-end disposal without fear of prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors were working together on pain relief treatments to provide the best pain relievers, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the pain relief or life-threatening measures already widely used in Canadian healthcare institutions, the panel calls for at least consideration of these measures, as they did not serve as much as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and they refer to the same procedures.
Reservations of Other Experts
Some experts in the field of healthcare law have already made reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the experts signing the report as “extreme” because it sets no limits to the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final phase.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place individual self-responsibility above all other values involved in the social impact of society.
Now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she titled "Pro-Euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts the reports regarding the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus condemns “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad, who, however, is facing him thanks to Russia’s support and demonstrates a “conspiracy” against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League’s exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, having taken a position in favour of an abdication of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the one in office Arab prime minister who urged President Bashar al-Assad to "determine his power in Syria", in which about forty civilians and members of the government power have already been killed.
"If Bashar puts the interests of his country at the heart, he would step down, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have been unsuccessful.
“Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave,” he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey has an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, in turn, welcomed the “strengthening of consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an increasingly sharp tone in the face of the repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have been killed in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Two other civilians were killed, according to the NGO, in "shootings and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
During a news conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim said the country was "turning towards the end of the crisis."
He also stressed the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considered a “dangerous step.”
Syria "will not surrender," he said, adding that "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a “protective mechanism for civilians” and wants the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé has also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which is encapsulated in his "paranoia".
A scheduled new League meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to tackle the crisis agreed on November 2, but in particular the controversial and likely withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities as well as the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the Arab League’s decision yesterday as “incorrect” to avoid advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, despite China already urging Syria to implement the crisis withdrawal plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian prime minister, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands “victims” to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of Berlusconi’s government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in parliament consisting relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the current council president.
Gianfranco Fini, chairman of the House of Representatives, had, on his part, waited for Mario Monti to submit a vote of confidence to parliament by Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Monti of a removal list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness in the stock and bond markets took its time.
In “a democracy there are certain deadlines” to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, noting that it is “certain that the markets will be patient and prudent.”
His order by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had since intensified again, after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The current prime minister was to set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he emphasized that he would like to involve "politicians" as well.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the chairman of the House of Representatives, the new government should receive the confidence certificate from parliament by Friday.
Since taking office, Monti has committed himself to working urgently towards the goal of making Italy a “new protagonist” in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even with the new government in mind."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not its budget balancing goal in 2013, despite the austerity plans put forward in recent months, has in particular called for new tightening measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, the head of the leaders of Italy, who will meet on Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to boost the economy “because a country that has no growth to show cannot respect deficit indicators.”
Monti, known for his competence as well as his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an “era change” of Italy after 17 years of “Berlusconism”; the “professor” symbolizes the “challenge of trustworthiness” as well as a “other Italy”, according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to raise 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator capable of using a nuclear weapon, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) based the findings on the recent IAEA report and other documents from that UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its “serious concern” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked in a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the early 1960s and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was said to have left the center to set up a company in Kiev that manufactures "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA cited “strong evidence that Iran’s development of a nuclear explosive system has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only highly skilled in this technique, but also, as one member stated to the agency, has worked on this technology directly on his country’s military nuclear energy program throughout his professional career.”
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religious-motivated violent crimes have either decreased slightly or only increased slightly over the same period, according to the FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crime against Jews, and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes have been recorded.
The total number of “hate-motivated crimes” has risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% of racial and 20% of religious-motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
“After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” Human Rights First said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law,” said Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he said, adding that this could be done by improving the police’s attitude toward “hatred crimes.”
The "crime of hatred" is represented in U.S. federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King’s death to punish acts of violence against race, colour, religion or descent, and now also involves sexual crimes.
Twitter is changing the platform and increasingly resembling Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users in particular to monitor the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" will allow you to better understand the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you are following and who are following your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, whether you subscribe to new posts, prefer certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested on "a small percentage of users" before its widespread Internet spread on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with some esoteric wording (RT for referenced repetition of another person's post). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain"Tweets" over the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive, and too much like Facebook,” wrote @jemb123.
“The ‘activity’ feature will help me better track certain elements of my stream Twitter,” said @dannykronstrom.
Austrian
Entry of a “Golden Budget Rule” into the Constitution
Austria’s ruling government, a large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition, decided on Tuesday to incorporate a “golden budget rule” into the constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria’s top bonity (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who personally announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria is at 74.6%, that is, far above the criterion of 60%, set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency would not have dropped from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, deputy chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister.
Austria also fulfils a demand from the Brussels summit of the eurozone member states on 26 October: The heads of state and government then demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or by passing an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government in this regard is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The goal is to eradicate budgetary debt by 2020/21 below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continues to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene as we did last time," Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen fell to close to the historic levels forced by the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold the yen for the dollar to lower the Japanese currency’s value, which is about to push a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has stepped up regularly, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global recession and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was listed around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This stroke of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it prices the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income drawn from abroad by Japanese firms, as they exchange them into national currency.
“Japan is struggling for its reconstruction after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east),” emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that this valuation of the yen could kill the weak recovery already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter -1,5% compared to the previous quarter, the third world economic power has gained traction for the first time this year thanks to the jumping exports and consumption of the households “plummeted” by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the valuation of the yen does not "reflect the economic foundations of Japan."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to de-power the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has informed that the BoJ has already initiated “appropriate measures,” indicating that no additional currency loosening is expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to eliminate the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The Eurozone:
Interest rates rise rapidly, stocks make retreats
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little more into negative fields this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4 percent, while London fell by 0.1 percent.
“Due to new tensions over the yields of government bonds in the troubled eurozone, global stock markets are continuing to release part of their recent gains.
“Capital investors are nervous and too aware of the risk of infection,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which, in turn, suffers from the reiterated fears of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed down by 0.7%.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency, which continues to rise on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level in a year and a half.
At 10 p.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, so it fell by 0.4%.
According to stock brokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, approved a proposal that provides in particular for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and that of Spanish bonds reached 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by debt paralysis.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions made on the occasion of the October 27 summit of the Eurozone is "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sight of the markets as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth figures in the Eurozone
Statistically speaking, France recorded a 0.4% domestic consumption-driven economic growth in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Bureau of Statistics INSEE revised the fall in the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economists most.
Germany saw a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first high rate for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a recession again.
The Energy Policy:
Facts win over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to hold an election meeting to reflect on this topic and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruitful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, the shortage of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to tackle climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to the need to find a substitutable source, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
However, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, in turn, has decided to add another unit to its park after Fukushima by re-entrying the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model focused on renewable energy is occasionally set as a model, however, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The elections in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, increased by the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader in wind energy, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French households.
As the energy price plays a key role in the globalized economy, as well as the stability of the industry nationwide, the French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp rise in energy prices, making noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as they demonstrate resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual €6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to operate for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no miracle tool for generating electricity, just as there is no devil’s work.
The low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear and renewable energy developed by the company Areva testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks at existing plants such as the Flamanville building.
Those working teams that have made themselves a name because of their professionalism are just obsessed with the idea of security.
In the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major disruptions.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sparked by reactor construction and endless human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, causing the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and engineers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft that enables it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electricians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, letting them free track to take on leadership in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manipulations dominate a debate that equally determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a number-driven policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by officials had shaped the weekly shows, and the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of May 23) that France “needs no talents, maurs or waiters from abroad.”
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right hand, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left, by Michel Rocard, who stated in 1990 that France "cannot embrace all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is in the degree of grossness.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish clampers was shared in 2005 by both the right and the left.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of grossness that one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande limits himself in his program to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This concept of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can potentially affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352, p.
Restricting immigration would deter growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they are threatening to replace the domestic workforce, especially the less skilled, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they focus on occupations in sectors that are technically unemployed.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not stimulate local wage workers, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where education is not matched with job offerings.
Positive wage effects
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that an 1% increase in the flow of immigrants would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants is beneficial to the creation of ideas as well as economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, on average about 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 contributes an average net contribution (income minus expenses) of around €150,000 to the public budget during his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted at the beginning of his term of office to bring the missing cuts "with the teeth".
However, these said teeth, which were meant to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to rethink European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had lost the entire 20th century over the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some may have believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy once and for all overcome its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the attitude of the mind.
The universal right to vote, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can as well become a “instrument of oppression” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed it at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, economic and social spirit of community, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe in which we are now is an economic crisis, but it is also, and above all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mindset of the Greek truth-false referendum would have had a double insightful character in this regard: on the one hand, the need for a powerful return of politics, and on the other hand, the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inapplicability.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by pressing for the success of the national referendum, which was organized according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A free-being for the European monarch or a jump with closed eyes into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a grand choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, rightfully, clearly and consistently, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you don't know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that succumbs to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its inability and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated internationally.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe – it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and therefore each of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give back to the sovereignty of the people the leadership of the European project.
Because it’s all about whether Europeans can reduce their debt burden, free themselves from the markets, and embark on a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis requires decisions at the European level, which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy, without leading us to destruction.
After this proposal has long been opposed by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing European economic leadership to do so.
Agree with .
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy – as it presupposes to the citizens – would be another folly and another impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order for the republic to arise in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not be enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people’s sovereignty.
We need Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are becoming commonplace
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards and phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most prominent segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments in public transportation or settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million units sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and will account for more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground on contactless payments after long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Mastercards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically issuing contactless-chiped bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
However, this is only the first step on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappointingly small percentage of devices are currently equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to perform these transactions.
“You are in delay.”
“But they should experience a real upward development at least next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test race in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also Société Générale said yesterday that it will prepare the launch of an offer that will allow its customers contactless payment via mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
The long-suspected ties between the Islamic Maghreb terrorist group al-Qaeda (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria now “has gained certainty” about this.
"The manner in which the two organizations act, as well as the relations of the intelligence services, indicate a clear cooperation," he said without going into further details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French citizens in Niger in January last year has sparked tensions.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, were said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their abductors in an operation conducted by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators said they found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
terrorist axis
The analysis of guided phone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger, and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), the investigators are interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is thought to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for clearer evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
“It is conceivable.”
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from Auven and that this one is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo says.
In recent months, these “support services” have become increasingly evident in their course, as have Boko Harem’s speeches and operational modes, which now indicate the attraction of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives with the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has since exercised pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Indeed, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of Illuminati that needs no special attention.
Faster success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf – which in Haoussa means “Western education is a shame” – Boko Haram is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this middleless region, the unification is experiencing rapid success.
It politizes itself and claims strict observance of the Sharia law, while its affiliated activists engage in the struggle against the evil central government.
The activists are first targeting churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were active with their intensified attacks on the police offices.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usual indifferent.
The army is surrounding the city, 800 people are killed.
The captive Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its high castles in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing that occurred at the secure police headquarters in Abuja – the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since worried all security experts.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somali al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, even Alain Juppé, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, warned of Boko Harem and showed himself ready "to communicate all indications".
The World by Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and helping Israel.
Can a crisis-affected America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate in this way, voters could get almost that impression.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their colleagues have repeatedly made their dumb statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Slogans fall over China, Iran, and Israel’s aid – often not understood in any way.
Mitt Romney, the highest-ranking in terms of the appointment of the “Grand Old Party”, threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of “currency manipulation” – a leading issue in an America that is irritated to the utmost by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
It was foolish if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who appears to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost shunned the air about his gesture of licking emotions.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also the current stance of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being heard as he stagnates in the depths of polls.
Similarity of Reagan
Romney had also pledged military strikes against Iran if the sanctions aimed at stopping the nuclear program fail.
“If I am elected, I will order Iran to stop,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb.”
He also promised increased military aid to Israel and accused Obama of remaining guilty of commitments to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, is displaying a shameful ignorance of files.
He recently called for counteracting China’s military threat as Beijing “tries to develop a nuclear power” – and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes on Iran, is overwhelmingly willing to take the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the 2008 Republican candidate, a heavyweight outside politics.
Unlike the current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to put water in his wine when it came to the anti-terrorist issue.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive talks with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his “boys” from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not so relentless.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive national security balance sheet under Obama, which bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself from military interventions that lead to slowdown.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to revive its leadership.
Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It will supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glory and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at a buffet.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the steering wheel of the valve that carries Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will be delivered annually through a first pipeline of 1.224 km that connects the region of St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which will allow a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the total French consumption - is expected to be completed at the end of 2012.
The possibility of building a third line on the same route has already been announced.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this enormous construction is a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable a direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any crossroads by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on land routes.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a bit of their power: it is now becoming harder for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to block access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord Stream pipeline to a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically very sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of a depreciation of European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have high gas consumption and their gas reserves are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing to the extent to which the large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas transmission pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with concrete coating, which is designed to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, in approximately 200 m depth.
During its construction, mining fields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed for caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Furthermore, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The cable is a long metal string, weighing as much as 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from it because the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state company settle permanently at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the gas door in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission can thus escape into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the welding seams were estimated to have a durability of one leak per 100,000 years.
State surveillance of gas transmission is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a sea ship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas transmission pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures a meter in diameter, is inserted into the inside of the pipeline and moves through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device at its arrival provides the most accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas transmission pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance point and 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E.ON and BASF are affiliated here (15,5% respectively), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company group GDF Suez (9% respectively).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
Its headquarters is in Switzerland, where taxation is inexpensive.
Gazprom has subsequently leased the entire capacity of its gas transportation to this company, under a 20-year renewable contract.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how large the real amount of gas that is transported falls out,” Jens Müller said.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labor costs are expected to be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are sure to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline comes to light on a sandy, wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas exit gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, at candlestick hours spent with writing.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular bandage, its rubber ribbon, its egg-shell-colored sides, as aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, headquartered in Milan, decided at the time to bring a distinguished design notebook to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant for the company, is in charge of launching the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a wool coating that is used, for example, for coating pads.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first few years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a fantasy picture of the buyers, as the notebook enthusiastically enthusiasticates business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebook books in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers and is keen to assert its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and its new writing need, which persists despite the rise of emails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called “Detour” in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebook books.
In August, the company also launched a bandage with leopard patterns at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of time and learned how to diversify its products: bags, schedule calendars, fillers, computer envelopes... The brand has the entire range of items.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, opening a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week of Work for Disabled People begins today.
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% unemployment rate of the total population.
and disappointing?
“No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which hosts the ‘Work Week for Disabled Persons’.
“The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable.”
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher.
“H, there is still a lot to do.”
However, it must be said that there are still numerous obstacles for disabled unemployed people to get a job.
It affects older people more often: 37% are older than 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no bachelor’s degree and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among people with disabilities versus 38% overall.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work, and that are "the core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes of mind, which, though certain, yet slowly evolve.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Entrepreneurs Association for La Cité magazine stated that the managers surveyed had “a weak level of knowledge about disabled people” that was “overrepresented” by “persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees have a long way to go before reaching the target of 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a 1987 law.
These last figures, dated from 2008, refer to a rate of 2.6%.
"We are now around the 3%," said Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that disobeyed this law.
The evidence: The number of "tax-paying" establishments and the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which provides for tax increases, has put a lot of pressure on companies,” said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large corporate groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the facilities employ disabled workers between 20 and 49, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: “What a fortune”
Even before they gave the face to the Blue Tuesday evening (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasure that the friendship game brought them.
It would be too far to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience podium at Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
“I want to look forward,” insists the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his representation in Club and Nationalelf, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine."
However, without missing the note of “pleasure.”
He has been at the French national team since the age of seven, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further reinforcing the “unique” character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presented.
“We just crossed the road.”
"To be able to play against them means great luck."
Leekens, on the other hand, sounded “pride” with kindness.
“The pride of being a gallamatch.”
“Pride” also to confirm – in his capacity as a “neighbor” – that France “has again become a team at a very high level,” and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a fucking good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blue (the French Nationalelf) ... to Brazil in 2014.
“We little Belgians get out roughly,” he emphasized.
“We’re planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games," the match against France included.
Portugal is confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the return against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
At the end of the game, both teams were lacking.
At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.
Paulo Bento has already seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is one match to play and one to serve off, namely Bosnia.
Given the finish (0-0) on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the cubes have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the so important stamp on the matter that would have taken the pressure from it.
“This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we didn’t score a goal out.”
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that is likely to be equally hot on the game, even if the match was of course announced as "very short," said the optimistic, but clear-minded Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced that we can win the overhand,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship,” said Carlos Queiroz.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw may already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"It's a good result, but it carries some risk because we didn't score a goal," Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, in order to “do not give them time to reflect.”
This is a good idea, provided that it is implemented.
