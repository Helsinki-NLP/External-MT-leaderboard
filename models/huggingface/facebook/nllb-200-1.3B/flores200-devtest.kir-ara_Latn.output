Project-based learning makes it easier and more fun, and scaffolding can do more than that.

The scaffolding learning method can be both virtual and real. For example, the teacher is a real life teacher, and also the little person in the Microsoft Office form can play the role of the teacher.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the program, and they're designed to help the student explain, ask questions, and talk about processes that they can't solve alone.

Transport flow is the study of the movement and interaction of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.

Fortunately, drivers are pretty stable, so the streams on the roads are reasonably fluid, and they can be mathematically represented.
To get a more accurate picture of traffic flow, we made a link between three key parameters: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roadway facilities.
