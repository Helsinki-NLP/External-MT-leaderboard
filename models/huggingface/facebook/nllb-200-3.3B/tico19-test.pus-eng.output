Total number of cases of rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The overall number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom shows similar occurrences, confirming that, while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading faster in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and care units should increase their preparedness to handle the increase in COVID-19 patients who will require health care and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 20 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the reporting agent as a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have less illness, e.g. respiratory illness from pneumonia with or without pneumonia, and most are healthy.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a very serious illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases develop a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assess the overall incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom and compare this to the Chinese province of Hubei.
We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK in Italy during the period 31 January 2020-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and EU/EEA countries
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically and the COVID-19 pandemic dynamically follows the rest of the world currently.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a global pandemic.
In Eurovigilance 2020, on 5 March Spiteri et al reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Europe, as defined by the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported on 24 January 2020 in travellers returning from France to Hubei, China, and Wuhan.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, while 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported between December 2019 and this date, with 1,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone.
Total number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative incidence
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each country worldwide is calculated from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the country, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) at 8:00 a.m. daily.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 incidences in the EU/EEA and the UK, and it was compared with Italy.
As a sign of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day decreased cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 during the period 1 January-15 March 2020 in every EU/EEA country and the UK.
We present the total number of confirmed cases per country at 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases from the UK and EU/EEA countries
This process followed the 14 day multiple occurrence of COVID-19 cases in the EV/EEA countries and the UK, followed by Hubei Province (China) in general (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (overall items).
This was largely due to a rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK also showed similar increases in overall COVID-19 incidence (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EV/EEA countries and the United Kingdom for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020 compared to that in Italy.
It points out that, as of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported similar cases to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The intensity observed in overall COVID-19 cases suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a remarkable rate in all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, differences in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries, have different protocols for the selection of patients and follow-up testing that should be performed to confirm COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Admission data documents for COVID-19 cases in hospital and/or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to supplement current surveillance records focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, with 29.2 beds per 100,000 population available in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12 - 12.5 nursing and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity centralisation, with each EU/EEA country estimated and UK hospitals at >90% risk of COVID-19 cases exceeding the concentrated care bed capacity, are presented in the 6th ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
As cases have so far been clustered in some regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and care unit units usually determine the local catchment population, information on cases and care beds should preferably be provided in the name of the area unit.
Our experience from Italy shows that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and care units should thus prepare themselves for the continuing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increased number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, and particularly intensive care, as is the case in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, rather than a containment approach, as the projected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to plan, adopt and implement their response if not implemented early.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the disease to reduce the impact of the global pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as countries are likely to increase their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on healthcare.
Failure to do so, may result in health systems in other EU/EEA countries facing an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world.
Similar to its homologue, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by evening-afternoon mosquitoes and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissible and affects older individuals than younger and men more than women.
In response to the rapid number of publications on chronic disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing topic of research.
We will cover the basics of disease prevention, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help in understanding and eliminating the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been asked to stay indoors for all holidays and most weeks due to the outbreak of the new infection.
The coronavirus (CoV) is highly homologous to the one that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the related disease was named CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The disease began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to about 50 other countries worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had produced more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients had been discharged and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "top enemy of the people" and is exponentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.Since the first report on 7 January 2020 that the virus had been isolated from most patients, the virus has been isolated from most patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in this new and rapidly growing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another CoV-derived disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, released in 2012).
We will also discuss the prevention and diagnosis of the disease and some of the urgent questions we have learned so far.
CoVs have traditionally been known to cause non-fatal illnesses to humans, typically causing 15% of common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which in fact caused the outbreak first in China in 2003 and then in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread the disease and death to many other countries with fear.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third largest CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was published.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
At the same time, the disease spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, a health care provider infection was reported, suggesting human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was shut down with all public transportation shut down.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the outbreak of the disease from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared it a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread in China and had also infected about 50 other countries worldwide. (Fig. 2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the ultimate scope and severity of the outbreak will be further determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a new updated description of the disease as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 of the infected patients were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected 0.27 per 100,000 males (0.31 per 100,000 females) more than it has infected females.
COVID-19 was mainly spread in and around Hubei in clusters.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The mean duration of the contamination was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary reproductive index (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of cases increased dramatically before 23 January 2020, compared to the peak transmission time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.86), and the mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (59-40.2%: 95% CI).
The three risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses that contain a single sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four types, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The Speck-Packet (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the diptoidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of these cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and subsequent membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is reacted, the genomic RNA forms a variety of vesicles with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then stagnate with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of the beta-CoV with a greater than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the main area of outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MAR-CoV.
Through transmission balectron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin portions of the human aortic epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds much less strongly to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form short proteins that are secreted by orf3b and orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and selectivity of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known active domain or form.
On February 18, 2020, Xu, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of a full-length human ACE2 at a 2.9 Å contraction in the complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed states, assembled as dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind the two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and intermediate host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from evening primates and were transmitted to humans via cats and camels, respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the bat was the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs known as -SL-CoVZX45.
However, what intermediate hosts have helped the virus to overcome the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission is still unclear.
J. A. Al-Maran proposed a virus from the mouse as a carrier for humans that contained a homologous group within the S protein.
Based on a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that pangolins - long-lived, sweet-tasting arthropods often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the likely intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99% genetic homology in CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the prevalence of 1% difference in the two genomes is still a large difference; thus, the true and accurate evidence is in the eye of the beholder (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the wet environment for up to 48 hours in vitro and can survive for up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; or 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing, disinfectant, parasitic acid, chloroform and other solvents, but chlorhexidine cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
All human populations are generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to this unknown virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4)).
Typically, after the virus attacks the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the C-type lectin-like receptor, the all-type receptor (TLR) NOD-like receptor (NLR), and the - (RLR).
In a variety of ways, viruses stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell completion, and interferon-type I (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is incorporated into the fight against the virus.
T4 lymphocytes play an important role in the defense of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro-protein phospho-cytoquinones to assist immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Neuroprotective complement and antibodies such as C3a and C5a are also required against the virus infection.
For example, the antibodies of a recovered patient replace those of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overworking the immune system locally produces large radicalizations that can severely damage the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, cause multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, starting with the cluster set, is more likely to affect older people, pregnant women.
It is common for people who have been infected with a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been adapted to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on preliminary studies of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to set effective quarantine times based on the effective menstrual cycle, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected but asymptomatic people to others.
As a general practice, individuals who have been exposed to or become infected with the disease are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary symptom of COVID-19, which may occur without any symptoms or with other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle/muscle pain, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea/fever.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have rapidly progressive acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of patients with asthma was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for spina bifida, and 3% for bronchitis.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of familial clustering and clustering caused by transmission from a non-muscle patient.
Relatively, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and corresponds to a higher mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and low back pain (21%), were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (%29-75%), dyspnea (%40-42%), shortness of breath (%20-25), and spinal pain (%13) -25 were the major symptoms and fresh air was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
On 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Relatively, SARS deaths in November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The beginning of a cluster often occurs in the same family or in the same gathering or vehicle as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients from two weeks prior.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients discharged from hospitals can re-transmit the virus, which has sent a buzz to extend the quarantine time.
Patients have normal or low white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphocytic leukopenia with a white blood cell count <4 × 109 / L with a lymphocyte count of 1 × 109 / L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and veririmia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver/blood and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were increased in the blood of patients with liver disease, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte degradation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, is increased, and the lymphatic count is gradually reduced.
Abnormalities in chest radiography have been found in most COVID-19 patients and are obscured by bilateral patch shadowing or grounding opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop neuralgia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid retention, and advanced fibrosis damage the gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumonic dysfunction decrease surfactant levels and increase surface pressure, thus decreasing lung capacity and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, radiographic findings of chest defect often parallel the most severe severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 was found to show pneumitis, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multiple cytotoxic cytotoxic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the epidemiology of viral infection and similar to those of SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the disease, clinical manifestations used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) were used in China on February 13, 2020.
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is necessary for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fengyang Group described the protocol for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (per microl of int 10-100 copies) using a diptych in less than an hour without the need for a diagnostic device.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically improve sensitivity and facilitation if validated in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with unknown CoVs, clinicians may be able to provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients while trying different treatments that have been previously used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments involving antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Plasma from the patients recovered was even suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory disease and failure is a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is critical for alleviating symptoms and saving lives and includes general oxygen therapy, elevated flow oxygen, impeccable ventilation, and treatment depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiac stabilization technique used to treat life-threatening cardiac and respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electron balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and maintenance of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm results from over-activation of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a part of the systematic inflammatory response triggered by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release many of the free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunity is essential in the treatment of cytoine storms, especially in severe patients.
Cortiseroids and tosilazomab, an IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine cystitis.
Other immune therapies for cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune response modulation; inhibition of IFN-α, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokine signal transduction 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, steroids in high doses were not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting prognosis.
However, short courses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids are recommended with caution for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, vascular administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in one American patient with COVID-19.
Redmisvir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, the observations also showed possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the facility to China to conduct these paired trials on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly predictable.
In addition, barisetinib, intron α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, inflammation, bronchitis, liver damage, and other adverse interactions may occur after co-treatment with lopinavir/retrovir.
Interactions of these treatments with other drugs used for patients should be monitored closely.
Plasma of the patients received and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a chronic disease to treat other patients susceptible to the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the disease in their blood.
Antibodies are a type of immune force produced by B lymphocytes to fight infection and other foreign substances and thereby identify and directly neutralize specific molecules in a disease.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with decreased inflammatory and viral pressures and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to recommend a method for large-scale use before specific treatments have yet been developed.
Furthermore, some of the risks associated with plasma must be carefully considered, given the therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can enhance the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat serious patients.
Rapid production of specific antibodies to fight a global pandemic is very expensive.
Thus, it is highly critical and practical to isolate the B cells from the infected cell and identify the antibodies or the genetic codes or the transcription factors that are effective against the virus's essential proteins.
In this way, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a range of ailments.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of several components in a formula that is based on the ideas of TCM for disease diagnosis.
Many of the active constituents remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and verify the same constituents or their preferred compositions.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have returned from severe stages.
For example, Shenfeng Zhiyuo Capsule and Lianhu Qingwen Capsule have been found to be effective for treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningya (50%), and Hainan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only 30% of these COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is somewhat comparative as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and severity need to be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boley Jang and colleagues published a study to compare Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with the combination of WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, symptom remission, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM+ TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most effectively, the rate of symptomatic worsening (serious from light) was significantly lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM alone group than in the WM alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still pending well-controlled trials in larger scale and other centers.
It will be desirable to specify the mechanism of action and identify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience a greater fear of a more common and even deadly disease, and quarantined people also experience fatigue, loneliness, isolation and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of the disease such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and the adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to excessive anxiety and mental anguish.
During the early phase of the SARS epidemic, a range of psychiatric conditions including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic rash, psychotic symptoms, heart failure, and even suicide were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, may make people more worried and guilty about the impact of the infectious disease, quarantine, and malpractice on family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Mental support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 illness and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to interfere with the chain of transmission from animal populations and infected humans to infected organisms and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling the disease caused by the resulting viruses.
Efforts have been initiated to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-lasting and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-fed vaccines for SARS have been evaluated in animal models.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic viral infections were determined even before clinical studies could begin.
This may be because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have emerged since.
In contrast, MERS-like cases and clusters occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, with a continuing zoonotic chain in unusual locations.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and reproductive protein subunits have been developed for Mers and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to eliminate the problem because vaccine development and the dynamic mutation of CoVs require a long time (on average 18 months).
As an undiagnosed disease, COVID-19 has only begun to manifest its full clinical course across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without complications.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has also been associated with higher morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.
Therefore, developing a diagnostic model for the disease is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may be associated with or influence the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also important for COVID-19.
COVID-19 typically developed in people aged 30-65 years with 47.7% of patients aged 50 years or older in a study of 8,866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have disorders and disturbances and were significantly older than those who were not in the median age range of 66-51 years, suggesting age as a prognostic factor for outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males than females (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Disorders and disorders: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have severe cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrhythmias.
Cardiovascular events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause loss of genes/liver in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been proposed as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRV levels with COVID-19 severity and diagnosis has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are conventional markers for cardiac or renal failure.
Major clinical signs: Chest radiography and transient development of clinical signs should be considered along with other issues to predict and complicate the outcome of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants used as therapeutics for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since higher doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors suffered from ischaemic osteochondrosis with disability and poor quality of life throughout their lives.
Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As noted above, many patients have experienced unusual stress during the COVID-19 pandemic as they often endured confinement and prolonged uncertainty and witnessed the deaths of close family members and friends.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also effectively react in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomatic symptoms in the first stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period can develop a large amount of virus during daily activities, making it more difficult to control the disease.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are severely ill, whereas most transmission does not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are currently underway in China, including the ongoing quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and almost the entire population, to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions dramatically hurt the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating the severity of the disease.
The most optimistic prediction is that the epidemic will end in March and the downward phase will continue for 3-4 months.
Still, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the disease and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect up to two-thirds of the population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in both the medial and columnar trunks of patients who recovered and discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be a cyclic influenza-like event.
However, the early signs are based on the declining number of new cases occurring in China, suggesting the current strategy may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually controlled.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become weakened in infection and eventually die or remain a less virulent co-pathogen with humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 infection with SVS and Mers is provided below (Figure 55)
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing/coughing, and possibly through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in human feces, which raises the new possibility of oral-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were potentially caused by non-communicable diseases, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, precautionary measures should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even those in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the wearing of a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent potentially pathogenic droplets of fluid from traveling through the air or entering surfaces of materials, where it can be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 (series #1860) mask can protect against respiratory infections of 10 to 80 nm small viruses, with only 5% of viruses being able to enter fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks at once, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series #1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear protective clothing to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.
Thus, healthcare providers should also wear a transparent face mask or goggles when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash themselves with pesticide soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-protection and limit contact with potential infected people.
Staying three steps away from the patient is considered the appropriate distance for people.
These actions are effective methods that reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a new virus, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alertness to China due to its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of January 2020, the Director of Disease Control in Wuhan reassures citizens by saying that the novel virus has a low human-to-human transmission and is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
The message quietly eased public anxiety, especially as the whole country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and lost important time to prevent the outbreak in at least Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may learn this hard lesson and make important reforms in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word matters to the public and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinicians rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive about having a potential disease in the first place rather than giving comfort to these people; and (4) more often publish targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness about infectious diseases and periodically examine and correct the entire community's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the unknown virus SARS-CoV-2 that started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of this writing, the disease has spread to China and about 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and its symptoms are similar to those between COVID-19 and SARS, the emergence of COVID-19 has created the perception of a SARS repeat.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the treatment of the disease and the management of patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger individuals and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older individuals than in younger individuals.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (1.44% compared to 10.91%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomatic while SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, which makes COVID-19 a much bigger problem to spread than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can still test positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus transmission.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coVs of the shofar, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the shofar.
What animal was the intermediate animal that transmitted the virus from the original host to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transmission, and these events can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical transcripts have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter air cells and subsequently cause pathogenic mutations?
Has the virus also bound ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it spread globally, die like SARS or emerge at the same time as the common cold?
This is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost it may require, we have no choice but to quickly contain the pandemic and return our lives to normal.
Zoonotic origin/sources of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have co-evolved for thousands of years between coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause minor illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are coinage to illustrate how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought CoVs to the forefront once again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced infectivity compared to its cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will serve us well.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are harmless.
Intermediate sub-host of some HCoVs is also known.
Animal host recognition has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals may also yield important insights into CoV disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about seven HCoVs, with a focus on their history of discovery and their origin and cross-strain transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCoV viruses by viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this section.
In addition, the effects of viral evolution on the host requirements and severity of the disease have also been elucidated.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviridae, which is a group of closely related, positively-sensitive, uniformly-squamous RNA viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genome in the group of RNA viruses at 26 to 32 kilobases and are called "CoVs" due to their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have uncoupled genomes that share the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicator polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designed nsp1 ~ 16
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The single-stranded access protein is encoded by a different number of CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is divided into four subfamilies (A, B, C and D).
Polygenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice serve as the gene source of many alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously survived various barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha CoVs.
The other five beta CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
OC-43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause a mild symptom, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are more transmissible, causing lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with a higher chance of developing upper respiratory tract disease.
The first HCoV-229E case, B814, was isolated from a common cold strain in the mid-1960s.
Since then, much of the information has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which lead to self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until the emergence of SARS.
The SARS epidemic that emerged in 2003 is the most destructive event in recent history, infecting over 8,000 people with a case fatality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused persistent infection in the Arabian Peninsula and gradually spread to the rest of the world.
Novel 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV, subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2), is the cause of the coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world should prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from the chaperones, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show high genetic diversity
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the original sources of the HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of transitioning species.
This may facilitate the guidance or detection of SARS-CoV-2's latent, intermediate and extended animal hosts (AHOs), which have important implications in preventing future spores.
In this review we present the zoonotic origin, cross-transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we address and discuss the general theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are typically non-resistant in their natural reservoir host but become infectious after cross-transmission to a new host.
We also look at the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs in which increased transmissibility often accompanies decreased infectivity.
Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 results in this area are also discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E B814 from the respiratory tract of patients infected with the common human, various CoVs had been isolated in a variety of infected animals, including chickens, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory tract patients during 1966, and was subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have symptoms of the common cold, including headache, chills, chest pain, fever and cough that have been seen in 10 ~ 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently in the brains of lung mice by serial transcription.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which is otherwise indistinguishable from the respiratory disease triad in other areas such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and they are transmitted during the winter season in warm climates.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, and the illness lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to human volunteer studies, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E develop a common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe respiratory influenza.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first known widespread pandemic caused by HCoVs in human history and the etiological agent SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first SARS case was detected in late 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to the high transmissibility, it was estimated that each case evolves to approximately 4 secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a viral load surge occurring on the 10th day of infection.
SARS-CoV infection is first manifested with myalgia, headache, fever, pain and illness, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress with delayed symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver/blood function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase are uncommon in the SARS-like laboratory.
Reduced alveolar damage, increased epithelial cell growth and increased macrophage growth are also seen in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to the respiratory tract, numerous organs including the stomach, liver/liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, usually with cytokine storms, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found in young children, adults, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses.
The presence of choreaza, conjunctivitis, fever, and pulmonary embolism is common in HCoV-NL63 induced infection.
Another independent study described the example of an 8 month old boy in the Netherlands with pneumonia isolating the essential virus.
Although it is recognized in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed internationally.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, with its peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute ischemic disease.
HCoV-NL63, similar to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected worldwide, causing a small number of respiratory infections.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs are well normalized in humans and generally less likely to cause more severe disease, while outbreaks have been caused by unknown causes such as those caused by the more viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63.
Generally, once these HCoVs have acquired the abilities to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves in humans continuously, they also become less dangerous or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases have occasionally been reported in various European countries and Tunisia with close secondary contact.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe renal failure, which is more typical of Mers in HCoV-induced infections.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and inflammation.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, a high of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV the most deadly virus known to humans.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients with a known SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The ongoing outbreak of respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, which also named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of cases being deaths that have not been confirmed.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness similar to CoV and MERS-CoV, which present as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly similar due to an 82% higher nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster in different branches of the phylagenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less carcinogenic but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals many beneficial differences.
First, the incubation period and the infection period of HCoVs are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit forms that are more commonly seen during infections with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of nonspecific, mild or even asymptomatic presence.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting ways in which community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs both exhibit characteristics.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than that of at least the community-acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission in humans as seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 must be detected in fecal samples.
However, the ovarian oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as may be clarified by future studies, at least in some cases, in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is of particular interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 may have seasonal expression as in community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 variant will be influential in the eventual fate of the ongoing COVID-19, including its transmission, disease and continued spread after its passage in humans.
Four community-acquired HCoVs that cause the symptoms of the disease have been well adapted in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have shown good adaptation to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the previous HCoV outbreak.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans. and humans that have caused severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans sufficiently to allow for adaptive mutations that combat host-constraint factors.
This means that, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more people it infects, the greater the chance that it will become fully transmissible to humans.
If it is well controlled, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, becoming the common cold in immunocompromised subjects.
These viruses do not require animal deposits.
In contrast, advanced cancers - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV - are not well tolerated in humans and cannot continue to transmit them in humans.
They need to be preserved and propagated in their zoonotic reservoir and look for opportunities to promote suspicious human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and advanced hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has a form that is similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is much less pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it would serve us well to discuss the evolution, natural reservoir, intermediate and diffusion host definition and characteristics of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for an HCoV if it is related to close relatives that share high homology in terms of nucleotide sequence.
The old virus is often well-adapted to this host and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the host of the reservoir retains HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoVs or the parent of the virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV is introduced to a medium host before or around its introduction to humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often infectious.
These intermediate hosts can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of host by transmitting via the virus and then transmitting to humans by increasing the rate of human infection.
HCoV can carry out a deadly infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can coexist with intermediate hosts and even produce long-term infectivity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the natural reservoir.
A look at epidemiological data revealed that the SARS index case had a history of contact with animals.
Subsequent Surprisingness studies have shown that pet traders have higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
Masked cats (Pygoma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were first identified as transmitting SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that there were no further SARS reports after killing all the cattle in the market.
However, it has been reported that masked parrot fish from the wild or farms were largely negative for SARS-CoV without reaching animal markets, suggesting that masked parrot fish may only be intermediate hosts but not natural reservoirs of CoV-SARS.
Significantly, since 80% of the different animals in markets in Guangzhou have antibodies against SARS-CoV, the possibility that small vertebrate species may also serve as intermediate host for SARS-CoV is high.
All of these appear to be end-hosts of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV has revealed a closely related CoV evening parrot in search of a natural host, the SARS-related RhCoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese Horseshoe bats.
These candidates are positive for the SARS-RH-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence and SARS-CoV antibodies.
These and other super-covers share a nucleotide sequence homology of 92-88% with SARS-CoV.
These studies formed the basis of the new idea that insects host the emergent human corgias.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the evening parakeet, but with the exception of one virus identified as WIV1, none of them can be isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 strain of the virus is contained in uncatalysed samples of the caterpillar feces, which use the caterpillar, the marten and the human ACE2 receptor as a means of entering the cell.
Notably, the serum or blood serum of SARS-recovered patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in the evening primate, with 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Although there are many similarities between these two viruses, the general consensus is that WIV1 is not the close parent virus of SARS-CoV and that the caterpillar is not the close host host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis and parallelization classify MERS-CoV into the same group as the evening-after viral CoV-HKU4 and the evening-after viral CoV-HKU5.
Both evening-old CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host, diptepidal peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
RNAThe sequence of RNA polymers associated with MERS-CoV are phylogenetically close to the homology of the evening primordial beta-CoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been detected in wild-caught bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity to evening primrose CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, evening primates are probably not the closest host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arabian camels have tested positive for MERS-CoV-specific inhibition antibodies, similar to the Middle Eastern camels of the Arabian in many African countries.
A similar organism to the virus found in humans, MERS-CoV, has been isolated from the fecal fluids of the Arabian camel, suggesting that the camel is the main host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that for experimentation MERS-CoV-infected mice generally showed mild symptoms but had more widespread viral transmission.
It is worth noting that infected camels not only transmit respiratory viruses but also fecal-oral transmission, which is also the primary route of transmission of the virus in the evening primates.
However, questions remain as to whether most confirmed cases of MERS have a history of camel-to-camel contact prior to the onset of symptoms, apparent human-to-human transmission, or attribution to unknown routes of transmission including unknown animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the Rhinolephus aphenis evening primrose has a nucleotide similarity of 96.2% to the evening primrose CoV RaTG13.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence difference or spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the genetic relationship.
This means that evening primates may not be a safe host for SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar evening primate coronavirus is discovered in the near future.
Presumably, the intermediate host animal of SARS-CoV-2 should be somewhere between wild animals bought and slaughtered at the Han'an seafood wholesale market, to which many of the early COVID-19 cases were linked, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
A number of recent studies on the metagenomic sequence suggest that the endangered small animal known as the mammal (Manis yavannica) may also have inherited beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These genomes of the novel pangolin CoV share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2 in homology.
They are similarly related to RaTG13 but more closely related at the level of nucleotide sequence with about 90% similarity.
In their paleogenetic tree, viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are grouped into two subfamilies, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RBD) very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
Significantly, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are highly variable, albeit with a genome-wide homology sequence size.
An earlier study of infected cattle had also reported the discovery of viral disease in cattle from the fever, similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used various methods of assembly and manually reconstructed to produce three-level genome sequences with a composition of approximately 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot ignore the possibility that the monkey is one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present, due to the differential sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the related beta-CoVs of the SARS-CoV-2, there is no direct supporting evidence for the origin between the SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and its mosquito-like cousin SARS-CoV-2 associated with beta-CoVs.
The pathway of SARS-CoV-2 growth in rats, rodents and other animals has not yet been identified.
While a high degree of homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the RBDs has been found, the related beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share a high degree of genome-wide sequence homology.
It is highly likely that the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs of the monkey and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the increased convergence of the preferred intermediates.
Another proposal would favor replication between the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As a growth driver, replication is more prevalent among beta-CoVs.
Conclusion on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still far off.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied for animal origin.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from a mixture of CoVs, while the hereditary viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in the mouse family.
A spike co-virus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in the North American triple-colored spike has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another strain of CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, found in Ghana, while the camel family is suspected as the intermediate host.
For clarity, the current available information on the origin of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Paleogenetic analyses have historically offered evidence for the occurrence of transmissions of HCoVs between animals.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed from domestic animals to humans around 1890, a respiratory infectious disease outbreak was recorded.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between animals is less clear.
Several alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among these is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
A number of different lines of evidence support the evidence of transmission of viruses between cats and humans.
First, there may be a link between humans and alpacas in the ecological domain.
However, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E variant related to the alpaca alpha-CoVs is not causing infection in the alpaca, whereas the alpaca alpha-CoVs caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
Consequently, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be ignored that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, mosquitoes are a direct source of human infectious viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the strain could transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while the alpha-CoVs of the rat serve as the source of the HCoV-229E's inheritance, the alpaca and the camel may be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as the case of MERS-CoV demonstrates.
The transmission of MERS-CoV from a wild camel to a wild camel to humans is a good example.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from the rat was identified early on and has been supported in recent findings.
It is clear that the vector for transmission of genetic material between animals is a rich source of inter-animal viruses.
Longevity, overcrowding, close social ties and strong flight ability are all supporting conditions that make mosquitoes suitable virus vectors.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been transmitted to a single batch of camels over the decades.
It has adapted well to these animals, evolving from an intermediate host into a stable and natural resource.
MERS-CoV causes a low level of disease and maintains a low mutation rate in these animals.
This random transmission to humans is an isolated event and humans are the end hosts of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike camel flies in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the contribution of the monkey is different, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, the sister beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in monkeys.
In the case of SARS-CoV to feline families, they may be end hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
Different conditions for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, the strain may be the source of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have an ecological common ground with butchery or coal mining trails.
Second, it is possible that the mosquitoes are an excess intermediate host to which the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has been recently transmitted.
Humans are infected by the virus through butchering and eating the flesh of game.
Many animals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals is required for antibodies.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have been initiated in tertiary animals that have interactions with both vertebrates and amphibians.
The search for an animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also ongoing.
Apart from the different host animal species, three virologically important factors are also important for facilitating the transmission of CoVs to animals.
First, their high mutation rates in RNA replication are mostly due to their high mutation rates.
Compared to other single RNA viruses, the predicted mutation rate of CoVs can range from "medium" to "high", with a median mutation rate of ~10-4 per 2 sites per year, depending on the stage of the new host CoV.
CoVs have exoribonuclease editing, which results in high mutation and reduced or no persistence.
Significantly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir has been shown to inhibit CoV replication by this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is too promising against SARS-CoV-2 agents to be clinically tested.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is nearly one million times higher than that of their hosts.
Furthermore, the mutation rate is higher when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
The higher rate of mutation compared to SARS-CoV, is seen to be lower in SARS-CoV-2, which means higher rates of adaptation with humans.
It may have been adapted to a host closest to humans in the past.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also relevant for MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to a buck's urine.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic modification will render vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and antivirals ineffective anytime soon.
Second, the large RNA genome replication pathway in CoVs uses greater flexibility in genome replication, thus increasing the likelihood of cross-over between animals, when conditions are right, to be conducive to the emergence of new CoVs.
This is supported by 3′-encoded open reading frames at the end of the genome and a more specific function of proteins.
Third, CoVs change irregular and repeating templates during RNA replication through a specific "reproduction selection" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a common container, strand mutation occurs frequently during CoV registration of RNA.
High-level similar full-length and sub-genomic RNA genes can be recombined to produce new CoV genes.
Paleogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as the rat SL-CoV and the rat CoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-host relationships
In addition to the three viral agents mentioned above, animal-to-animal transmission is the virus's interaction with the host.
Therefore, SARS-CoV reverse transcriptase was taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive mutation during animal-to-animal transmission events.
Based on comparative analyses between human and rat SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly in RBD mutations of the S protein.
Typically, the RBD of the S protein of a CoV binds to the cell receptor and is automatically selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD in the S1 fragment is in the 318th to 510th amino acids that connect the human ACE2 and its co-receptors to the viral entry.
SARS-CoV, RBD can recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including rats, cats, mice and wild dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted between animals.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues in RBD differed from those in humans and wild rats and 4 were located in the receptor-binding scheme for binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Rat SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein for the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, mutations in these two amino acids may be important for the virus to adapt to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 is said to have similar cellular receptors to SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that human affinity for the S protein binding to ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, one cryo-EM study showed a 10 to 20 percent higher rate of binding affinity, than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to investigate whether any of the peer receptors may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a single S-linked component.
There are several HCoV receptors, such as the N amino peptide for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylsalicylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be considered for the successful habituation of these CoVs after their animal-to-animal transmission from a host.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of the spread of HCoVs among animals is also governed by other host needs and limiting factors.
The differentiation of these host proteins between HCoVs such as bats, monkeys, camels, mice, humans and natural resource hosts may act as a barrier to transmission between animals.
For successful animal-to-animal spread, HCoVs must overcome the host requirement and eliminate the host restriction factors.
Therefore, molecular factors in this critical area of virus-infected interaction have yet to be identified and explained.
The use of state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be useful for genome-wide neutral assay of SARS-CoV-2 host needle and barrier factors.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to basics
More variants of the HCoVs provide more opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
Therefore, the fecal HCoVs are the source of the HCoVs gene pool.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also contribute to HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the sequence.
For example, acquiring or losing new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter viral genotype.
Among SARS-CoV-associated proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-associated covalent viruses have been isolated but found to encode different proteins of ORF8.
A 29-nucleotide sequence characteristic of SARS-CoVs can be found in isolated viruses of the human origin of infectious diseases.
This removal isolates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a normal mutation in inducing host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombinant history with the family of alpha and gamma-CoVs, where RNA-dependent RNA polymers have been found to recombine.
Reverse splicing sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that MERS-CoV infection has experienced recombination between different families, originating in a camel from Saudi Arabia.
In addition, cases of recombination of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-natural structure genes.
It should also be noted that artificial inhibition may contribute to the unintended modification of the viral genome, largely as a result of selective induced stresses, such as the release of viruses by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While complete ORF4 can be observed in monkey and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the inclusion of alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide, resulting in a mutation.
Consequently, the growth of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their host reservoirs.
Asymptomatic disease or only mildly symptomatic disease has been found when bats have been infected with CoVs, indicating co-infection between CoVs and bats.
The mice appear to be well adapted to CoVs both automatically and physiologically.
For example, disorders in the activity of the inflammatory response in vertebrates actively reduce pathogen activation by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in the spleen is inhibited by uptake of natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and by inhibition of low-level principal equivalent I molecules.
In addition, the high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced due to the high metabolic activity of the strains may both prevent CoV regrowth and the effects of exoribonuclease by correcting, thus providing a catastrophic pressure to produce when the highly pathogenic virus is transferred to a new host.
More pathogenic CoVs can mutate by recombination, and take on new proteins or protein forms to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause disease in their host organisms such as mice and camels.
They reproduce rapidly without the host's security system responding strongly.
So there is a mystery as to why asymptomatic patients are seen and what causes severe cases in humans to become infected.
Severe symptoms are primarily due to an increased immune response and cytokine storm, i.e., the stronger the immune response, the greater the lung damage.
In other words, the immune response in asymptomatic patients is isolated from the CoV replication.
Similar strategies for isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interference response in rats is particularly strong.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon in early stages of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the spleen has implications.
By this argument, inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat-type beta-CoV has been found to share 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat-type bat-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide structure with SARS-CoV-2.
While cats and other animals have been found in markets to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the proximal intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
The beta-CoVs of the moth are found to be more similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the moth may serve as intermediate hosts or that the beta-CoVs of the moth may contribute to the gene fragmentation in the resulting SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have become common again due to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in rats and other animals have greatly changed our understanding of the transmission of HCoVs to humans and the importance of sedimentation and zoonotic origin in animals.
Overall evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the main causative strains and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV is a human-cat interaction in markets, the closure of the markets and the killing of the cats could have effectively eliminated the SARS outbreak.
On the basis of the same reasoning, honeybees should be kept in wet markets to prevent animal transmission, as honeybees beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of associations have been found.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 spreads to humans via the fruit fly or other animals is to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around for a long time in single-camel populations.
These camels serve as an important source of transportation for the local population as well as the central source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely available in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in the wet markets of China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the re-emergence of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV in addition to other spread control measures for camels.
Since we cannot eliminate the virus, new genotypes can be created and spread.
There are many varieties of CoVs in the wild.
Especially the tetanus CoVs have a lot of variation with animal potential.
There are many opportunities for these animal-derived CoVs to mutate and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible in the future and/or deadly in humans.
The culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be discouraged to reduce the need for interaction between humans and animals.
A preparedness and response plan should be developed for the challenges of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
In fact, there have been many viruses in the world for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until they have a chance to spread.
Although cats have many features that help the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with cats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring from animals is necessary to gain understanding of the environment of CoVs and the natural environment of the host, which will prove useful in preventing future animal-to-human spread.
Consequently, the most effective way for humans to prevent zoonotic viruses is to move away from the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses in the environment.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 animal origin puzzle are still missing.
First, if vertebrates transmit SARS-CoV-2 to apes, it would be interesting to see under what conditions vertebrates and apes could share the same respiratory tract.
Second, if insects are directly involved in transmission to humans, it must be understood how humans come into contact with animals.
Third, if a third animal acts as the primary intermediate host, how it interacts with various animals including humans, mammals, and amphibians must be clarified.
Consequently, since many animals including domestic animals may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental deployment should be undertaken.
Whether it is a cat, a mammal, or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its closely related viruses will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will be important in the outcome of the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria data for COVID-19 "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, we published a rapid advisory guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic, and these guidelines have informed our experience and provide good information for the fight against this common infectious disease worldwide.
However, as 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge is increasing regularly based on the results of ongoing research and clinical trials; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we provide a commentary on our guidelines and propose new diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", based on the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition), published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to emerge, now officially named coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a public health epidemic.
To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed an emergency advisory guide and on 06 February 2020 it was published online in Military Medical Research.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge and understanding is constantly increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical trials; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven versions with some parts significantly modified.
Now that our guidelines have been taken up by Zhou et al., they have suggested a score based on their annual experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidance and is valuable information for this common infectious disease.
We acknowledge their hard work and express our gratitude.
However, their work data should also be updated to reflect the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (trial version) and the latest studies.
As of the seventh edition (3 March 2020), two items of clinical evidence must be combined with a history of infection to confirm a suspected case to form a comprehensive analysis, or three items of clinical evidence must be completed if there is no apparent history of infection.
History of infection: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan City and Surrounding Areas, or in communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the past 14 days prior to the outbreak; (2) History of contact with SARS-CoV-2 outbreak cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) History of contact with patients from Wuhan City and Surrounding Areas, or in communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the past 14 days prior to the outbreak with a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms; (4) History of contact with confirmed case groups with ≥ 1 case to 2 cases with fever/pneumonia in a local area, such as a school, office, or other place of work.
Clinical signs: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) infection with COVID-19 with imaging; (3) abnormal, decreased, or decreased white blood cell counts in the early stages of onset.
A diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence materials: (1) real-time PCR positive test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high similarity to novel coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibody and SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody in serum test; or positive for specific IgM antibody for SARS-CoV-2; or ≥4 material in the good phase versus the severe phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenetic identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in the eighth edition.
These changes are due to the ongoing work of researchers to investigate the detection of high levels of nucleic acid for rapid diagnosis, and the collection of blood samples including those from the respiratory tract, which has added to the availability of differentiated samples, and has supported the delivery of unique positive results in a validated standard.
In addition, there is additional evidence that we should treat both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with care.
Therefore, the working group data of Zhou et al. should be updated, as those without clinical signs were classified as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in other clinical work and studies.
As a result, we are eager to see more conclusive evidence and ask readers to give their input.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend to follow and comply with the new guidelines of your own countries.
Our team updated our guide in time to offer help.

On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, Australian retail chain Wolverines and Coles eased restrictions on toilet paper sales, with all stores nationally selling two or one pack at a time.
ALDI also introduced a new package limit on Monday.
The restrictions were posted in the form of warning messages on the exit sites and the chain's Facebook page.
Shoppers reportedly avoided quarantine due to COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also lowered the limit for buying toilet paper for the home by one pack.
These changes followed the introduction of the four-bed, single-dose shotgun that had been introduced by Wolverth and Cooles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In a media report on March 8, Coles said that these four packages were limited, "most stores sell out their items within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented", while Aldi called the Facebook post on Tuesday "unusual".
A spokesman for Woolworths said sales were "very high" last week.
Costco Store in Canberra also restricted the permitted quantity to two last week.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles asked suppliers for larger packages and increased supplies, Woolworths ordered additional stock, and Aldi made stock available for a planned special on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Retail Federation of Australia, said retailers are trying to increase stock, but are having difficulty due to curbs on the timing of the rollout by the local council.
He expects the product's prices to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand and what's special.
On Tuesday, Alde announced that after the stock had expired, some stores would not be able to operate the special Wednesday.
Dr. Gary Mortimer of the Queensland University of Technology reported on News.com.au that the stores were filling up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky material, and is of low quality, and when used, it can free up space in large cabinets, giving a sense of stock shortage.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Clouse and Woolworths have an opinion that if there are more items in the closet, and if there are more items like toilets and sanitiser, there may be less risk.
The recycled toilet paper giant said Wednesday that it was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Clinics toilet tissue and Solaris paper surgeon, told News.com that the pair worked 24/7 to restore supplies.
The real estate website Domain.com reported that property agents in Melbourne had offered free toilet paper to the first bidders, after a series of auctions were held due to labour shortages.
The eighth page of the Thursday edition of the Darwin daily, the IT News, was used as toilet paper.
The Australian BBC reported on 3 March that the stores were not in favour of the bans, and had no plans to ban the items.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other items is also high, including masks, sanitizers, dryers, handwashers and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday, the British online supermarket Andersen saw toilet paper buy 12 rolls of Pex.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared an outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection.
If the epidemic is spreading beyond the epidemic, not to mention the seriousness of the events, the World Health Organization has ordered governments to take action.
Entire countries can still change the outbreak period.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that if countries responded by discovering, testing, treating, isolating and empowering their people, then the world would be better off.
We are very concerned about the dangerous spread and severity of the coronavirus and the lack of action to combat it.
Former US director of disease control and prevention, Dr Tom Friedan, said the pandemic was "unprecedented".
In an analysis published by CNN in February, he said that the influenza virus was the only virus that had spread globally.
Gibrisos also shared his analysis, saying that Mungi had not previously encountered an outbreak like the coronavirus outbreak.
He said, "Mong has not seen an outbreak that he could have contained at that time".
The new pandemic situation is in line with the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the pandemic a global public health emergency.
The head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the epidemic was likely to get worse at the low end.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that of the 160,000 people infected with the coronavirus, about 4,600 had died.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the continuation of the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the country declared a national health emergency on December 30 due to international concerns, and was reclassified as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.60 million cases of coronavirus have been reported in 210 countries, resulting in more than 97,000 deaths.
More than 364,000 people have recovered from the disease.
The mortality rate was recorded at 4% in China, and 13.04% worldwide, 0.08% in Algeria, and 0.08% in New Zealand.
General symptoms include fever, dehydration, and fatigue.
The severe and complex disease is characterized by pneumonia, obstruction of the respiratory system, and dysfunction of many organs resulting in weakness or death.
Symptoms usually appear within five days of infection, but in some cases it can take two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the new coronavirus.
While initial treatment is helpful to provide symptomatic relief and support, recommended precautions are important, such as hand washing, taking coughing supplies to the room, social distancing, and self-isolation for people with suspected infections.
Globally, authorities have implemented travel bans, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls, and other measures.
The pandemic caused severe economic and social disruption worldwide, including the cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and a sharp decline in the transmission of HIV.
Universities and schools were closed in all 193 countries on a national or local basis, affecting about 99.4% of the world's students.
Online references to the virus were shared with misinformation, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, including people of East and Southeast Asian descent, and areas of concern for the virus.
Reduced travel and the closure of large factories have led to a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Most cases are associated with Hunan seafood and the virus is thought to be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the coronavirus, the pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV, the first person to be infected on 1 December 2019 was not associated with Westchester Market.
Two-thirds of the cases first reported in December 2019 were found to have been linked to Markit.
In China, unconfirmed reports in the South China Morning Post newspaper on 13 March 2020 stated that the province of Ha Noi had recorded 55 cases on 17 November 2019, while the WHO reported a decrease in outbreaks in China on 26 February 2020, but reported an increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Cases may be underreported, especially in cases with minor symptoms.
On 26 February, the few cases reported in adolescents, including those aged 19 and under, were 2.4% of the world, with the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimating that 60% of the UK population should be immunised before the disease.
The number of cases refers to people who have been tested for COVID-19.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, with most countries having policies that it will not test patients with low symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
According to a study published on March 16, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected by January 23, and that the non-communicable infection was the source for 79% of cases.
The number of cases in Italy is higher than reported, according to a statistical analysis published on 30 March.
The primary reproductive rate (RO) of COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests it may be 5.7.
More people are getting sick from COVID-19.
The incubation period for recovery is 6 to 41 days, and for the most common population, 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97.000 billion deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, 80% of deaths as of 5 February were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing heart disease and diabetes, generally the official COVID-19 pandemic protocol for testing positive deaths.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher, as it would not include people who died without being tested, for example in homes, nursing homes, and other places.
Preliminary data from Italy show that the death toll from COVID-19 is 5x-4 times higher than the official death toll.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has acknowledged that the number of deaths has decreased, but has reported that the number of confirmed cases in the US has decreased, similar to the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009.The first confirmed deaths in Wuhan City were on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside of Mainland China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
28 February Outside mainland China, dozens of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
With deaths reported in more than 40 countries and territories as of 13 March, and on every continent except Antarctica, more generalized measures have been taken to quantify deaths.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of trials, quality of care, treatment options, time after the first incident, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health; the ratio of deaths per incident reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.0% as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
The mortality rate in China has been reduced from 17.3% of people (who had it from 1 January to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (who had it from 1 February 2020).The next steps include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from the disease, and the case incidence rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from the disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
The sensation is not time-limited and is followed by infection-to-resolution in particular populations.
A number of academic institutions have attempted to use these data for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre based on medical evidence estimated the disease prevalence for the outbreak to be between 0.1% and 0.39.
In Germany, the highest measure of this range is the COVID-19 diagnosis, and a statistical study measured the effectiveness of the diagnosis in CFR.
The World Health Organization has indicated that the outbreak is controllable.
The frequency and timing of the disease is uncertain and varies by location.
Penn State University's Maciej Boni says that uncontacted infection typically begins with a phyto-and then declines when the disease leaves an existing host.
But it is not possible to make any intelligent prediction now as to when it will be.
The Chinese government's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nashan, argues that this will end by June, if all countries follow the advice of the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Typical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be eradicated within one or two years.
In the Imperial College study, Neil Ferguson says that it would have required social distancing and other precautions "until vaccines were available (at 18 months or older)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus - because it is so easily transmitted - will disappear completely and it is possible that it will turn into a seasonal disease, which will come back every year".
The return of the virus will depend on the degree of immunity and mutation.
COVID-19 is relatively undetectable and patients may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are a fever of 88% and a chronic constipation of 68%.
Less common symptoms include fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, coughing, headache, chronic illness, coughing, hemorrhoids, dyspepsia or psychosis.The World Health Organization says that one in six people become ill and have difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a list of acute symptoms that include respiratory distress, chest pain or pressure, sudden drowsiness, difficulty in getting up, and swelling of the face or back. Immediate medical attention is recommended for those with these symptoms. The disease can also cause severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, subconjunctival shock, and death.
The patients would be asymptomatic and not clinically evident, but would show disease in the diagnosis, advising that anyone who had been in close contact with the patients should be monitored and investigated for infection.
China has a 44% asymptomatic disease rate.
The time between symptoms and infection is 14 days, with the exception of cases where the sensitivity of COVID-19 is 30% and 15% respectively.
Some explanations of how the disease is spread are still being worked out.
The disease is spread by contact with people in close proximity, such as droplets in the air, coughing, or talking to people within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft) of one another.
The findings suggest that the virus can be transmitted from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft) by coughing in the open air.
Some suggest that the virus can also be transmitted in the form of tiny air droplets as they can remain airborne for hours, although the droplets are not released during speech, and respiratory droplets are released during breathing but not during speech.
The particles can be absorbed into the mouth or nose of nearby individuals or may be transported to the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) also aerosolize respiratory fluids and release them into the air.
The virus can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, including skin, the eyes, nose, and mouth.
There is also concern that the disease could be spread through wastewater, but this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 could have been caused by contamination.The virus is most contagious in the last three days after symptoms appear, but there is a possibility that it could spread before the symptoms appear and the disease is in its late stages.
People who tested positive for the disease three days before the onset of the epidemic are at risk of transmission before significant symptoms develop.
There are only laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during link-finding investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has said that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detected in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, in cardboard for one day, and in copper for up to four hours.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, such as with other surfaces that may have been exposed to the disease.
Severe and fragile respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel virus first isolated from three patients with severe respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All strains of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the related coronavirus in nature.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the family's soap, which breaks down its protective envelope.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS.
The virus is said to have originated from animals.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronaviruses are genetically clustered together with the genus beta coronavirus in the subgenus Sarbivirus (genus B) with two double-stranded strains.
It is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between pangolins and human viruses in some parts of the genome sequence.
A comparison of the full genome with dataset found that relatively 92% of the genetic material was shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove pangolin to be the intermediate host.
Infection by a virus can be diagnosed only briefly based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately by imaging the polymerase chain reaction of the infected product or by CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its responses were overlapped with other pneumonia and pathology processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for first-line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breath or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
In general the test is done on a nasopharyngeal swab while a colonic swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies run serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
The serological test developed by Celex in the United States is only approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) that are symptomatic include an asymmetrical peripheral grid appendix and absent optimistic factor
The Italian Society of Radiologists maintains a global online database of radiation findings for confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in the detection of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT scans to PCR and revealed that although the response is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its attention as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Robust artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect viral responses with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, prohibiting contact with hands, nose and mouth, and coughing or sneezing and throwing tissue directly into a sewage container.
Those who may already have the infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been proposed to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or advised all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak
However, the virus has reached the point of spreading in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected. Healthcare providers are alerting those who may be using standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised by governments' use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose, with Amnesty International and 100 other organisations calling for restrictions on such surveillance in a statement.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 2020, 20 expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to connect users with other mobile phones in close proximity.
Users are then notified if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misconceptions are spreading about how to prevent infection.For example, nasal rinsing and mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although several organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly wet; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or coughing.
Because it is outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks down its protective bubble.
The CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization tells people not to touch their eyes, nose or throat unless they wash their hands.
The faces can be disinfected with a number of solvents (expose the stainless steel face to a disinfectant for at least one minute) that include 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% iodine.
Other solvents such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that all rooms, restrooms, shared meeting areas, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, desks, remote controls and ATM machines that a patient may have used in an office or other facility where there is a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that you cover your mouth and nose with a gauze or a cloth when coughing or sneezing, and then apply the cloth immediately.
Surgical drying may be recommended for individuals who are infected with the virus, as the drying may reduce the volume of their exhalation droplets and the ability to travel when they cough, sneeze or talk.
The World Health Organization recommends when and how to use masks.
Leeds University virologist Stephen Graffen suggests that wearing a mask may help people avoid touching their faces, but not washing their hands properly is the most serious risk.Masks may also be recommended for people who care for or protect sick people.
The WHO advises masks to patients who are at high risk, such as those caring for people with COVID-19, and acknowledges that wearing masks may prevent them from touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of masks in public.
In the United States, the CDC has recommended wearing non-medical face coverings that are not made of fabric; China has recommended that healthy individuals in particular wear non-medical face coverings when in close proximity to others (1 m (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong has advised the wearing of surgical masks when travelling or staying in crowded public transport.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to wash their face at home and then bathe daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, there is a ban on leaving without weapons or without covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam urged all citizens to take precautions when leaving the country to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government made it mandatory for anyone entering the store to wear a face mask.
Israel urged all citizens to wear face coverings when outdoors.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million passengers daily since mid-March, has imposed a new toll on passengers on inter-city buses from 1 April.
Panama has assumed that the use of face masks will be mandatory when going out and has already advised those who cannot afford masks to prepare masks at home.
Facial tattoos are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves the practice of controlling contagion to minimize the spread of disease by reducing the proximity between people.
The measures include self-isolation, restrictions on travel and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, fairs and markets.
Individuals should practice self-care by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding going out to the street, avoiding greeting each other and avoiding other people.
Many governments are mandating or advising social distancing in areas that have not been affected by the disease.
The US government and health organizations have recommended reducing the number of cases immediately from 250 (if there is no COVID-19 outbreak in the region) to 50 and then to 10.
On 22 March, Germany banned gatherings of two or more people, stating that older adults and those undergoing treatment for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illness, hypertension, and weakened immune systems were at higher risk of severe disease, as the CDC advised more stay-at-home in the outbreak zone.In March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies recommended changing the title of the term "social distancing" to "physical distancing", to reflect the intent of reducing physical contact with those who are sick, if they were punished, and if they were at a distance.
The term "social distancing" has been used to imply that people should be isolated from each other, rather than encouraging others to contact one another in the same way.Some authorities have also issued guidance on sexual health during the pandemic.
The specific recommendation is to have sex with a partner who is not infected or has symptoms of the virus.
Special home isolation is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having the disease.
Health agencies provide detailed guidance for appropriate isolation.Most governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine in the affected area.
Tighter self-quarantine guidelines have been put in place for the most at-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19 and those who have traveled to a country or region where the virus is highly prevalent in the recent past are also advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from that day.
Mitigation or containment and reduction in the spread level are included in the policies to control the outbreak.
Virus containment is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak to identify and isolate people infected with the virus, as well as to determine the level of control and vaccine components to prevent further infection.
When it is impossible to contain the disease, efforts are made to reduce the spread of the disease: measures are taken to reduce the spread and limit the impact of the disease on the community and the health system.
It is also possible that the latter stages of containment and mitigation can be achieved simultaneously.
Elimination requires more drastic measures to reduce the epidemic to a baseline of less than 1.A key part of managing an outbreak of a contagious disease is to try to reduce the transmission rate of the epidemic, called the outbreak rate.
This reduces the risk to health services that are already out of reach and provides additional time for other therapeutic services and vaccine development.
Medications that can control the spread of the virus are individual protective measures such as hand washing, mask wearing, and self-quarantine; and social measures that include social distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; and community acceptance of these restrictions and encouragement of people's participation in these measures; as well as sanitary measures such as surface cleaning.When the severity of the virus outbreak became apparent, China took all the necessary measures to contain the outbreak, including complete quarantines of cities and severe restrictions on travel.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has asked all of its people to quarantine and issued strict warnings to those with the disease to stay away.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who had self-quarantined and fined those who had not quarantined.
Taiwan increased production of masks and fined those who used them.The similarities between the UK and the US show that there are significant challenges in mitigating the virus (reducing the level of transmission) and in eradicating the virus (preventing further spread).
The virus mitigation policy may reduce the demand for health services by two thirds and the death rate by half, but it could still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the destruction of health services.
The best approach is to continue to contain the virus until it is present in the population (and until a vaccine is developed), but if the measures are stopped, the virus will return soon.
Long-term restrictions to contain the virus are causing social and economic damage.
There is no specific antiviral drug for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking medication, drinking fluids, and resting can help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the use of synthetic oxygen, serum, and respiratory system strength are necessary for the recovery of the patient.
The results can be ruined by repeated use.
Many compounds that were for other viral diseases have also been investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has said that certain "casual and family therapies" can provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has outlined increased capacity and health care measures for COVID-19 patients.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines to hospitals, primary health care providers, and healthcare providers at various levels, including focusing on COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitals.
Many theories can be formulated.
The first confirmed case of coronavirus was reported in Oubei, Wuhan, China, on 1 December 2019.
Hubei saw a steady increase in coronavirus cases in a month.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, which also sells live animals, and a theory that the virus came from such animals, in other words, that it was of a zoonotic origin, emerged on 26 December due to an unknown cluster of pneumonia and the WHO was informed.
On 30 December, a team of doctors warned their colleagues at Wuhan Central Hospital of the SARS outbreak coronavirus.
The eight doctors, including Le Vin Liang, were disgraced by the police and other Al-Fan leaders for spreading false rumours.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public alert and informed the World Health Organization on 31 December.
The unidentified case of pneumonia in Wuhan last January was reported to health authorities for full investigation that, in the early part of the outbreak, the number of cases was one to two every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, including the Chinese New Year migration hub Wuhan and the major railway exchange destinations.
On 20 January, China reported 140 cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,147 people had symptoms as of 20 January 2020.On 26 March, China and the United States had the highest number of cases reported globally, with more than 1.61 million cases reported globally on 9 April 2020, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 36,400 recoveries.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one incident.
Following the outbreak in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have adopted free movement and have tightened controls on the border.
Nationally, measures include evacuation (such as curfews, stay-at-home orders, or lockdowns) and travel restrictions.As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown in the United States, 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59% of people in South Africa and 1.3 million people in India are in lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later - one third of the world's population.
The first known case of the coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China, on 1 December 2019.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 27 December 2019, preliminary genetic tests on patients confirmed the presence of the coronavirus as a SARS-like virus.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public alert and informed the World Health Organization on 31 December.
The same information was also given to the World Health Organization.
When the outbreak occurred, Wuhan police doctors were alerted to the spread of outbreak rumours.
Initially, China's National Health Commission claimed that there was no clear evidence that the virus was transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a grassroots campaign called People's War by then Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping that included the spread of the virus.
In the Wuhan quarantine, the largest in human history, a health services belt was established on 23 January that closed all travel to and from Wuhan city, and then extended to 15 other cities in the Hubei region, affecting approximately 57 million people.
The use of private cars was also banned in the city.
Celebrations of the Chinese New Year (January 25) were cancelled in most places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a makeshift hospital, the Hoshien-Shan Hospital, which was built in ten days.
A second hospital, Li Shen Shan, was later built to accommodate the additional patients.
In addition to building new hospitals, China converted 14 other service areas in Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as community centers and stadiums.On 26 January, the Chinese government introduced some other measures to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19, including health notices for travellers and the extension of spring break.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions specifically implemented a number of measures related to schools and universities.
Measures for remote working have also been implemented in many regions of China.
Travel restrictions and travel restrictions to Hubei were imposed.
Public transport was restricted and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Most cities had controlled public movement, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) were subject to curfews.After the virus outbreak reached global levels in March, Chinese authorities implemented a series of measures to prevent the virus from entering China from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-hour mandatory quarantine for all international travelers.On March 3, only one person had been transported across China in the previous five days from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 3 March 2020, Premier Li Keqiang said that the transmission of the virus from foreign countries to China had stopped and the outbreak had been brought under control in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions on the entire Hubei region from outside Wuhan were lifted after a two-month ban.On 26 March 2020, China's Foreign Ministry announced that visa and visa application would be suspended from 28 March, but did not share specific details about the end of the policy.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa through the embassies or consulates in their respective countries.
The Chinese government encouraged all businesses and enterprises to resume their operations on March 30, and provided financial support to companies.The Chinese State Council set April 4 as a national day of mourning that began with a three-minute silence at 10 a.m., although the central government asked families to submit their orders online, taking into account physical distancing due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was transmitted from China to South Korea on 20 January 2020.
The National Health Authority announced a high spike in reported cases of the virus on 20 February, largely due to the overcrowding at a religious movement called Shincheon-ji, a Church of Jesus in Daegu.

When the Roman Catholic bishop closed his churches and synagogues and emptied the St. Peter's Square of Christian worshippers, other religious centers also restricted their services and reduced the number of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and monasteries.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the suspension of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and subsequently the suspension of pilgrimages, while Saudi Arabia also banned the arrival of foreign pilgrims and banned the movement of its own citizens to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the longest postponement of the Games in the post-World War II era.
Several major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak of the disease has hampered the planning of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to take place at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced that the Games would be held at a later date but not postponed from the summer of 2021.Casinos and other venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been either postponed or cancelled.
This has led to more gamblers becoming addicted to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting an increase in the number of new players joining their sites. Gaming and entertainment have also been affected, and several music groups have postponed or cancelled their concerts.
Many of the major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have suspended their shows.
Some artists have found alternative ways to share their performances and works online, such as live online concerts and events through websites so that artists can promote their performances and works to the public.
Online, numerous Internet memes on the coronavirus topic have been circulated in the form of satire and entertainment to the public out of dissatisfaction.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been a focus on deep-rooted prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent and against people of ethnicity in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Panic, hostility and hatred have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were reported in China) showed that many people around the world feel intense ethnic hatred and that Chinese people are responsible for the virus and that what happens to them is a punishment for their actions.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also been observed in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
There is support for both online and offline support for Chinese and for areas where the virus is present.
In view of the development of the outbreak in some new countries, the Italian public may also face fear and suspicion, the country being the first European country to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak.People from Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have made efforts to contain the disease and have called for a ban on Chinese people entering their countries.
In Japan, a hashtag #China-the-Japan-to-no-war was created on Twitter.
Chinese people in the UK and the US and people from other Asian countries reported higher levels of racial discrimination and harassment.
US President Donald Trump has faced backlash for his remarks that referred to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus, which critics have described as discriminatory and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Indian students reported their harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak as they travelled from the northeastern regions of India that border China to the big cities for classes.
The Bharatiya Janta Party state premier in West Bengal Dillip said that the Chinese destroyed nature so God took revenge on them.
The speech was later condemned by the Chinese Consul in Calcutta, who called it a mistake.In China, the ill-treatment and discrimination of non-Chinese citizens has intensified due to the pandemic, with Chinese people referring to foreigners as foreigners and wanting to leave China.
Many newspapers have removed them from some or all of their covers.
Many academic publications have published scientific papers on the epidemic that anyone can access.
Some scholars have wanted to share their results via servers that are already running such as bioRxiv.

There are methods in experimental laboratories for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease 19-COVID and 2-SARS-CoV viruses that detect the presence of the virus and demonstrate the presence of antibody production against the virus.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
In March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus's main protease was identified as a target for post-infection therapy.
It is used to diagnose the most recent and active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and care of people.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, both those with very few symptoms and those with symptoms.
The exact mortality rate for malaria and the level of public safety can be determined by the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had accurate data on the spread of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, with most countries having a policy of not testing those with fewer symptoms, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
This diversity also influences the reported case fatality rate, which may be estimated to be higher in some countries.
The test uses real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
The RT-PCR test performed on column samples is valid only in the first week of infection.
The virus can then escape from the intestines and enter the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week, alternative samples are taken from their deep respiratory tract using a breathing bag or a coughing substance (sputum).
One of the first PCR tests was performed in January 2020 at the Charité in Berlin using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and provided the basis for the distribution of 250,000 thermal thermometers to the World Health Organization.
The UK also conducted a test on 23 January 2020.On 28 January 2020, a company called KoginiBioch in South Korea developed a yearly scale device to detect temperature based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2.
It detects the E genes released by the beta-CoV virus and specifically SARS-CoV-2.BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to obtain a license from the National Health Products Administration of China to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 thermometric instrument.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR accurate timing reagent (RT-PCR) to its public health laboratories through international referral resources.
One in three genetic tests of adult test kits produced improper results due to faulty performance and led to a testing bottleneck at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to only 100 samples per day being successfully processed for the entire month of February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, the tests performed on two apples were not considered satisfactory, and these tests were not accepted to allow testing by state and local laboratories.
The tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration through an emergency use authorization.The US commercial laboratories began their own tests in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests are available nationwide using RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostic also provided access to COVID-19 tests nationwide on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced, and the collection and processing of samples must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
COVID-19 tests in Russia were developed and implemented by the State Research Center for Virus Identification and Vector Biotechnology.
The test was registered by the Federal Health Care Services on February 11, 2020.On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic announced the test for COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in half-hour intervals at high volume, allowing a single machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Abbott m2000 assay to Abbott Laboratories; similar approvals were also granted by the FDA to certain laboratories, including Halogic, LeapCorp, and Armour Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cefed also received an emergency use license from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA approves tests that use thermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
This method can detect positive results in as little as 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes as there is no need for a series of alternating heat cycles in this method.
About 18,000 of these machines are now available in the United States and Abbott wants to accelerate production to 50,000 tests per day.A method of testing using a single antibody to bind to the nucleoscopic protein (N protein) of the coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that this method will allow the test to take 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the rapid test for influenza.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "a chest radiograph has little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] findings may be available even before symptomatization".
Bi-dimensional glass is produced from the environment, and contrasting and lateral dispersion is common in rapidly developing diseases.
Subplural dominance and creep (the narrowing of the pleural membrane with the varied filling of the alveolar orifice), and co-occlusion may occur as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its responses were overlapped with other pneumonia and pathology processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for first-line testing or screening to diagnose COVID-19".As of March 2020, WHO recommended the following case definitions:
Part of the immune response against a microbe is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These are used to monitor people, assess the immune system, and diagnose disease in people who have had symptoms in the first 7 days or so.The tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or by a point of care test (PoCT).
In most clinical laboratories highly automated systems will have the capability to perform the tests but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
A peripheral blood sample is commonly used for CLT, although continuous samples are used for the immune system response.
For PoCT, a blood sample is typically taken by skin piercing.
Unlike the PCR method, a pre-test-to-discharge phase is not required.On 26 March 2020, the FDA named nine companies that had notified the agency as required and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA through an emergency use license.In late March 2020, Euromonth Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and Epiglot Diagnostic Laboratories received European approval for their test alveolar, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test has a capacity of several hundred samples per hour and is therefore much faster than the PCR test for viral RNA.
Generally, antibodies are detectable 14 days after the disease has appeared.In early April, the UK found that none of their purchased diagnostic tools were useful.
Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they will inspect it, send it back and will receive the test result shortly after.The British NHS has announced that it is developing a scheme for testing suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient coming to the hospital or if an ambulance is discharged.For suspected cases, testing for COVID-19 via a drive-through, using the appropriate precaution, by a healthcare professional, is required.
Car-in-car diagnostic centers have helped South Korea to test more quickly and widely than other countries.In Germany, the National Union of Physicists of Legal Health Insurance said on March 2 that it has a capacity of about 12,000 tests through satellite diagnostics and that 10.700 tests had been taken in the past week.
When the dose is requested by a doctor, the costs are covered by the health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, the head of the institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, testing has been proposed in several major cities.
The total number of tests performed as of 26 March 2020 was unknown as only positive case numbers were being reported.
The preliminary survey of laboratories showed that as of week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been carried out, including 33,491 cases (6.9%) of samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same week.In the study, researchers at the Tekin and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients at a time, by combining multiple samples, and further testing in the event of a positive case in the combined samples.On February 5, 2020, BGI will conduct a large-scale test in Wuhan on a 2,000 square meter area of Wuhan (China) called the Wuhan Eye or Eye Disease Day, which involves testing more than 10,000 samples in a single facility.
By monitoring the build and taking 5 days to build by BGI founder Wang Jin, modeling shows that cases in Hubei had risen 47% and the associated cost of resolving the quarantine would have doubled had this testing capacity not been raised at the same time.
The Wuhan lab was immediately followed by the Huayan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in all 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, the capacity of the tests was 50,000 tests in a day.Open source, designs contributed by Origami Assess have been released that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests.This parallel design can be done in small laboratories without the need for a mechanical fluid extractor.
By March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of the agent had made mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States problematic.
The authors were forced to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more of its population per capita for coronavirus than any other country, and some have gone so far as to test more of their population.
This was through a combination of patient-site qualification, and the purchase of a population-level mass screening laboratory from 42 and BGI Group (based on the Hu-Yun Emergency Detection Laboratories in China).
The laboratory, which was set up in 14 days, has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world to perform such a scale of testing outside of China.
The genetic profile of the coronavirus by identifying different components and carrying out different testing procedures was developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO has sent the German approach to countries with low incomes and no resources to produce kits themselves.
The German protocol was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not established until 28 January, which suspended the tests available in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the validity of the test kits at the beginning of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough of these kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts to conduct the tests.
Conversely, experts say that South Korea's extensive testing facilities have helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The capacity for large-scale testing in private sector laboratories was built up over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for testing programs to be accelerated as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has led to the stockpiling of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemicals has been strained.
In March 2020, China reported an accuracy problem in their test kits.
In the United States, CDC-developed test kits had "half-failures" after which the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private labs from performing the tests.The Spanish purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Biovase Biotechnology, but later found the results to be incorrect.
The company responded that the incorrect results could be due to a problem with the collection of samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would return the kits that had negative results, and instead obtain different test kits from Shenzhen Biovaz.The Czech Republic, which purchased test kits from China, returned 80% of the kits with false results.Silvia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which later tested negative.
Prime Minister Mathies suggested that it should be changed to Danube.Atish Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that there was a "high level of error" in the test kits purchased by Turkey from China and "they were not used".The UK had purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the purchased kits were not usable.
Tests that tested positive, patients quarantined and those who had contact with people with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were followed up, with positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two tests of the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected patients were quarantined.
With limited access to the community, the new disease has been completely eradicated.
With the advent of contact tracing, restrictions on inbound travel, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore is progressing much more slowly than in other developed countries, and there are no severe restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail stores.
Many ceremonies were cancelled, and Singapore advised people to stay indoors until 28 March, but schools reopened on time following the holiday on 23 March.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the outbreak through random contact tracing, restrictions on inbound travel, screening, and quarantine, but with low levels of lockdown.
One statistical study found that, relative to the number of deaths, the mortality rate is much lower in countries that have carried out more testing, possibly because these countries are better able to identify people with little or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to the 16 WHO reference laboratories for testing validation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "Testing as positive as %" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people who go to the hospital has a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests the entire population, whether people have symptoms or not, but other things being equal.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, debris, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Constant handwashing with soap at "important moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g., diarrhoea and gonorrhea, which are transmitted from hands to mouth by contact with dirt.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five critical times of day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food and after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can also be washed with air.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in the following situations:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after patient care.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who have had a bowel movement.
After blowing a nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, pet food, or pet waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene habits related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of infection.
The main health purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone.
Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory illness;
and reducing the rate of infant mortality during home birth.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing habits may lead to minor improvements in height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action could reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by almost a third, and this is linked to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea incidents could be attributed to hand washing with soap.Hand washing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive method to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), if done automatically in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the major component of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, taking the lives of approximately 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing a regular habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical treatment, and reduce by half the deaths from diarrhoea and by a quarter the deaths from respiratory infections.
Hand washing is often associated with other forms of hygiene as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against deadly germs that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
The only minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, scaly skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand-washing is also known as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important in reducing the transmission of infection from the body to the mouth: after using the toilet (to empty or relieve feces), after cleaning the bottom of the baby (to change the pumper), before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other situations where proper hand washing technique should be used to prevent transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, and sneezing; after handling animal waste or animal feces; and after touching litter.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap.A 2014 study showed that the rate was highest in Saudi Arabia at 97 percent; in the United States at nearly 77 percent; and lowest in China at 23 percent.Many methods of habit change are now available to promote the habit of washing hands with soap at key times.Group handwashing for school children at designated times of the day is an option in developing countries that is becoming more common in children.
The "Health Care Essentials Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a level action to promote children's health and educational growth.
Treating lice twice a year, as well as washing hands daily with soap, and brushing teeth daily with fluoride are the main goals of this national program.
The program is also being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is promoted by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the blockages in the solvent, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not effective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soils, are not easily soluble in water.
Proper water circulation only helps with cleaning.
Solid soaps, due to their reusable nature, may retain bacteria derived from earlier uses.
A small number of studies looking at the transmission of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps have concluded that such transmission is unlikely as the bacteria are cleansed by soap foam.
The CDC still says "the use of liquid soap to control cleaning is preferable to hand contact for use by many people".
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted among health-conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic or non-antibiotic use recommendations are optimal for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antimicrobial soaps do contain common antimicrobials such as triclosan, which has a broad list of resistant organism species.
So if antibiotic-resistant strains are not chosen for the antimicrobial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed to be.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protective agent, as a pH regulator, complex formulations such as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin conditions (alveolar, vitamin, menthol, plant extract) may contain acidic substances (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicates that simple soaps are as effective in preventing disease and removing bacteria from hands as consumer grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan.
The hot water that is suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, in removing natural oils that contain dirt and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing microbial stress on hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer without water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-free hand sanitizers, hand sanitizer antiseptics, or hand sanitizers) gained popularity.
Most depend on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed in a gel with a thick material such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymers), or a haemocontent such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam to make it easier to use and to reduce the drying effects of alcohol.
Disinfecting hydrogen peroxide concentrated liquid further enhances the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.
The sanitizer contains bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), strep, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungicides.
Hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a reduction of 3.5 logs, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) after 30 seconds of hand sanitizing and kill 99.99% of bacteria after 1 minute of hand sanitizing.Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against the Norovirus (or Norvac) strain of the virus that is the main cause of gastroenteritis.The hands should be sprayed with sufficient antiseptic or alcohol to allow both hands to wash well.
The sanitizer should be applied to the front and back of the hands and between and to the end of all fingers for about 30 seconds to dry the liquid, foam or gel.
The tops of the fingers should also be washed thoroughly, and rubbed into both hands.The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand-washing with hand sanitizer, especially when hands are very wet.
The increased use of these substances is due to their ease of use and quick killing activity against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless the formula is skin softening or moisturizing.
The skin-drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Contact allergies to dermatitis, urticaria syndrome, or severe allergies to alcohol or hand washing are less common in alcoholics.
A lower propensity for itchy irritation with dermatitis has become noticeably more common than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless products do not remove organic matter from hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, because pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and composition, and historically has been less commonly used than alcohol and hand sanitizers.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown persistent and highly active antimicrobial activity after use, as opposed to alcohol, and reduced efficacy after repeated use, possibly due to persistent adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use irons or soap cans instead.
Soils or soil may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or soil is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, talcum powder is an antiseptic because it combines with water to make an alkaline solution.
The World Health Organization has recommended aerosol or salt as a soap alternative when soap is unavailable.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the United States Center for Disease Control to prevent transmission of disease has the following steps:
Wash hands with warm or running water.
Running water is recommended as standing water in a bowl may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not cause a difference.
Wash hands with a sufficient amount of soap and detergent, including the backs of the hands, the middle of the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more often when soap is used instead of water.
Keep it on for at least 20 seconds.
Hair creates a seal, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and hair for a long time removes more germs.
Wash it well under running water.
The bowl can be re-dried by washing hands in it.
Dry your hands with a clean towel or put them in an air dryer.
Wet and damp hands can be easily re-polluted. The most common hand contaminants are the big toe, the dead hand, the spaces between the fingers, and the undersides of the fingernails.
Artificial nails and polished nails may provide a basis for microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect hands from dryness; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of disease.
In developing countries, where tap water and/or soap are not available, several low-cost options can be developed to facilitate hand washing, for example, by pouring water from a suspended bucket or kettle that has a suitable soak and/or using an aerosol if necessary.In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are also water conservation solutions, such as "low-pump or suspended buckets", and other low-cost options.
Tippy-tap or tipped-tap is a simple technique where a hand is tied to a rope, and a footed tree is moved to tap water on the hands, with a small amount of soap on the hand.
Effectively rinsing hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective type of rinsing in public toilets.
Large scale research suggests that the paper towels found in most toilets are healthier than hand-drying electronic machines.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, funded by the paper industry as the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and other advanced jet air dryers.
After washing hands and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to be increased by an average of 194% on the fingertips and 254% on the palms.
Hand drying with a jet air dryer has led to an increase in the total number of bacteria on fingertips by an average of 42% and 15% on the hand.
After washing hands and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on fingertips and 77% on the toenails.Scientists also performed tests to determine whether any drying method resulted in contamination between other bathroom users and the bathroom environment.
The jet air blower, which allegedly blows air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of flushing microorganisms from hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 metres away.
Hot air hand dryers disperse microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the machine.
No specific prevalence of microorganisms has been observed in paper tissue.In 2005, various hand drying methods were evaluated in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and in the field of hand drying, hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
The use of hand sanitizer to wash hands is an alternative when traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory after a Hungarian physician named Ignaz Semmelweis found handwashing effective in preventing disease in a hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget to.
One study found that the rate of infection decreased with their use.
The medical hand washing method is for a minimum of 15 seconds, and sufficient soap and water or gel should be used to soak and all parts of the hands should be washed.
The hands should be washed by inserting the fingers of both hands into each other.
If there is a pimple under the fingernails, a brush should be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain on hands in water, it is important to wash hands thoroughly and dry them with a clean cloth.
After drying, paper towels should be used to block water (and if necessary, the exit door can be opened with paper).
This prevents the hands from being re-contaminated from those places.
Handwashing in a healthcare setting is intended to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in many medical environments the rate of hand-washing is at an unacceptable rate, with many doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before contacting patients, and thus transmitting microbes.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream diseases by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a leaflet that outlines standard practices for hand washing and hand hygiene in healthcare settings.
The organization's hand hygiene guideline design is also posted on its website for public comment.
This review was conducted by Whitby and his colleagues.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if needed to prove regulatory compliance.
According to the World Health Organization, the following "five conditions" must be met in order to wash hands:
After contact with blood/body fluids
before carrying out the disinfection work, and
After treating the patient. adding anti-infective chemicals to the soap ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) gives the hand-washing agent its killing power.
Such a microbiological killing action may be required before performing surgery or in medical facilities where the spread of antibiotic resistant organisms is most likely to occur. To sanitize one's hands for the purpose of surgery, it is necessary to have a tube available that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or washing iodine should also be available, along with sanitary towels to dry the hands after washing, a hairbrush for washing and a hygienic tool to clean the new part of the finger under the fingers.
All jewelry should be removed.
The method requires that the hands be washed for 2-6 minutes.
Hand washing for a long time (10 minutes) is not recommended.
Avoid throwing water on the hands from the sides when pouring water.
After the hand washing is complete, the hands should be dried with a hygienic cloth, and the surgical garment should be rinsed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizers before and after treating a sick person.
In hospitals for the control of staphylococcal disease, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing came from the first 20% of hand washing and little to no additional benefit was obtained when the frequency of hand washing exceeded 35%.
Washing hands with simple soap causes three times more transmission of bacterial infections to food than washing with antimicrobial soap.Popping an alcohol-containing solution on hands for an average of 30 seconds and comparing hand washing with antimicrobial soap showed that alcohol-containing hand washing reduced microbial contamination by 26% more than antimicrobial soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand washes at reducing the spread of H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile from hands.Health care facilities can improve hand hygiene by educating staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand washes, and providing written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which approaches are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and essential means to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made it challenging to make hand washing a universal practice.
For example, hand washing faucets near private or public toilets are very rare in many rural areas of Africa, while cheaper options for hand washing spaces are available.
However, a lower rate of hand washing may be the result of a poorly formed habit than the absence of soap or water.
Promoting and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a change in people's long-standing habits.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary for this to be effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing habits in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and affordable steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can move from one star to three stars.
The establishment of hand washing facilities can be part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce the rates of disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness raising campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of habit change.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis.
Several studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing associated with the prevention of DALYs in developing countries.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is much cheaper than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth in hospitals or injured servicemen - was first recognised in the mid-19th century by two of the leading doctors of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Agnes Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale who was English and "the founder of modern nursing".
Many people at the time believed that the infections were caused by a bad smell called mustard.
In the 1980s, the foodborne illness and healthcare-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters entitled "The right handwashing techniques" have been placed near public toilets in Germany and handwashing in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing one's hands of a thing" means that one is dissatisfied with taking responsibility for it or participating in the crime.
The text originates from the Gospel of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to execute Jesus Christ but became a widely used phrase in English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of the dark stain, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she has committed and encouraging her husband to do the same.
It has also been found that people, after recalling or contemplating immoral acts, are driven to wash their hands more often than at other times, and place more value on handwashing equipment.
Additionally, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such thinking are less likely to engage in other compulsory "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. using water to wash hands without soap, is a part of the ritual of hand washing in many religions such as the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tulu and Nitlat Yadrem in Judaism, Lāva in Christianity, and Oudh in Islam. Religions also specifically recommend healthy hand washing after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam mandate hand-washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing before and after meals.
Measures to control the risk of COVID-19 in the workplace
COVID-19 risk control measures in the workplace include the use of occupational safety and health measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The risk control measures considered in the workplace depend on the workplace and the job, including the risk assessment of the source of infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for each worker who may be exposed to COVID-19.
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers low-risk occupations to have low contact with people and other workers, and recommends that early prevention measures be taken.The early prevention measures include hand washing, telling workers to stay home if they become ill, taking precautions to prevent respiratory transmission, and sanitizing and disinfecting the work environment on a daily basis.
The occupations with a moderate risk of infection are those that require sustained and close contact with strangers and people suspected of having COVID-19, but may become ill due to ongoing social transmission and international travel.
These work environments include workers who have contact with people, such as schools, crowded work environments, and crowded retail locations.
In addition to the initial prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include effective air filtration, a plastic or glass screen to prevent contamination, personal protective equipment or devices because they may have come into contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers that healthcare and funeral workers who work with people who have or are suspected to have COVID-19 are at high risk of infection.If workers implement procedures to prevent the production of particles in the air from people who have or are suspected to have COVID-19 and collect or use samples from them for testing, the patient is at high risk of infection.
Risk control measures appropriate for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and appropriate personal safety equipment.
The spread of COVID-19 can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to protect others, or fear of contracting the disease.
Business practices may change. These practices may change both by the demand for the goods and by the means by which these goods are obtained (e.g., shopping at a low bar, or delivering to the customer on their own or providing quick service by car/motorcycle).
Finally, the transportation of goods from geographical areas that have been severely affected by COVID-19 may be cut off.The preparedness and response plan against the outbreak may be used to guide safe measures.
The plans cover the risk levels associated with various workplaces and occupations, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from home, and risk factors in social settings and for older workers and those with chronic health conditions.
Also, the plans outline the control measures to address the risks and provide plans for the potential situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Prevention and response plans for communicable diseases may require national and local recommendations.
The response to an outbreak of a pandemic aims to reduce the rate of transmission among employees, save people at risk of more serious health conditions, maintain work activities, and reduce side effects on other entities in the supply chain of activities.
The severity of the disease in the community where business is conducted affects the responses that take place.
The hierarchy of risk control measures is the framework, widely used to classify risk control measures during effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
In places where it is not possible to eliminate COVID-19 risks, the most effective control measures are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls, without reliance on worker oversight, are to discourage workers from work-related hazards, and are perhaps the most cost-effective way of doing this.
Administrative controls are changes in labor policies or procedures that require action by the employer or manager.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can sometimes help prevent disease.
All types of personal safety equipment must be selected based on the risk to the worker, installed properly (e.g., respirators), used continuously and properly, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says that the lowest risk of infection is low workplace contact with people and coworkers.
The basic measures to prevent the spread of disease, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and complete hand washing, staying at home if workers are sick, measures to prevent the transmission of disease through the respiratory system including covering coughs and coughs, preparing paper towels and washing up used items, being prepared to take telephone calls or change shifts if necessary, preventing workers from using other tools and equipment, and cleaning and disinfecting the work environment on a daily basis.
Early identification and isolation of possible infections is the most important step in ensuring the safety of workers, customers, observers, and others in the workplace.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until their fever has subsided with the use of fever-reducing or symptomatic medications for at least 24 hours, fever symptoms have subsided, and other symptoms have subsided.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a moderate risk of infection include workers who are in contact with people who are not infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 at a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 from community transmission in the workplace, or who may be infected with the disease from a recent international trip to a location where COVID-19 has been widely spread.
These include workers who are in contact with the public at large, such as those who work in schools, high-risk public workshops, or retail stores or places where there are high numbers of customers.These include the use of hand sanitizers and hygiene products and the use of protective clothing and eyewear in schools and workplaces with high numbers of customers.We provide engineering controls for these and high-risk groups, installing air-conditioning filters, increasing the number of ventilators, providing a level of physical protection from physical contaminants such as light-emitting plastic screens, providing a high-level hand sanitization service through the use of a car/motorcycle.The restrictions on the use of these high-risk public workshops include restrictions on the use of hand sanitizing equipment and training on the use of personal protective equipment that is mandatory for COVID-19 and the use of vaccines, the use of personal protective equipment to prevent illness, the use of COVID-19 by persons at risk, the development of a workplace safety plan for those who need to travel to work, the creation of a workplace with a limited knowledge base or a plan to prevent illness, the introduction of new vaccines, the use of vaccines, the development of vaccines, and other workplace safety measures necessary to prevent illness.
Workers in this risk group require very low levels of ventilation.
If someone is sick on board, appropriate controls for the safety of the crew and other passengers include isolating other passengers and crew by maintaining a 6 foot distance from others, recommending that the sick person wear a mask, and asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing.
The passenger in the cabin concerned should use disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching liquids or possibly contaminated surfaces, and if possible use other personal protective equipment in case the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Immediate and disposable items should be packed in red/hazardous packaging, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. Risk controls on commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, include suspending the voyage if a person is sick, and isolating the traveller if they have fever or other symptoms of illness and immediately notifying the medical personnel on board.
In principle, medical surveillance should be carried out in the quarantined person's cabin.For schools and childcare centers, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may recommend a temporary school vacation for cleaning and disinfection in the event that a sick person has come to school regardless of community transmission of the disease.
Where there is a low chance of social transmission, social distancing strategies should be implemented, such as canceling field trips, meetings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or church meetings or cafeteria receptions, increasing the distance between tables, changing arrival and departure times, limiting emergency attendance, and using separate health office space for children with symptoms such as influenza.
When transmission in the local community continues to be strong, social distancing strategies may be considered in addition to extended school holidays.For law enforcement personnel, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the level of emergency health risk to be low for those who perform routine activities and affairs.
Law enforcement authorities who may have to contact persons suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the relevant guidelines for personal safety, including appropriate equipment, such as emergency medical personnel.
Where close contact is possible during detention, staff should clean and disinfect their belts and military clothing with homemade disinfectant sprays before second use, and follow standard operating procedures for the storage and disposal of used personal protective equipment and for the protection and laundering of clothing.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) estimates that healthcare and funeral workers are exposed to high and very high rates of infection.
The highest-risk occupations include healthcare and medical personnel, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to COVID-19 infection and suspected cases.
Where workers apply procedures to prevent the production of airborne particulates and collect or use samples for testing of infected and suspected COVID-19 patients, the risk of infection is increased.
Procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles include intubation, a cough syringe, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and examinations, and most frequently, the collection of specimens.
High-risk funerals include workers engaged in preparing the bodies of people who are dying with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.If these workers perform autopsies, their infection rate is significantly increased.Additional engineering controls for this risk group include the isolation of the bones for COVID-19 infected and suspected patients as well as procedures to prevent the production of particles present in the air.
A special negative pressure ventilator may be appropriate in some health and funeral facilities.
Sampling should be carried out taking into account the precautionary measures of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be kept in a separate waiting room depending on the suspected case of COVID-19.In addition to other personal safety equipment, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends respirators for personnel working within 6 feet of infected or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients and personnel performing airborne particulate control procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 face masks or better should be used in an extensive and written respiratory protection program that includes appropriate training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may be used for better safety and to provide convenience to the worker.The World Health Organization does not recommend masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease.The disease is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only medical masks for screening personnel at the gate.
The WHO recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses, face masks, medical clothing and gloves for those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, care for them or transport them from one place to another without performing procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air.
If a procedure to prevent the production of particulate matter in air is performed, N95 or FFP2 respirators may be used instead of surgical masks.
Given the inadequate global availability of personal protective equipment, WHO recommends the removal of the need for remote healthcare and physical barriers, such as clean windows, the reduction of the need for personal protective equipment, allowing the use of personal protective equipment only for those directly caring for COVID-19 patients, the use of personal protective equipment without removing a respirator during care for a patient, the monitoring and elimination of personal protective equipment/exposure, and the recommendation not to use masks for outdoor occupations.

Subject: [COVID-19] Taking the burden and preparing for the future
Posted on 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we find ourselves in a remarkable situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the things that has clarified our global human relationships and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
We have no experience of these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on a kind of global solidarity, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The collaboration and care we have between our colleagues through emails, calls, and online conversations is a remarkable validation and trust of the wonderful people we are fortunate to work with.
I cannot thank you enough and I am proud to have you as my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me the gratitude of our work.
They reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia, and how powerful a symbol it is as a valuable resource that is online and accessible to all.
It's your job to make sure that you keep this website open, that you get paid for it by your colleagues, and that you keep the community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides more than ever.
It's the moment when not only what we do or how we do it, but what we do and how we do it can have the most meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this message and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.
Adapt to your work and schedule
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our strategy and schedule for the coming days and months.
In these conversations, we consider what we think would be the appropriate response to what we are facing and the best way to maintain the stability and integrity of the organization in the meantime.
We wanted to reduce the pressure and support our mission in the long term.
If you want to dial it again, no problem.
For all employees, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectation is 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't have any holidays - if you can work more than normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, the world is very unpredictable these days, and your wellbeing is our priority, whether you're taking care of a loved one, shopping for a house or visiting a doctor.
We don't watch your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should be done without saying, but we'll tell you anyway.
No sick leave or PTO required  Just tell your manager and help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that key parts of the job are covered.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian T&C Ops know so T&C can assist you and ensure your situation is properly managed.)
Hourly workers are paid in full.
We have said before and we will say again that we will honor our commitments to our contractors and our hourly workers.
Each will be paid based on their normal hours under normal circumstances.
If you are sick and unable to work, this is also included.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a way to spin their stress around the world around them.
What we're doing is incredibly rewarding, especially at a time like this.
Again, this means your own attention.
The key is to talk to your manager, so you know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered important.
There are some things we have to do.
The teams at SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Capital Raising (among others) are doing important work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all agencies to assess current objectives and focus on supporting what is important to our mission.
There are so many agencies that do things for us, we all need to focus on the most important projects.
For now, dry walks are painless.
We do not plan to "double the time to prepare" once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to do this extra work to meet the deadline, as it is now fictitious and unrealistic.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and we must work to set new goals and timelines.
What happens to the annual planning?
To align with our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timetable for the presentation of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which creates more time to budget and allows staff to prioritize critical work, self-care, compassionate care, while accommodating those who want to work on a reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
The extension of scheduling greatly reduces the current workload and stress of planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update delegates and teams on new actions as they are approved.
Thanks to the leadership of the APP team.
Office status, exposure to disease, and cleanliness
Last week, we received news that our SF-related staff may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, by taking a series of precautionary measures, we hired a virus-proofing team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiseptic solution to disinfect every surface as well as lobby and elevator shaft that reaches our floor.
The building employs a maintenance duty protocol and uses materials that help to ensure the safety of tenants.
We feel reassured that the office will be properly prepared upon your return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and the DC staff.
Since last week, our DC office has been moved to a completely remote location in accordance with a shared direction with San Francisco.
As our correspondents in New York City know, we are in the middle of discussing the rental of a space in Brooklyn.
The talks are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working in remote areas for the first time.
Our long-time remote partners know that this can be a discipline and discipline, and would like to offer you some tips:
Limit the length of the sessions to one or two hours.
If longer meetings are required, consider how the meeting can be broken up over several days.
Make the purpose of the meeting clear, include an agenda, and send reading material before the meeting.
Share videos on Google Docs and Zoom tools to create live help and collaboration and contact.
Designate a leader for each meeting, someone to monitor the talks on questions and follow up the speaker list and someone to help take notes (or jointly take notes).
If you need a quiet microphone or headset, send an email to tech support.
Use your well-being payment for breakfast.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The Human Resources Activities team reviews webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the deployment of distributed workloads throughout the foundation.
Last week, we asked community contractors to cancel public programs funded by Wikimedia, such as EditorialTunes, until the pandemic is declared over by the World Health Organization.
They informed us that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible for us to perform their contractual activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or changing the purpose of these activities.
We will start monitoring other guidelines for Wikimania and other regional and community-themed conferences next week.
The global community in general seems to be feeling frustrated with the turmoil, but relaxed in their attitude and ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
Moving forward, CRT is working on creating a page on MetaWiki to create a space for the community to monitor the impact and track our interactions with them.
Dealing with COVID-19 related topics
We will send you a notice of a special working meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional information, answer your questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We are in this together and can help each other in this way.
In addition, you can continue to find information at this email address and other important COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working on maintaining ongoing contacts with staff who are currently living in the most affected countries.
If you have questions about such trips, programs, major work processes, coverage-related challenges, or anything else that you need help with, you can contact or work with CRT without any hesitation.
We want to provide help and make connections when needed.
If you have sensitive or confidential information, please email it to Brian Jordan, Global Head of Human Resources Operations.
No change should be seen as leaving work and responsibilities behind.
Rather, it is a recognition that at a certain point our work and responsibilities must be organized in a way that was not previously organized.
These are steps that we believe are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue our work, manage our work with the help they need, and manage the world with the service they can trust.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that may be coming in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need you to achieve this goal, and we ask that you protect yourself and your family, so that you are prepared and ready when the need arises.
Now please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda, Amy Way, Brian Jay, Doreen Day, Gregory Way, Jim Way, Joel L., Lynne L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and other members of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jim Way, Janine Y., Lisa S., Robin A., Ryan M., and Toby Ann).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing the Ang (α1-7) levels, thus becoming a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc, which is a metalloenzyme and resides on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an M2 domain of N-terminal peptides and a C-terminal clinaryl-renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, which has an enzymatic active domain, and is expressed on the surface of cells in the lung and other tissues.
The ACE2 external domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shadas, and the final soluble protein is dispersed in the bloodstream and ultimately excreted via urine or feces.
ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is associated with the type II allovcular cells of the lungs, the enterocytes of the small intestine, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, and the vascular cells of the arteries in most organs.
The ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
The ACE receptor secretes angiotensin II into the hormone angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, isolates the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and converts it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9] - bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dienorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane that is the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in Hartnapp disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 S1 spike proteins to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface causes endocytosis and transmission for both viruses and enzymes that reside in the cells.
This entry process also requires the provision of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic.This has led some to speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight disease.
However, several professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those who had had a stroke and heart disease".
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-associated mortality, although the effects were less pronounced than the overall risk of pneumonia".
The human synthesis of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulse hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) for 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are intolerant of classic renin-angiotensin systemic inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients where angiotensin II is elevated. Injection of rhACE2 for treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions and jurisdictions, various apps have been developed or offered with official support from governments.
Many frameworks have been developed to build a relationship tracking app.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems that are built based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
A few less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to let the user access other mobile phones as they get closer.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would jointly support these Bluetooth-based apps to work directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have been infected with COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 cities in China.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app, developed by the local IT community, will be released as open source and submitted to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "StopKorona!" that identifies contacts of potential patients and provides rapid response to health services officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said the contact tracing app was in the final stages of development, and would be available in a few weeks.A similar app is also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems in application-based systems, including false positive results and potential lack of effectiveness if application use is limited to a small fraction of the population.
In light of concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set restrictions on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to the Apple Store, limiting them to only "official" or, in other words, reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The above organizations announced eight conditions regarding government projects:
The surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The extension of surveillance and surveillance should have a terminating clause;
The use of data will be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Information security and confidentiality must be protected and evidence-based;
Digital surveillance should prevent discrimination and marginalization;
Sharing information with a third party should be defined in law;
Protections against abuse and protections on citizens' rights must be in place to respond to abuse;
Meaningful participation by all "priority stakeholders" is needed, including public health experts and marginalized groups.The Computer Club Against Corruption (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) of the Netherlands also published checklists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to solve the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems when no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted network-based location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps and prevents tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been adopted.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all centralized systems require having central servers to access personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been built that use central servers only for internal communication (see section below).
In South Korea, the app-free system was used to conduct contact tracing.
Rather than using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from multiple sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined it to inform individuals with potential illnesses via SMS.
In addition to using this information to inform potential contacts, the government has allowed public access to location information, which has been allowed due to sweeping changes to data privacy laws in the country following the outbreak of MERS.
People access this information through a number of apps and websites.Other countries, including Germany, use centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, no details have been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracing is an emerging well-established idea, with much of this research dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, dozens of expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to insert a user into other mobile phones by proximity.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and does not have a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity privacy protection tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact incident number, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols and mobile contact tracing mechanisms (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons are made on the device.
The Privacy Group is developing SafePaths at the MIT Media Lab, a platform for the use of privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or pathway intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is a platform based on research published in the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Protecting Privacy in a Pandemic" in March 2020. A similar effort is the creation of the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies and was originally developed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses hardware-safe technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without having to compromise on the privacy of this information.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was formed by a number of groups that brought together a number of similar protocols and extensive protocols aimed at facilitating international collaboration in the area of analytics, tracking and notification applications, a key aspect of achieving the goal of widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had released the BlueTrace protocol as open source to be used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claim will protect privacy and will be based on a combination of Bluetooth low-power technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three phases:
Launching tools so governments can create official privacy-protecting coronavirus tracking apps
Integrating this functionality directly into the iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to resolve the problem of monitoring start and end by first distributing the system through an operating system update and later by removing the data when the threat ends in the same manner.
Drug re-designation (also known as reusing a drug for another purpose, re-profiling, re-purposing or re-treatment) refers to the re-use of an approved drug to treat another disease or medical condition instead of the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is a line of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma delivery to the canal.SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-modifying proteins each with multiple ligand binding points.
Analysis of these binding sites suggests a suitable project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the pappin-type protease, RNA-related RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain and colleagues studied a number of selectable compounds, which they then optimized and analyzed to find skeletal similarity to the most commonly accepted drugs, to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in a preclinical study and recommend them to the clinical research design.

Major research is underway at Duke and Oxford Universities.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed and demonstrated that favipiravir is a "clearly effective" drug.
The average duration of the negative test was 4 days in 35 patients in Shenzhen who received the drug, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half were given imifevir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the available evidence for the drug is limited and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that they would purchase medicines from Japan for stockpiling, and use the army to deliver the medicines to university hospitals, where they would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made suggestions to the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of disease in places where the virus has already spread several times.
Use of the drug may not be safe for pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Calitra), which is a combination of the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no benefit".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from recurring by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find compounds that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.Criticism exists in the scientific community for those who direct resources towards developing approved drugs for other diseases, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization also included lupinavir/ritonavir in the Global Integration trial.
Remdesivir was developed and manufactured by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple flu, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and coronavirus.
An issue with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may overcome the high genetic barrier to resistance.Several clinical trials are underway, two of which are being conducted by the University Hospitals of Cleveland; one is being conducted in people with moderate disease and the other in people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are underway in people hospitalized with severe COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada), and one uncontrolled (Italy).

Some of the antibiotics that have been identified as potential reusable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are:
Tocilizumab (an IL-6 antagonist): approved by China.
Also tested in Italy and China. see Tocilizumab#COVID-19
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019.
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, there are many efforts underway to develop such a vaccine.
In February 2020, the World Health Organization said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the related or causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Worldwide, the epidemic peaked in 2020, resulting in significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using the released genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As revealed in April, the CEPI's innovation requirements for developing a vaccine include speed, manufacturing capacity, provision of a certain amount of data, and global access.
In April, scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The major objectives of the platform that advanced in the Phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer of phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (first phase developer and vaccine candidate: Cancinobiologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 39 more announced but with little publicly available information (believed to be under planning or in development).
Phase I-II trials, which are the first to test for safety and immunogenicity, are generally randomised, placebo-controlled, and multi-site, while also being the most accurate and effective dose-setting.
Phase III trials typically have a high number of participants.These participants include a control group, testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse events at the recommended dose/drug.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development phase approved since early April 2020, 74 have not been tested in human trials (still in pre-clinical trial phases).
On or around 24 April 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that the university was investigating a possible vaccine for a molecule-capture that genetically alters viral proteins to induce an immune response.

In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian company, announced that they would receive the results of pre-clinical trials in April 2020 and that the next-selected vaccine would begin human trials in autumn/fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Five for Pandemic Preparedness in France announced $4.9 million in funding for the COVID-19 vaccine research alliance, which includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of St. Petersburg, bringing the total funding for the CIPI to $29 million.
Other CEPI funding partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Kevork, Enovavi, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different selectable vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The selected vaccine was developed with the arrival of the strain from China in 14 days.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including a number of selected vaccines, at Canadian companies and universities, including the University of Saskatchewan's initiatives at MedicoGo and the University of Saskatchewan.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million grant specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, including plans to create a "vaccine bank" of various new vaccines to be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of St. Petersburg Medical School reported on the testing of Petkovak, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice.The report stated that, "MNAS delivered second-stage SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines that induced antigen-specific antibody-boosting responses [in mice] that appeared within 2 weeks of immunization".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced a DNA-selective vaccine design as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA can be engineered to replace bacteria inside the human body to produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities joined forces to acquire supercomputers from IBM, including cloud computing resources from Hewlett-Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as adverse effects/side effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond disease prevention.
In Australia, the Lunar Project seeks to recruit 4170 health workers for randomized trials.
The vaccine in development may not be safe or effective.
Preliminary studies to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines using animal models of COVID-19, such as ACA2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, require global coordination to ensure Level 3 biosafety measures and safety standard procedures to contain live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human or animal models.
As of 2020, no SARS vaccine has been developed to date that has been proven to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for all governments and public health agencies worldwide.There is also no proven vaccine against SARS.
When MERS was published, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a blueprint for the development of vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was only one DNA-based MERS vaccine that had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others are in development.All vaccines are viral vector vaccines, two others are the adenoviral-vector or ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and one is the MERS-MVA vaccine.
Social media posts have promoted conspiracy theories that claim the COVID-19 virus was unknown and that a vaccine was not available.
The patents filed, cited by numerous social media posts, have led to the discovery of other coronavirus variants, such as SARS coronaviruses, genetic sequences and vaccines.
B-coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the symptomatic coronavirus 2 of acute respiratory illness.
Typical symptoms include fever, cough, and chills.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, back pain, loss of sense of smell, nerve pain.
The time between infection and onset of symptoms is about five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases are benign, some cases include viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported from 210 countries and territories worldwide, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is initially spread through close contact between people, often through small droplets during coughing, sneezing, and talking.
While these droplets are produced during respiration, they usually fall on the floor or other surfaces, but are not long-distance contagious viruses.
People can also catch the virus by touching a dirt surface and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on various surfaces.
The virus is most contagious and contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although the virus can also be spread before symptoms appear or in the late stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by means of nasopharyngeal swabs/drops and a transcription polymerase chain reaction.
The use of a mask is recommended for those who are suspected to have the virus.
Recommendations for the use of masks vary among the public, with some authorities recommending against, some recommending against, and some recommending against.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in all six WHO regions, in most countries.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or may not have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and chills.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain and pressure, gangrene, difficulty waking, redness of the face and lips; seeking emergency medical attention should these symptoms or signs develop.
Unusually, symptoms of the upper respiratory system include fever, swollen nose, or back pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, coughing and diarrhea/nausea, were observed in varying percentages.
In the early Chinese, only chest tightness and heart palpitations were seen in some cases.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation phase.
The incubation phase of COVID-19 is typically six days but may vary between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people who become infected show symptoms, and it takes 11.5 days for symptoms to appear.Reports indicate that not all people who become infected show symptoms.
The role of these non-pathogenic vectors is not yet known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under investigation.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of all confirmed cases were left in hospital without symptoms.
China's National Health Commission also began to record daily cases of asymptomatic cases from April 1; 130 of 166 people infected with the virus tested asymptomatic on the same day, or 78%.
There was a high viral load in the lungs and lungs.
Talking in a higher pitch than normal conversation makes a person laugh more.
A study in Singapore found that a single uncapped tooth can transport a mouth drop of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that biovirus transmission is possible and air collection devices installed in corridors outside of people's homes have detected samples that have positive viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the respiratory secretions to aerosolize and subsequently spread the virus through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may have been transmitted through waste material, the level of confidence is low.The virus is most common when people have symptoms; while it is possible to spread before symptoms appear, the risk may be low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is unclear how easily the disease can spread, one person can infect two to three people in general. The virus can survive on surfaces for hours or days.
Specifically, the virus can survive for up to one day on paperboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and iron (I.S.I. 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, the survival of the virus on these surfaces depends on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are most effective when used correctly; the soap-related ingredients destroy the virus' double protective coating, inactivating it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are also less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, lung samples were taken on average two days after admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a higher viral load, and the sixth patient showed a higher viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory syndrome cases in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 novel virus are found in related coronaviruses in their own nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed in households by the use of soap, which breaks the virus's survival membrane.The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the original form of SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, as the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which accumulates in the cells of the lung's second type of pore.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to attach to the ACE2 enzyme and inject it into the corresponding cell.
Acute myocardial infarction was found in 12% of patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in acute illnesses.
The cardiovascular disease symptoms are higher during disease progression due to the systemic inflammatory response and disruption of the immune system, but the heart muscle injury may be related to the ACE2 enzyme receptor/receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed in the heart and carry out their function in the heart.
In the intensive care unit, patients with COVID-19 had high levels of blood clots (31%) and vascular clots (25%) that were probably caused by a lack of awareness of the disease.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a defense mechanism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory system, severely infected patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic high-level inflammation.
Specifically, the inflammation-producing GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and the development of severe lung damage or pathology in COVID-19-infected patients.
The presence of lymphocytic infiltrates has also been reported in cadaverization.
The World Health Organization published several testing protocols for the disease.
The transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of Arnhem's source is the standard test method.
Generally, the test is performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal tubing. However, nasal tubing or sputum samples may also be used.
Test results are available between a few hours and two days.
A blood test can be done, but this test requires two blood samples, with the second sample taken two weeks after the first sample and requiring much less time to obtain the results of each sample.
Chinese scientists were able to release a separate and genetic sequence of the coronavirus, allowing laboratories around the world to independently perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which detect active disease and whether a person has been infected before) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The accuracy of Chinese experiments tested by the examiner is only 60 to 70 percent.
The US FDA approved the first of the Care test for use later this month on 21 March 2020.Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital recommended methods for diagnosing diseases based on clinical symptoms and epidemiological risk.
Bi-dimensional glass is produced from the environment, and contrasting and lateral dispersion is common in rapidly developing diseases.
Subplural dominance and creep (the narrowing of the pleural membrane with the varied filling of the alveolar orifice), and co-occlusion may occur as the disease progresses.
Little data on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 is available.
The autopsy's key findings include:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary congestion and pulmonary oedema or fluid buildup in the airways and tissues of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia, depending on the severity:
Common pneumonia: pulmonary oedema or fluid buildup in the airways and tissues of the lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large unnumbered pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration in addition to interstitial/inflammatory inflammation and large nucleated cell formation.
Acute pneumonia: A disorder of the lung structure (DAD) accompanied by inflammatory inflammation in the lungs.
Dysfunctional appendicitis (DAD) is caused by symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Recovering pneumonia: Inflammatory secretion and development of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in the lungs.
Blood: large amount of blood clotting within the vein (DIC); leucotropic response
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of contracting the virus include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the mouth, eyes, and nose with unclean hands.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing and sneezing.
Also, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the use of face coverings in public places to reduce transmission from a symptomatic person to the infected.The goal of social distancing strategies, through closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings, is to reduce the rate of contact of many infected people with the virus.
The distance guidelines also state that people should stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no apparently effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Although a vaccine is not expected until 2021, the key part of preventing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the spread of the disease to its highest levels, known as "curve control".
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that people wash their hands for 20 seconds at a time, especially after using the toilet or when hands are wet or dirty, before eating and after cleaning the mouth, coughing, and sneezing.
The center also recommends the use of a 60% alcohol hand sanitizer/sanitizer, but only when soap and water are not readily available.In places where commercial hand sanitizer is not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two locally produced formulas.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used in alcohol to help prevent bacterial vaginosis.It is "not an active ingredient for the elimination of hand germs".
Glycerol is added as a diluent.
People are treated with supportive care, including fluid therapy, oxygenation, and support for other vital organs/tissues.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people suspected of having the virus wear a simple face mask.
External corporeal oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address respiratory dysfunction, but the benefits of this approach are still under discussion.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to strengthen the immune system.
Supportive care is useful for people with normal symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, mental health and pulmonary professionals have published treatment recommendations as a free resource from various agencies, including the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some health professionals recommend ibuprofen over prostaglandin (acetaminophen) as the first-time treatment for symptoms.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can produce airborne particles, such as injecting a tube or hand-ventilating a patient.
For healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends standard precautions, including contact precautions and airborne precautions, to place the patient in an airborne infection isolation isolation room (AIIR).The CDC provides guidance on the use of personal protective equipment during an epidemic.
Recommended items and devices include: personal protective equipment, respirators or face masks, eyeglasses/eye protection, medical gloves/handgloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has allowed the use of these masks in emergency situations based on an official EUA.
These masks are designed to protect against particles in the air such as dust and dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological virus is not guaranteed, unless used appropriately.
When masks are not available, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends using homemade face masks as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require a mechanical ventilator or alternative hand, but in some cases these are necessary.
Types of respiratory assistance for respiratory system dysfunction in COVID-19-associated patients are actively being investigated in hospitals.Some evidence suggests that the pipe inlet should not be used during inhalation or double-pass air positive pressure machine (BiPAP) use.
Whether these two approaches will work equally well for those who are critically ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to use mechanical ventilators through the mouth because this technique limits airborne particulate matter emissions more than breathing in a breathing tube. Severe accidents are more common in elderly people (over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the capacity of the health system to handle the sudden surge in the number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% required mechanical ventilator assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients have been hospitalized in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilators are becoming more complex as the symptoms of acute respiratory illness in COVID-19 increase and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control mode and PEEP capability should be able to deliver increased oxygen levels, while also reducing respiratory injury and pneumothorax risks associated with ventilation.
High-level PEEP may not be performed on older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and a number of antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be a very promising drug.
Although development of new drugs may continue until 2021, many of the investigational drugs are already approved for other uses or are already being tested in advanced stages.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in severely ill patients.
The World Health Organization is calling for volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has temporarily authorized the administration of recovered patient plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the patient's life is seriously and urgently threatened.
This experimental treatment has not been tested in clinical trials to show safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to help combat the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contacts" and potential risk of infection using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health authorities.The mobile data is used for large-scale data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile surveillance and artificial intelligence to monitor sick people who have come into contact with people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government asked security agencies to monitor mobile data of people who may have coronavirus.
This measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected people.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared mobile location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to investigate the virus and prevent its spread.
Russia has employed facial recognition technology to identify and locate quarantine breachers.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallaera, said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are walking around".
The German government granted 48 hours of vacation over the weekend to more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kirsty Kaljulaid called for five solutions to the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience depression from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or from the disease/virus.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Terrible social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline are all contributing to the immediate threat to people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may occur in the absence or presence of certain symptoms and in the presence of other common cold illnesses such as the common cold.
Normal cases generally recover in two weeks, while severe and severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from viruses similar to SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection, but there is no data on COVID-19. COVID-19 may affect the lungs of some infected people and cause asthma.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that results in respiratory failure, viral transmission and multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include viral transmission throughout the body, blood clotting abnormally, heart, kidney and liver damage.
Blood clotting, especially during elevated prothrombin time, was found in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of patients in this group.
An increase in liver transaminase enzyme levels was seen in approximately 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, plus five days in hospital.
Furthermore, people who were transferred to the ICU had an average time between hospitalization and death of seven days.
According to a study of early cases, the mean time from first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total of six to 41 days between the time of patients becoming ill and death.
According to a study by China's National Health Commission, the male mortality rate is 2.8%, while the female mortality rate is 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of the lung samples after death showed lesions of the tissues of both lungs, as well as inflammatory cytofibromycotic lesions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocythitis.
The lung imaging was similar to symptoms of acute respiratory illness.
Elevated troponin levels and cardiac arrhythmias were associated with 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
In the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing symptoms, according to March data.Access to medical resources and the socioeconomy of a region can affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from such a condition vary due to regional differences, but also due to methodological differences.
A low number of normal cases may lead to a higher than estimated mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths have occurred due to past infections means that current estimates of the number of deaths are lower than the reality.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to be severely infected with COVID-19 than non-smokers, and nearly 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU and die.
Hong Kong hospital officials noted a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity among those who had recovered from the disease and showed organ damage in the lung tissue.
This may be due to physical, mental, and emotional symptoms after the patient has been removed from the ICU following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether pre-exposure prophylaxis produces effective and long-lasting immunity in people who recover from the disease.
Depending on the behaviour of other strains of coronavirus, there may be a change in immunity, but cases of people recovering from COVID-19 after testing positive for coronavirus have been reported.
These cases are believed to be the cause of a persistent disease rather than a new virus worsening the situation.
The virus is believed to be a naturally occurring virus and originated from animals via a wide range of microbes.
The original source is unknown, but in December 2019 the virus began to spread almost exclusively from person to person.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date for the onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The most likely date of onset of symptoms in the official publications of the World Health Organization was 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to determine the death toll.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since onset of the disease, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization used the ICD-10 disease-free codes.The U07.1 code was used for deaths that were confirmed with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and the U07.2 code was used for deaths that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus.The death-to-case ratio of deaths is the number of cases diagnosed at a given time divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-survival rate is 6.9% as of 17 April 2020.
Figures vary by region. Other measures include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who have died from a disease, and the viral fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from a disease.
These statistics are not compiled on a time basis and track specific cases through case recovery.
While most infected people do not produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on why so many people become infected.
In the small village of Castigliano d'Asti, home to 4,600 people, in the centre of the outbreak in Italy, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Gangliath, the disease was spread by carnival festivals, and the younger population was exposed to a relatively low mortality rate, so the deaths of all those infected with COVID-19 could not be officially classified.
In addition, the German health system was not yet under pressure.
With the evaluation of blood donors, about 3% of the population in the Netherlands had antibodies.
69 confirmed cases (0.004% of the total population) have died from COVID-19.
The incidence and mortality rates of the disease differ between women and men.
The mortality rate is higher in men, according to studies in China and Italy.
For men, their life expectancy at risk is 50 years, with the gap between men and women closing only at age 90.
The mortality rate for men in China was 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
The main reason for this sex difference is not known, but genetic and physiological factors may be involved.
Gender-based immunological differences, such as lower prevalence in women than in men and more frequent occurrence of multiple diseases in men than in women, such as hypertension in adolescence, can lead to higher mortality.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government did not monitor gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS virus disease affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease should be "COVID-19".
The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that the name CO in the coronavirus, VI in the virus, D in the disease and 19 in the disease comes from the time when the disease first emerged and was recognized: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical area (such as China), animal, or group of people.The name was chosen in accordance with international guidelines intended to avoid confusion.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2, or SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the World Health Organization has used "COVID-19 virus" and "virus causing COVID-19" in its generic descriptions.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO's 2015 Guideline on Place Names for Diseases and Viruses provided the provisional names 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Syndrome for the virus and the disease.
The official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers make healthcare products and goods such as cotton swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when a hospital in Italy needed respirator masks, and the supply company could not provide them in a timely manner, a newly operating company made 100 masks in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were reported and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans can transmit and spread viruses to some animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of viral traces in rabbits, rats, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
Global research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched a "feasibility trial" to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral formulations in hopes of improving their effectiveness.
There is no available vaccine, but many agencies are actively working on developing a vaccine.
The work on SARS-CoV is anticipated to benefit from the fact that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccine development strategies are under investigation.
The first strategy is for researchers to develop a vaccine for the whole virus.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether inactivated or dead, is to stimulate the rapid immune response of the human body against the new COVID-19 virus.
The second strategy involves the development of sub-vaccines that aim to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system against the virus's sub-components.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focus on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for vaccine development).
Experimental vaccines from each of these strategies must be used for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a hereditary non-harmful code from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent amplification has been proposed as a possible challenge for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this has generated much debate.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, four of which were conducted with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of the Chinese trials involved other disease treatments, with nine reportedly underway in late April in Phase III trials of Remdesivir in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic clinical development trial for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs has been conducted.Many existing antiviral drugs are under evaluation and research for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/arionavir and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as interferon beta.
There is experimental evidence of remdesivir's efficacy as of March 2020.
Clinical progress has been made in the treatment of patients who have recovered with reduced use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was brought under investigation in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, a joint review of the study is called for.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
Furthermore, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a dose of one gram per day, notes that taking the drug twice daily is more dangerous and may be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use request for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the request of physicians to treat patients with COVID-19.China's seventh edition of the guidelines also mentioned the use of interferon, ribavirin, or eumelphenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in laboratories.
Nitrioxide laboratory testing was recommended in laboratories after demonstrating inhibition of low-level concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 virus.Studies have shown that high-level protein pumping is important for induction of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor by transmembrane protease serine 2.
Cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies with and without azithromycin have many limitations that have prevented the medical community from using it in therapies other than research.Ocelutamovir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in test-tube studies and has no apparent role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine cysts can complicate health conditions during the acute and late stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytocin-like properties.After a small study was completed, the Chinese National Health Commission included the drug tocilizumab in its treatment guidelines.
After showing positive results in severe patients, a nationwide phase 2 randomized trial is underway in Italy.
This test for detecting cytokine cyclones by assessing serum ferritin in the blood is intended to prevent the development of a condition thought to be fatal in some affected patients.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist approved by FDA for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine symptoms caused by any cause, based on previous case studies, CAR T cell, 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tosalicizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of the small and dense antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS with no results.
Viral inhibition is a plausible mechanism of action by which antibody inactivation therapy enhances the defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis are also possible.
Other forms of antibody inactivation therapy using monoclonal antibodies are also being developed.
Serum production from recovered patients, which involves the extraction of blood fluid from recovered patients and the use of specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased to allow it to spread rapidly in the body.
