Walisish parliamentarians do not wish to appear as muppeters
Members of the Welsh Assembly, known today by the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Party explained his group was worried because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means dustete, and pwp means b√¶sj.
A representative of the Wales-based Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "displeased" and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said his group was open for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word Muppet, which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for dust.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way to the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a uh sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: It is of course the members themselves who have the final determination as to which name they are to be referred to.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the authority to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public hearing which showed general support for renaming the National Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
The representatives' title was supported by the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
The representatives suggest other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to a head-scratch for parliament president Elin Jones, who is due to deliver a legislative draft for the name change in the next few weeks.
The reform will include other changes to how the National Assembly operates, including rules for disqualifying representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last vote on what they are to be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians go to the polling stations to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to their territory, and has on several occasions opposed its membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they must pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are going off  the cricks in Harlem are going off
"The old people I spoke to told me that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams says.
Now there's none of the parts.
He said the bars' abandonment was understandable.
People are socializing in different ways nowadays, he says.
Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which everyone visits regularly.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think.
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he says,  and will therefore only hasten the day when these churches have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol  Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been holding nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was given a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street  one of Harlem's main trade associates  because they failed to employ or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, and when Johnson's father's children made plans for the rebuilding, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was the poor man's church bell.
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: a cultural treasure and the irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world that was played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated game between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are hired by the church's lay leadership and others by the bishopric.
The church's leadership, consisting of lay people, wrote to the bishopric in July about its concern that the bishopric was trying to force costs on the church, despite the fact that the church had not been involved in the hiring of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the bishopric.
Some of the children in the parish complained of lack of openness on the part of the bishopric.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after a hummer in California on Saturday, the first day of the hummer season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought the boy was shouting from delight at having caught a lobster, but he realized later that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn up, says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'", added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Badevakt Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim sustained serious injuries to his upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's has plans to make its entry into the UK beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like make-up and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a major take-up of Britain's 2.8 million-strong beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth as sales of clothing and homewares fall.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's attempt to find a new use area for the space previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the number of beauty products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in noted brand areas, in the same way as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique-smink label with mainly vegan products, because there is a growing demand for these among younger customers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop is testing out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opening in Croydon in south London last week and the other opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a new trend to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets must do more to entice customers to come.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said the sales will eventually resemble a department store, with the supermarket taking up the fight against the Aldi and Lidl department stores with more services and merchandise than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago.
The supermarket's previous attempt to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the partnership was dissolved after a dispute over the distribution of income from the supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 retail pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief marketing officer, said: "We have transformed the look and design of our beauty racks to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are then ready to provide advice and help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the welcoming surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty care competitor representing a new shopping experience.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal worth ¬£11 million.
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-and-accessory brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is the program director of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on her own new gold-lined contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the television gold digger admitted that her new contracts worth up to GBP 1.5 million meant she no longer had time to spare for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would provide her with financial security for the next few decades.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has chosen to retire.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday -- it was right before the launch.
Now a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow is ready for sale.
Experts believe that the This Morning programme host, who is among Britain's most popular stars, could come to cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and cosmetics, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent ownership stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Beautiful facts  And then we fell in love 
He was aware of the criticism he would receive from the news media for coming up with a comment some would regard as little presidentially correct, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his impersonation of a news anchor.
I haven't given away anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big shit on the road to nuclear weapons of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a equivalent response from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States instead still has sanctions that have the purpose of keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his voters.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his work to improve relations with Kim has yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket tests, helping to get released hostages and getting the remains of American service personnel sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to perform with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the area right in front of him.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia devastate island and kill hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideals were told that their help was not needed.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lombok's residents having lost their homes, the city was not declared a national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
In many cases, they have unfortunately made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help. so it is quite challenging, explained Sumbung.
The rescue team is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are still not sure whether foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national crisis management agency, said Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Taken into account the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly ill prepared to handle nature's wrath.
Shelters to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, even though a warning had been sent out, has likely contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's falle-ready infrastructure a major focus of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But money shortages have been a major problem for Joko's administration, which is up for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have gone over to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as Christian and Muslim mobs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equaliser in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri approximately 30 metres from the Chelsea goal as his team were 1-0 down.
He moved the ball to his left foot before he sent it towards the longest corner.
The attempt went high over the box as the ball fell towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as best as they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and touching the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it away.
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's halfway mark.
Kovacic came with a quick pass on the midfield.
He fired off a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defence and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15.00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the men's football Europa League in London at 15.00 on Thursday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude quake that struck the country on Friday caused waves of up to six metres, the agency's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of materials from destroyed buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact us  they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now being told that it will take several hours before they can come back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area was now being treated as a place.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were behind the barricade, while a third car was outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the barricade and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to log 247 from 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in the Parliament is the last memorial to be dragged into the quarrel over rewriting history.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures by his fanatical puritan followers.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing house as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the present debate concerning the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also came to be a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his forefather Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycrofts fantastic portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the views of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a man many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as the parliament's defender against outside pressure.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is still a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-1600s shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.
Slaughter pigs kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only referred to by his last name Yuan, was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured pulmonary artery near a binge at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to administer vaccines to pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province in China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the gate to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the pigsty was a big maniac with blood on his mouth.
A court-ordered medical examination confirmed that the 250-kg pig had killed the man.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mistreated", explained the cousin, known by the surname Wu, in a Guiyang Evening News quote.
A surveillance camera recording showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market's leaders explained that the pig was locked inside to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuans family and the market's management are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Although it does happen, it is not the first time a pig has been recorded attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300-kg pig until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to the average person, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
They're just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they don't try to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain in the southwest United States
As reported, the hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will however bring with her floodwaters on her journey through northern Mexico and southwestern United States during the next few days.
Rosa had a winds of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, a slow motion begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching storm will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Dyptropical humidity will lead to downburst rates of up to 57 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 510 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, particularly over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move about in the desert on foot as long as there is danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to become breddfull, gushing rivers, and thunderstorms can cause local winds to blow and contain dust and sand.
The approaching storm will bring local heavy rainfall to parts of the coastline along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating rubble and rapid, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue throughout Wednesday.
October can bring some intense temperature swings across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We're going to see a clear example of extreme temperature variations across the central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of central and eastern United States will likely get a warm start on October, with degrees high on the twenty-five from the Southern Plains to parts of northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday  this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, on six TV networks, watched Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's surprise in the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a weeklong investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that a drunk Kavanaugh had touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The Friday broadcast was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership was not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has, moreover, as a rule, problems with measuring office owners.
To give you some perspective, this is the same number of viewers as the final game of the American Football Championship or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose media have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led the networks, with average viewership of 5.69 million for the daytime broadcast, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character for Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office came out with a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the courthouse while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes down for several minutes while he was being screened out, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling our country the truth?
He was told that you have power when so many women are powerless.
Flake pointed out that his office had come up with a statement, and said as the heys closed that he came to have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court selection committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be carried on to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of 'political games' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused her opponents of her plan to leave the EU for playing politics with Britain's future and undermining the nation's interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers-plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should obtain each other's tariffs was hell ridiculous.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with premeditated murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS-partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish medical examiner released a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and through the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police for their work to obtain refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and local residents for their contributions to the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for their "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times", Wade said.
Volcano spraying ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Desastres, Mexico's public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico's population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded within a day.
The agency monitored several cases of bullying and rioting.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the front roads of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geofysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after independence protesters clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, and bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Hand-to-hand combat also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit the fighting.
For several hours independence demonstrators stood and shouted "Never forget, never forgive" face to face with unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming overwhelming majority for the release, but it was poorly received because the vote was boycotted by most of those opposed to the release.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote that was held at election stations across the region.
Frigorance groups camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at having a voice, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite achieving a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping the pressure up this year, after many of their well-known leaders have travelled into self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was being stirred up by politicians on both sides.
The situation is becoming more and more tense, he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned in anticipation of a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
'To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government', he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armbrust may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Minga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Livinston's performance stunned Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved decisive, and Gary Holt's side now sits just like Hibernian on second place.
Gerrard's side have still not won away games in the Premier League this season and will play Hearts, who are eight points ahead, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home matches against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has held on to win six games in the division, and Holt has yet to lose a game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against his dull guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after sliding in to face Craig Halkett's header past the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for their guests at the deadball.
And that's how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening  Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a clear line, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
Within this stage, Rangers had the ball largely all the time, but the home team's defense had proved to be unassailable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a nestenscoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston-deathball in a wide card pass.
Crosses came steadily into the Livingston box and were steadily saved, while two punishment requirements  once after Halkett's protest against in-player Glenn Middleton, and once for hands  were overlooked.
Fenomenal from Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and they continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style and the crew have hardly changed since they came back to the top, but Holt should have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration to part with.
Although they have been very good at times under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the match was laber  they only came into the home team's halfway house once  and it was a bit of a wake-up call for Rangers, who are sitting in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in K√∂ln
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the NATO allies.
There have been disagreements over human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to K√∂ln to open an enormous new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police stated security was the reason why a crowd of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers met up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan  many of them Kurds  also let themselves be heard, and criticized both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The contrary demonstrations mirror the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autokrat by others.
Deptford collision: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist is killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car was stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred only one month after a cyclist died in a crash at Childrens Street, about one kilometer from the crash.
The Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and notify the family.
Roadblocks and bus routes are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and is still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado-officials were called in to handle the incident, which involved eight inmates and was limited to one crew.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: Spesial trained prison personnel are being sent in to handle an on-going incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees are being treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons  those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, the riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (can be favorable for drought areas)
That's when Arizona is hit by a tropical low pressure, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert areas of the southwest and brings with it flood danger.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that rain will start late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only twenty tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 510 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some places in the Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert of the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood risk zone, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be favorable, since the southwest United States is currently in a drought.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa hits land at the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa is still hurricane-force Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km, 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving at 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, and loses power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday evening or afternoon.
The downpour over parts of Mexico can be severe and cause great flood risk.
Total rainfall of 7.5-15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with possibilities of up to 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, as it deters moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The expected headwind of Rosa or its remnants is very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This downpour is expected to produce life-threatening flooding and rapid and floating debris in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 04.00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to hospital, and his condition is said to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who may have a mobile recording of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the pettyness and mindset of the Democratic Party.
"A vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reckless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered under the smallness and mindset of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw how brilliant, skilled and courageous Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most accomplished jurists of our time, with a spotless record in public service", he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is that the Republicans vote in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant", he said.
That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats have as their goal to "resist and hinder".
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place Friday, according to an assistant to a Republican Party leader who spoke to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were swept out to sea by huge waves that thundered towards the beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-meter-high waves thundered in the land around sunset, destroying everything in their path and drowning many.
The tsunami came in the wake of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami hazard occurred yesterday, people were still running activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's agency for crisis management (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone, it carried cars, trestams and houses, it hit everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After-earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Pricing and Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force of Friday's tremendous earthquake was about 200 times greater than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as "encompassing" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be larger than the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication was completely crippled, completely without information from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticized for not having informed that a tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had struck before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man in the top floor of a building is heard rushing desperate warnings that a tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes thundering toward the beach, ripping apart buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that hampered communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to over 800.
It's just awful.
World Vision personnel from Donggala have come safely to Palu city centre, where they have sought shelter under a presenning tent on the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed large destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses", he said.
It's just awful.
As aid organizations began the grim preparations to deliver crisis aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with much expertise were denied travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial catastrophe, said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says 'Great, this is a national disaster' we can open the borders to international aid, but the situation has not been given any status yet.
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time since Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that illuminate the gloomy news after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was caught out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescue crews after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding team's coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asia Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon told that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival on Palu.
But the messages only led to gray hacks, rather than a couple of blue hacks.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves steal USD 26,750 during a mini-bank filling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole USD 26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling a minibank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a money bag to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name from  to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: The creation formerly known as Kanye West.
West (41) has been known as Ye for longer, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she cancelled on emotional basis, according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of binding and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's incumbent president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50-year anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, in a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youths into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its financial support for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the US government came forward with announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the US generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan last year to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double budget for AI research would be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough", Lee said.
Double financial support could double the chance that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence will come from the United States", Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's foremost artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat America's best Othello player, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese division.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held, to help find the next generation of smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired smart heads from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
I believe that those with a PhD in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of residence permit automatically, he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing more than $100 million in AI research.
At the same time, the American law enforcement agency's goal of creating a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been stalled for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has vetoed including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new nave, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has created doubts that the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece?
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to gain membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive, because a high enough number of Parliament members have said they will abide by the results of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission has said it had not received any irregularity reports by 13.00.
The turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent at the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
I came to vote because of my children  we belong in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and pulled forward chairs in front of tents set up by those who were to boycott the vote.
We are positive about NATO and the EU, but we will sign in with our heads held high, not be let in the back way, says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a jobless rate of more than 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO, says Zaev after voting.
He says that a "yes" answer will be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum  this is lower than the required number.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents had plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has faced since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 20 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran a race with three Brighton defenders before coming out on open ground.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached up to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to hit Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
 Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal just then.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball laid in on Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the deadline.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoilers for the Rockies
The Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The always competitive Scherzer is hoping to be on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it affects the playoff chances of the Colorado team, which leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies earned a wild card spot with a 52 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but are still out to secure their first division title.
Even if we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will most likely be the highest level of play I get to play at this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of it?
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should be prone to take the Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's assembly in West Virginia
The President referred discreetly to the situation surrounding High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant.
Trump continued, "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power at any cost.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have as their goal to resist and prevent.
And you see that over the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats "mad and bad and nasty and dishonest".
He referred to the senate's court selection and named the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by name, whereupon the audience bowed loudly.
 Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm waiting for one  that was really bad body language  the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am, after all, the last of a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, simply because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I should be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding how important it is to have responsible economic policies, regarding national security, regarding Europe  ironically enough similar matters that Jeremy was disagreeing with former leaders about.
On the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
This is unfortunately no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of a "softer, friendlier" policy is long forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working class, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared many political views suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand up for views I had never previously agreed with, whether they concerned national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly  and it has no bearing on what I say  I get a lot of nasty messages on social media demanding that I be removed, condemning centre-left politics and telling me that I shouldn't be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's been through this.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get are usually political.
I know how professional and focused these colleagues are when they face a sea of gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but they never let themselves be cowed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross malnutrition has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules narrows the party.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years, encouraging me to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because that will make everything better.
But that was not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom in the public school I attended being literally doomed, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can possibly have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the representative proposal on Friday, I would just say that as our country races towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot comprehend and understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.

Ayr 38  17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to tops
Two late attempts have changed the final result a bit, but there was no doubt Ayr deserved to win this fantastically entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
Finally, it was their superior defense as well as their ability to use the opportunities they got that led to the home team going off with the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
We have been challenged in our battles so far and are still undefeated, so I must be satisfied with that, he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All credit to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were".
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, with Frazier's goal kick to Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotch captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the position, and Jason Baggot performed a try without a goal kick.
Climo strengthened Ayr's lead with a penal kick before he, just before the break, scored and kicked a solo attempt to change the position to 175 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a Baggot goal, reduced the distance to five points.
This was followed by a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on a stretcher, and from the start Ayr increased his leadership even more with an attempt from Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose used the extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown at the innings behind the advancing Ayr-Maulen.
Climo delivered a goal kick, as he did again almost completely from the start, after Kyle Rowe retrieved David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
The Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry.
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the restaurant industry  it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with a shelter approval.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, for which he writes the script and stars alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duen has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it looks like Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the case, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's lively restaurant industry.
The ocean is ours: Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Shippers patrolling a riggins-covered marineheld quarter in La Paz.
Public buildings hoist a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.
The entire inland state of Bolivia still has fresh in its memory the coastline lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country longs to once again sail the Pacific.
These expectations are perhaps greater than they have been for several decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
Bolivia has drive, community spirit and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling from the International Court of Justice on big screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague court will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile  after several decades of sporadic negotiations  is obligated to negotiate to give Bolivia a proper outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president  who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year  has also put a lot of thought into Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's side, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN body, which was held in the Netherlands, has no authority to give away Chilean land areas, and has stipulated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling by the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated, according to Paz Z√°rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than have advanced Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, said Z√°rate.
She believes Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has worn away any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations on one or another point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Veltz√©, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile and the opportunity to put a stop to 139 years of disagreement, in favor of both parties.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the maritime situation as a political shelter.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The feeling is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust American authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to abide by the promises they made during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks set to launch the nation's first nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that it is a dream that continued sanctions and American resistance to is declaration that ending the Korean War will ever force North Korea to kneel.
American authorities are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant weapons-grade action.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to release an arsenal the country likely views as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headdresses, heading to a clothing store near you
If you want a big addition to your hat collection or to hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of odd, oversized headdresses as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed motel guests at Fashion Week in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most striking piece of clothing was an oversized beige hat decorated with a feather-like broad brake that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-embroidered watermelons, a trollman hat or even an ananas, but they are not made to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had re-shaped lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than last scream.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including a snorkel and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in a cookie.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats could be heading towards a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another big creation down the catwalk  a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the bathrak model that carries it.
The orange raffia bag, which is bordered with raffia fringes and complemented with a white leather handkerchief, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer. When the designer has had such an impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland's free schools are consistently showing academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with one year of outstanding exam results, underpinned by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free Schools Council), have more than 30 000 pupils across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both pupils and parents.
Friskoles have as their goal to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the words reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the A grade.
The data, which were obtained from the 74 member schools of the FSC, showed that 72 percent of students obtained A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also obtained A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject is now valued at the same level as real subjects such as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited for having problems with occupying a vacancy could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become decisive in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these life-long skills will provide real benefits in the future, regardless of the career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-fold number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those linked to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if every school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered to be most valuable for the UK on the way to 2020, e.g. Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a choice of languages in free schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish free schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied that in today's global business environment, language is still crucial to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should actually be considered as international communication skills.
Friskoler will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction to Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le faire. It is not right to do this.

LeBron is scheduled to make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still not decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career", he replied.
Timing of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President begins a series of election hearings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned rallies over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen high court nominee is on hold, Trump has a goal of gaining support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault.
The main goal of all these meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging November election.
President Trump has therefore said that these five public meetings over the next few weeks have as their goal to upild voluntary and supportive players as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season, Reuters was told by a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
The evening's rally, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and is covered by the Pittsburgh-press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in opinion polls.
It's a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a lift on the opinion polls, said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show fighting spirit to keep the faith as they enter Sunday's single-game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but nevertheless something the players really believe in, particularly at competitions like this one.
And where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we're probably carrying that with us as a little bit of momentum", Jordan Spieth said as he left the court for the day.
Europe will of course have the advantage  they lead by four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel like they've got a little wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered an excellent game from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration screams became higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putt to lift the match to a draw as he and Thomas lay two under after two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream  of the sort that shows he still doesn't think the American team is chanceless.
"We really just have to put all the pieces together and focus on our own match", Spieth said.
That's all each of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but delightful couples have four out of four and don't make a single mistake.
Moliwood was the only pair to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there are no other players the public would rather see secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
It is however too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hooked up with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniards and the Swedes were so far behind that they had no intention of taking back the lead.
But on Sundays, there's no help to be had.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of last day, but this foursomes-session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, particularly in the United States, have lacked.
Europe leads 106 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cup's final day, having completed Sunday's fourballs and foursomes matches with a 106 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories against a downed Tiger Woods, raising their points total for Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, fighting to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unlucky side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 31.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get to take back anything of the lead.
Jim Fury's side must collect eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari  who together have been nicknamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend  are the only pair to score four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked seamlessly to beat downbroken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who held out through two matches on Saturday, glimmered to in-between, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested to the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and performed a 2&1-win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three on the world basis.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this hot day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a hard-fought 2&1-win over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team been able to pull in after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders only Fury's side needs to achieve a draw to retain the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn't look like they'll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will in no way agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened mistrust of the United States, and that the country would not agree to a one-sided release of its atomic weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the World Trade Organization that North Korea had conducted "significant well-will actions" during the past year, such as halting atomic and missile tests, dismantling the atomic testing area and promising not to spread atomic weapons and technology.
We have not seen any corresponding response from the US, he said.
Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual atomic weapons buildup, in which North Korea is rewarded for gradual weapons buildup, but his declaration was significant because it did not reject one-sided atomic weapons completely, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the first ever meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim promised to work toward atomnedrusting of the Korean peninsula, while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end to the Korean War, which raged from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its atomic weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on atomic weapons first, and raises pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal with force, and opposes itself even to the 'declaration on the end of the war', according to Ri.
The belief that sanctions can force us to our knees is a wishful dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions create further mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, as the US leader stressed before the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, and added: "If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as firmly established as it is".
The tone of Rice's speech was however very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland USA with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a missile man on a suicide mission.
After threatening to "fully destroy" North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the United Nations and praised Kim for being brave enough to take down arms, but said much work still remains, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is atomized.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn't have a time frame for this, and said that "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: The Security Council's sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb funding of Pyongyang's atomic and missile weapons programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had progressed, but only hours later North Korea accused him of having come with gangsteraktige claims.
North Korea committed itself in a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a missile range and an atomic weapons facility if the United States did equivalent measures.
He said Kim had said that these equivalent measures he wants, were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures for normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to help students get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of night-time caffeine-fueled nighttime chores.
One academic found that students at the world's best universities often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
After the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why hasn't anyone said this before?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important good sleep habits are for academic and sporting performance and overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's health services administrator, said the university decided to start the course after they saw that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there's a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is to have a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
We realize that this will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know about this, just as you have a right to know about the risks of smoking", said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a certain pride in being able to work all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
Enough and good sleep should be students' "secret weapon" against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even as a means against weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler with the course.
He said the course inspired him to work on a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master's students to take a similar study program before they enroll at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when they should go to bed as well as for when they should get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 10 Rangers: Goal by Menga knocks out Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Minga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to get their first win since February's 41 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches as manager and left behind his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to level the playing field.
Rangers now fall down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from the crowd.
Gerrard made eight bytes for the team, sweeping past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy for how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers had perhaps the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the match when Mengas' first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot towards the goalpost.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than faith in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalties kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson dismissed this.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tamed kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis' opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game's pace, no one could deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player change gave immediate results when the wing sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
However, Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the type of match they like, with Lithgow and Halkett catching long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have struck the lead in the last half, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers' regular Glenn Middleton had a late claim to a penalties kick as he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson saw him off.
Almanak: The inventor of the Geigertal
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the Geigerteller.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and was also made part of popular culture via the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is that?
It's a Geiger counter, it detects radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals gives off.
Evans: Should say it's making a sound now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he named lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now see a protein that is common in many cancers and then inject it back into the patient.
A vaccine under trial has shown promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced her ovarian cancer disappear in over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the lab so that they can see a protein called HER2, which is typical for many cancers, and then injecting those cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said the following: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 drives the growth of different cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and "educated" to target cancer cells, has been used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came out with a fierce defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a smiling performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he lashed out at the Democrats and repeatedly supported Trump.
It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he got to hear it on the backroom regarding the choice of headwear.
They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They bullied me!
And then they said, "I don't understand what reality is", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me understand what reality is?" he said, and said he would put on me the Superman cloak, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments were twisted at least twice, and the employees working at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with a staff member saying: "The whole studio went dead silent".
West was brought in as the last little-replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR STARING IMOT THE MASSES.
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just who he is and that's absolutely amazing.
But I choose not to reward anyone by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their art, which I believe cultivates and spews out ideologies that are harmful to society.
He is free.
So are we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg's colleague has been called Snoop Lion, and so is the late Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
A knife-stick attack on a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
Sick people are expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is reaching out against "toxic masculinity"
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he was very interested in the subject.
"I'm worried about this a lot lately", he said. "What went wrong with masculinity?"
How have we raised men in the face of the problems we see today?
Kit believes that TV may have some of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" because of the strongly masculine roles.
He continued: What is innate and what is learned?
What is being conveyed on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate just this side of being a man?
I think that's one of the really big questions of our time -- how can we change that?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong for young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any forerunners or successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is ready with battlefields and horses.
From November Kit will play the lead role in a new version of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones, is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recording sessions, so that way something good came out of it, my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kitt's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 per cent in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says the health representative.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from earlier cases.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contract HIV in this way is now close to zero, said a Chinese health official at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year by year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men, eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a response to the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects that co-worker leaked data about Republican senators, fyizes of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected accusations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat was assured of the allegations made by ultrakonservative commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included alleged home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a straight lie", Waters continued.
The members of my staff - whose identities, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these dishonest and false allegations  had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a straightforward lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not go on the defensive.
They must not doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly and prudently.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of acting too aggressively during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterms, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
Big  if it's true, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified relevant authorities and the police about these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff".
Annotation by Johnny English Strikes Again  blood-poor Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit-hinty in all new films with a British slant and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parodifranchisee Johnny English actioncomedy  which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-emerged in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satire about how hopelessly hopeless we are become the nation's new export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubbery face has gotten his license to root it renewed for the second time  his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended on territories with non-English speaking cinopublikum.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a d√¶sj Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one single note in the music insert with the fire truck theme during the opening ceremony at the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten television ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There are a couple of great moments in the latest Johnny English tour.
I loved the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but the humor feels rather bloodthirsty and strangely superfluous, especially now that the serious brands like 007 and Mission Impossible willingly have elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and to me Johnny English's faces are not as inventive and pointed as the silent movie lies in Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guarding agent  a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and discouraged figure who is already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort-of-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she must bring in some among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but gives unofficial lessons in secret intelligence.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, plagued aide Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spleshed with an ub√•tkommandant, a hysterical overclassedamerolle where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing up on behalf of the queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the sly Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with farse-like sidesprings: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flamboyant French restaurant, creating chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really dragged out before the last sequence, but even as lovely and noisy as it is, there's a lot that reminds me of children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: could the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they are working out plans to let Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day workweek  but get paid for five.
The party wants apparently that business leaders should use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekday off.
This will mean that employees will receive a three-day week, while they will receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to the four-day week so that workers can also benefit from the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party's desire to swing the pendulum in the workers' favour  in addition to the party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea.
The idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day week is not the policy of the party, and is not something that is considered by the party".
Finance spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profit officials" of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting back the entire share post because a Labour government can take a pay cut out of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place workers in company boards and create employees' funds to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector's equity to employees, who can get an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh may change their minds
The FBI's review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview aired Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley of "60 Minutes" asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was firmly determined, shrewd, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"I have made my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and it must be a startling finding", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it vigorously", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new is going to change that.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to fighting poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of performers and an equally impressive mission: eradicate world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will draw thousands of people to the large lawn in Central Park, not only to experience the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness around the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless one is willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or actions, such as volunteer work, sending an e-mail message to a world leader, taking a phone call or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness around their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called clicktivism - that people feel they're making a big contribution by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million actions from their followers, with a wide range of targets.
They say these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to show 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main engagements are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and entrepreneurs that aims to "help children reach their full potential", and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history, Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the most common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: It will be a long and difficult road  sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon√°e are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy as a blockade to prevent Russian energy exports - the interior minister
Washington can if necessary turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed United States Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's engagement in Syria  especially when operating after invitation from the legal government  is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe", he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
The US has the ability through the navy to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary blockers to ensure that the energy does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an nonprofit organization that profiles itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far on the same path.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel, he said, referring to Russia as one trick pony with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe.
Employees of the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the upassende project The North European Gas Pipeline 2, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow's prison.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar North European gas pipeline, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's glowing resistance to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States' position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reiterated its commitments in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have major problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think seriously" about whether she would run for president after midterm elections.
During a vote in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would stand.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the shaky government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to the core about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy", she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should stand in 2020.
58% of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be silent, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe opinion poll.
32 percent supported her candidacy.
The opinion poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after coming home, I share with other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers carry", she told an audience at a voter event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They come home a little changed, they come home a little hardened, they come home wondering if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and flyers and all other members of the military have contributed to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, clumping with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an amicus curiae brief in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been made public.
She claimed that her partner and his violent gang member sons abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations with pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the Court of Appeals for Immigrants that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "looks back on decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle, said the amicus curiae brief.
The lawyers argued further in the orientation that the policy of denying immigrants access harms the American economy and says that there is a high probability that they will become entrepreneurs and contribute with necessary labor".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, said Sessions in the announcement of 11 June on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems  even all serious problems  that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu  deaths double in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It was very exciting", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
You see ambulances picking up dead people all the time.
Clean water is scarce.
One could see residents coming to destroyed homes and searching through water-damaged property in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are outside Palus's military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing powerful aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get ourselves to safety.
I was squeezed by the wall that was crashing down, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that the family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the ad China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register  the best-selling newspaper in Iowa  after accusing China of trying to meddle in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, US officials said.
It is normal for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tolls on each other's import goods.
China's penalties early in the trade war were to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts report.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has targeted American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register reader's entry: "China is now escalating the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are taking advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
 As a contrast  at the newspaper booth on the street here in Beijing you won't find many dissenting opinions and won't experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China's problematic economic course, given that the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added: "One of China's largest newspapers turned down the offer to publish his article, even though he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before midterm with Kavanaugh-fadesen, warn analysts
As many top politicians among Republicans support and defend high-ranking presidential candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual misconduct, analysts warn that they will face a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiment around this has been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signals that they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be retracted", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) proposal for an FBI-grant in the last second will be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget yesterday's events  they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning protesters sang "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate aisles as the Republicans controlling the judiciary chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say it's been high already, it's true.
But it could be higher, particularly among women uncertain voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which gave a detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the high court candidate, analysts believed that there would be a counteraction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
"This has become a sad day for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee's vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being installed  it's also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat split over who they should believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A recent YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents were either completely or fairly convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were completely or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flake shooting, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the high-ranking justice candidate exposed her genitals to her while they were on a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology giant's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to let people create their own personal data store online or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data store online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should put resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the website Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they should introduce something completely new, which would cause their business models to be completely re-engineered overnight.
We're not asking for your permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Feast of the Victoriakors-recipients from the First World War
The only priest in the English Church to be awarded a Victoriakors during the First World War as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Oberstl√∏ytnant and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never got to know that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "flotted symbolism" that the stone was to be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, Oberstl√∏ytnant Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September through very thick fog and under heavy protection from field cannons and machine guns.
Later he stormed the line of fire and led the line with great courage forward before storming a field gun in his own right and striking out three of the divisions.
Oberstl√∏ytnant Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918  only a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that humbles me".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding: "The loss of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people".
MMA fans were up all night watching the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you've been up all night watching the tightly packed Bellator 206, only to discover that you're not getting to see the main event.
The San Jose native made it through 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in Britain were sitting to mop when the picture suddenly showed Peppa Pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the match.
A Twitter user described the transition to the children's program as "a sick joke".
It is government regulation that it is not appropriate to air such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to children's programs, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa pig, yes!
Bellator's executive director, Scott Coker, said they will work with the sending plan to include viewers in the Storbrannia in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the rematch", Coker said.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday your time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when we crossed over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly the friendly kind.
We tried to fix it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce from six to five matches  that we usually send  and we tried to stretch ourselves far for the supporters, but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of his sexuality
Olympic sprinter Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until he was in junior high school that he realized he wasn't like everyone else.
In the first Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular program host for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, will be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a bit lost on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else he grew up with because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, it's this feeling of inferiority and being different that has been the real motivation and the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador.
He said he stands out because he feels he's lucky to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- he competed in his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was tough to find anyone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his entire perspective had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had obtained tickets to London 2012  since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to be in front of a home crowd during the Olympics, the best feeling ever", he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small  which meant a lot to him in the run up to the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsweak Mickelson taken out to the Ryder Cup golf tournament on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he's got to get in shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennials for the 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome matches.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he so often had been for the United States, the five-time major-winner divides the day between being the heialeader and working on his game at the rank in the hope of straightening up the rogue.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the peak of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough-area still punishes wild strokes.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets, in the ninth game on Sunday, self-proclaimed British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the 12 singles, get a successful start, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He understood fully what role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day", Furyk said.
He has great self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams before, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation brought some immaterial values to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to gossip with people.
I think the younger players had fun trying out against him this week too, and it was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than just the game.
European team captain Thomas Bj√∏rn knows that his great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj√∏rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance to the last day's singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly transform into an unpleasant round.
The Danes debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but carried the victory with the least possible margin, 141‚ÅÑ2-131‚ÅÑ2.
"You constantly remind yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far", said Bj√∏rn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the score on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side -- the best golfers in the world.
Bj√∏rn is very pleased with how his players have fared on the tough golf course and adds: "I couldn't have done it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's individual performance that's going to be the focus, and that's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the limit.
That's the message you have to give to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.
In contrast to Bj√∏rn, opponent Jim Furyk will attempt to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the big turnarounds of the last day, he was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the mirakelet at Medinah.
I remember every damn word of it", he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we had at Brookline, like we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
We set up our setup and then we send people out the way we feel. You know, we try to create something magical in the morning.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the match and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top flight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the player lineup.
"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands up the whole way", Bj√∏rn said of his selections of singles players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
The German navy's newest frigate was supposed to be completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War, but that won't happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The vessel was supposed to have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ordered by the navy back in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is agreed that they should be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from homeport.
Steady delays mean, however, that the advanced warships  they were said to give Germany strength on the sea  will already be outdated before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125-fregatte created headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important software and hardware defects that made the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the crew of older Bremen class frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship has an enormous weight, which reduces performance and limits the navy's ability to undertake upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including training of the crew, has begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euro from the original 2.2 billion euro.
The problems around the new frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's Defence Committee, confirmed that the navy was actually empty of usable ships.
The official said the problem had escalated over time because old ships were outclassed, but no new vessels were coming.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could be used by the navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret lives of the flag mice
New research being conducted at a country estate in the Scottish Highlands will uncover how flaggermice use the landscape in the hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help shape future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common flagger and dwarf flagger mice as well as brown-tongued and water-flagger mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flagger mouse activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flagger musrops and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the flagger mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures should be taken, for example to set up a beitemark and how best to take care of the forest for flagger mice and other associated species.
The flaggermus population in Scotland and Britain has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects younger areas and habitat restrictions.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials and attacks from house cats.
The bat is not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the way when they fly.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes flaggermus very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly conduct surveys, mapping of young places and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own flaggermus reservation at Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flaggermus species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a perfect area for bats", he says.
We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of mapping the flagger mice before maintaining a property, since the sudden destruction of a single nursery can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
Flagger mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish co-worker for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help in the effort.
She says: We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don't know how populations cope.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape accusations against him as "fake news" and says that people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 in the aftermath for keeping a close eye on the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When speaking on a directory video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the accusations as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just saying,
What they said today, fake news, says five times wins of the Golden Ball into the camera.
They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm doing well", adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says the footballer will demand compensation for judgment damages in a range that corresponds to the severity of the offence, which is likely to be one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone back to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99% a good person who was failed by the one percent.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later entered a plea bargain outside the court because she was "scared for revenge" and was also worried about "being publicly hanged".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and moved this summer to Italian side Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will mourn forever the loss of carmakers
Britain will mourn forever if it loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the consequences of delayed border crossing by an eventual Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant  producing the Toyota Auris and Avensis  produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we will see production at our factory stop, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how trade across borders will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what the car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "bespoke" basis, and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be delays at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Brexit plan for further links with the EU is precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border.
We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success in the moment, but to seize this opportunity, he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that increased costs on a long-term basis would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is union leader at the factory, said the members are becoming increasingly worried: "My experience is that once these jobs disappear, they will never come back".
A government spokesperson said: We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with vice justice Rod Rosenstein may be delayed a week while the fight for the presidency of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the vice justice minister or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been nursing up during the speculations in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up the talks with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that was in the process of resigning voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would "preferably" avoid firing Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it colliding with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI-granting on one week regarding charges against Kavanaugh, which further exposed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week postponed because of everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press updated.
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Programmer Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to a reluctance to be self-sufficient, though she added: "I don't disagree with their self-sufficiency".
She then hinted that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
The President does more question rounds than any previous president, she said, adding without providing evidence: We have looked at the numbers
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it would definitely be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it done often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open conferences or press conferences with important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he made a solo run and had at times a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and a wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish parliament member, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence and work permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: Negotiations between the UK and EU on EU membership have been ongoing through the summer and are expected to land on a solution by the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I therefore want to reiterate how highly I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise to strengthen and improve healthcare for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessean.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first period was over.
"He came out on the sideline and kind of just collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no information on the type/scope of the damage yet and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he finished the game, giving him 18 total tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Experts in the Treasury expect it to raise up to ¬£120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the UK  and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young voters with a promise to offer more affordable housing and target high-income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The over-payment  that comes in addition to the current documentation fee, including the higher rate that was introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchase for rent  can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to ¬£120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK.
Many prosperous areas of the country, particularly in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the many foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson came up with proposals to reduce the documentation fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction firms of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on reasonable housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing policy".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling array of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unfounded evictions.
He also wants to give the communities greater power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for non-UK residents, and also foreign-based companies, to buy housing as it is for hardworking British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the situation of the homeless persists.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, who currently hold third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-caps and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I was often with my father and I saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there's always something that pulls me back.
That opportunity would, however, only come if I succeeded in the club management.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League".
"The structure and facilities of this club are undoubtedly Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.
Ross has only been in the leadership for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month brief spell in Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to return from relegation to the Third Division and helped St Mirren to the Championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real roadkill, he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more the right thing than acting.
It sounds weird since I did well, made a decent income from it and experienced some nice high points.
But playing football can be tough.
There's a lot of stuff you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it with respect to stress and pressure at work, but leadership feels totally right to me.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I do, and it feels like the most comfortable thing I've ever known in my entire adult life.
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on Saturdays, survey shows
The summer heat wave has boosted the incomes of Britain's hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 per cent increase in turnover in July  while the incomes for restaurants fell 4.8 per cent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who summarised the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than that of restaurants went down.
Pubs with foodservice also had difficulty with the sun, although not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6.6% that month, with foodservice down by 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and large sports and social events are still the most important factors in terms of turnover on the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a turnover drop of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for foodservice businesses, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide an extended respite.
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of ¬£9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children  some as young as 11  have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, research shows
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren found fake Insta pages.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren found a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts  a reference to photo sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had an innocent "main" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who was encouraging others to "rape" me.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of private schools, revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old pupils had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said, "It's frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the sport in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board and has a non-executive role on the annual general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated freestyle swimmer, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the last ten years.
Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide freestyle environment, and we are sure that freestyle athletes in Scotland will benefit from having her on the board, said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be a voice for athletes, and I hope I can contribute a lot to guiding sport in Scotland".
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has four Olympic gold medals to her name, and is now a regular BBC expert, having suffered a transient ischemic attack that left her unable to walk.
She tweeted: A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm all right again and I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows divide online opinion
A breast pump company has split the online public with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first soundless breast pump that is carried close to the body, Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirty, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a loaf full of hay and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tail and In case you didn't realize, this isn't jur, it's my puppets.
The chorus goes on, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my muffins".
The ad, which is posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it "paints the ugliness" of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth", someone wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets a nice place in a breast-bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?
Another added: "For a failed ad".
Others defend the ad. One woman admitted that she finds the song "incredibly funny".
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product, was it someone who wrote it?
Another commented: This is a funny ad directed at mothers who pump (often at the workplace or toilets) and feel like cow.
This is not an ad that celebrates or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely still, has no wires or slings, and is fitted into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cows, we wanted to shine a light on breast pumping and all the challenges, while also showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved into a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of migrant children arrested has gone up even as the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have been undocumented immigrants, afraid to ruin their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an overriding official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals seeking to be single minority advocates.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Nearly 80% of people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people, says Albence.
The officers are trying to handle the children faster and introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days as was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via videoconference instead of appearing in person to bring their case for a residence permit before an immigration judge.
Those considered as unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the sysemet in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to the tent camp without giving them sufficient time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can reinforce traumas that many already suffer from.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish occupation powers to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as vice-minister, said the foreign forces stayed illegally on Syrian soil under the cover of fighting terrorism and will be treated accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror was over in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue to lead this holy fight until we have purged all Syrian territories both for terrorist groups and all foreign presence.
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said that conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused certain Western countries of spreading irrational flight that causes refugees to stay away.
We have approached the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They politicize what is really a purely humanitarian situation.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria before a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffersone in the rebels' last major defense posture at Idlib has created an opportunity to press on for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed however that the agreement had clearer timeframes and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who will be wiped out.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to call the first meetings of a new committee of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem proposed conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to examination of the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump wants to win another term
According to that logic, Trump would have won reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, impeachment and scandal put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At the moment there is no sign of visual impairment.
Since 2014, the number of viewers for the best prime time show has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything", said Neal Baer, program director for the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a noted comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh".
There is an entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the events unfolding in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Broadcasting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way toward being an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep dipping in background material" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich feather leather jacket (a garment baconed with hubris, the Washington Post said) and the aftermath of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
I certainly don't want to watch Super Mario the same way anymore.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, daily head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump show's varying cast and daily twists on the plot.
You can't miss one episode, or you're gonna be hanging on.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 90 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, Hawaii, but he sat in his room and watched MSNBC while he picked up CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh is about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the United States Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization", Fleiss said.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Money from outside the House of Representatives flows into the most even midterm elections.
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a stream of money after a congressional redistricting that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This recently-opted suburb of Pittsburg is standing with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb who won his seat in another district in a supplemental election last spring.
Lamb is running against another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which in high degree overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was pulled up again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the electoral circuits in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign finance between the largest party funding groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed supplemental election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
The United States considered El Salvador a threat to China, and then withdrew its support.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the leadership team of the Trump Organization.
"The US Foreign Ministry decided to recall the US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US assistance in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the effort to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
However, by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which halted all plans for a punitive action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three American envoys returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From the Story
The next nail in the coffin could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly in the process of expanding the investigation into whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to switch sides, Trump would be put in charge of that body, in the midst of preparations to meet the electors again and perhaps eventually a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not mean to claim that Trump's fall is inevitable  nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that must be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such vippings, and the implacable march of democracy is accelerated or hampered.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tough spot ever since this newspaper reported that he last year proposed secret listening to the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says that The Times's presentation is incorrect.
How will we respond if the recently launched FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is approved for the Supreme Court despite credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the experience I had in Prague.

Rangers' Graham Doran optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A kneskade prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game thinking we could make something and we got one point.
Maybe we could have nodded off at the end, but a draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will probably be a big night in Europe.
We're hoping for three points, but it's going to be tough because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd behind me I'm sure we can get on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but it's a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are having fun; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on now, put the last season behind us and get it done.
Women lose sleep at night because of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their families about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring for you if you do not tell them in advance what you want.
Discuss with the counsellor and the family where and how the care is to be provided.
Take your financial advisor with you: The advisor can also help you to find out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets  if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Get rid of legal problems right away.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to oversee your medical care and assuring you that healthcare professionals will respect your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone a power of attorney over your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a umotiverted action.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communications are out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to get information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that lies closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regentship that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi.
The Regentship, an administrative region under provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of Sulawesi's economy, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nikkel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency management.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, and triggered a 10-meter tsunami that razed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A severe earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused devastation and panic while people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of sexual assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison for an uninsured debt letter worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself not guilty, absolutely when asked how he approached the guilt question, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A felonies, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being heard in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, clumping with the report of domestic violence and for possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and deaths are expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people  a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he mewed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims foreseeably and caused serious bodily harm with intent, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury threw the 22-point indictment, with eight counts of money-laundering-related murder, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized criminality, and a charge of violence and vehicle theft.
The attack required "significant planning and intent", said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "hideous, cruel and corrupt".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the warrant states, and the charges were dropped.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could lead to the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, an married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag on the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were "openly disappointed" over the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobiliser the people's army today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should get feel the pressure from the eurosceptics  when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he should get responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that Britain would have been "extracted" now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go ahead with trying to get to an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the Kaos.
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Br√ºssel.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added: I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan.
When asked to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight two world wars to become subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed claims that the people's opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: I say quite simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Brexit plan is unpopular with the public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are taking to the streets and getting us elected in the first round.
Forget the Brexit plan and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: Statsministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Farage said politicians should feel the pressure if they thought about betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is about trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that they're not going to get away with it.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour political rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app as the conference started.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will evaluate seriously to run for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was speaking about the future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is up for reelection in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been central to speculation about whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrestation after Sims of LSU was killed in a shooting
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
 Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of it, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and carrying a weapon.
Simpson was arrested without charge and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-2 senior who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for the world championship after a stall order gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes stall orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and swept Hamilton from the field while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to drive in the back of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some pushing with the wheels which made the Ferrari driver reluctantly let the inside be free after a double passing to defend himself in third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round on his 21-year anniversary.
He then led in large parts of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He came to the end of the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who got the message to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good toss up", said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her assertion that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "mindless, stupid and untruthful".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and ugly and speaking lies", he said.
When you look at the leaks and the leaks, and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I was just...
I haven't leaked it.
Hey, wait a minute.
Did we -- no, we didn't -- did we, he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent the detailed letter about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's claims, I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who during the party event on Saturday evening commented: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his continued defense of the high court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to get power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by defeating
Patrick Dwyer got two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were given early lead-off shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back on after beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford put up the game as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put up to the Cownies' equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead by pause when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalised once more with a championship goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth out in the end zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Airline directors die to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape earthquakes
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as the hero who secured the safe departure of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers after he died.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to terrorise the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swaying control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved many hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard this", he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll could be as high as several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness agency reports limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
The numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach, said the organ's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six metres of high waves have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "You see ambulances picking up people all the time.
There is a lack of clean water.
The mini markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks in connection with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by a quake earlier this year in Lombok, killing over 550 people.
Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia says one man is missing, and earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that there was one male passenger per Saturday afternoon they did not have oversight of.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while they attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were stable.
The cause of the crash and the precise sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane had crashed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through mid-depth water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a brewhouse also helped with the rescue effort by using a inflatable boat to ferry people to land before the plane sank about 100 feet (30 m) below the waterline.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggest that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts put forward the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed the trial Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
USA Analyst in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert witness on the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile printouts to confuse the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which ran counter to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers's cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said he lied because my trailer was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for around two weeks when she died.
Mobile records suggest they had known each other for only one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new upswing in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York childcare provider sues couple for dismissal after rasistic report
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongful termination message from the mother, who complained that she was "just a black person".
The couple rejects the accusation of racism, and compares the suit to utpressing.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEII ONE BLACK PERSON", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, a comfortable Plasco-Flaxman said off to Maurice, claiming that their disabled nanny, who was African American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for his one day's work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation in the order of $350 per day for the six-month, loji-based arrangement she was promised, though without contract.
"I wanted to show them that, 'Hey, you don't do that,'" she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know that's discrimination".
The couple have backed off the accusations that they are racist and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could trust her after having offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist", the husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post.
But would you leave your children with someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on now.
The comparison of the suit with utpressing says Plasco owed that his wife only had two months to terminate and was in a very difficult situation.
Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
It's not particularly pretty, the stockbroker added.
While the legal case is going on, the court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success.
She says his father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small teddy bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected.
She describes Paddington as a very important family member and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child do something: you're proud of it even if it's not really your fault.
I think he viewed Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
At landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad, that he didn't think she would survive, said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a moment earlier and the organs in her body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, certain that it was happening.
I couldn't scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know about the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", she says.
I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards of mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was struck by depression and took his own life at 18.
I don't want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day, she says.
Sharon, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room.
He quit his job before he died because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his own life.
Sharon says, "I worry all the time about the effects of the heat".
Sharon made the cards to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit by yourself - you need to talk to someone.
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything", she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in mood.
On the first day of Christmas he was in the basement. When the kids opened the gifts, they didn't have eye contact or anything.
She says his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: It tears up a big hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to persevere and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get to some of what he asked for, a time- and scope-bound investigation, we could maybe come to some agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "fall apart" along fixed party lines.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6. If the Republicans presumably do poorly, it will be considerably more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling around to senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 Senate votes, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote to get him into the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's assembly department, said there had been 1127 dismissals last year  compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices among human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most North Korean hopefuls are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights are made via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the displaced illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them by force.
The relationship between North and South , which is still technically in war , has improved considerably over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on the outcome of the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they in large part agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally step down first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost shouting and crying as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesk and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony showed he couldn't sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this: If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but also the court he's sitting on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (an appellate court).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overrule certain high court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it", Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous rage, months and years in which the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that weird, do you?
She continues: "I got a lot of help from a woman who was my supervisor somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You think maybe I'm sad because I'm crying".
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was amazing.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office, where I started crying in inexplicable rage and was grabbed by the collar of an older woman -- a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of -- who dragged me up the stairs.
"Don't let them ever see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and happy because they managed to take you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed for cheating on his wife on board a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way of investigating the possibilities of running as a presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it was near the end of the campaign, she lagged behind with the financing and swore she would not settle if she did not get in 2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of the supporting actors who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude toward the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism -- that she broke down in tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls of how the press referred to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, "Guess what they'll write on my tombstone?"
She cried?
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening salves of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and even if the fight far from over, a rift between the countries could be favorable for Beijing long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired off the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation happened this week with new tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars, which means tariffs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has of course retaliated every time, most recently with a five to ten percent charge on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy probably won't raise the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure around the trade war with the United States could give China a positive long-term outcome by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ripples in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have realized before, said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ready for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to re-establish the country, which is devastated after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions were improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism, he says.
The state continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that affected their everyday lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would take good care of helping to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that no conditional assistance or aid from countries that supported the uprising would be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup wins in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj√∏rn got the 14,5 points they needed to beat the United States.
USA star Phil Mickelson, who was slipping through large parts of the tournament, made his tee-shots in the water at par-3 16th hole, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all of his rounds and became one of four golfers to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament took its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbj√∏rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most successful European throughout the years with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help, said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the staff to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods. I followed that man closely growing up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An odd statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the entire weekend trying to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I'm gonna look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.
Update on algae blooms: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from Florida's Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red algae concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are reports of fleck-like upsprings in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County, suggesting reduced concentrations.
A bloom of red algae stretches about 210 km along the coast, from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are spots around 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red algae have also been observed in Pasco County.
There have been reports of moderate to high concentrations at or off the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, natural to high concentrations in Manatee County, natural to high concentrations off the coast of Sarasota County, natural to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, natural to high concentrations off the coast of Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
There is still reported irritation in the airways of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier County.
No irritation was reported in the airways of northwest Florida during the past week.
