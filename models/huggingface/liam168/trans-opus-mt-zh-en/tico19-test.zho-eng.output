The cumulative incidence of the new coronary virus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020
In the EU/EEA countries, as well as in the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of the new coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends, confirming that, although different countries are at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly.
In Italy ' s experience, the State, hospitals and intensive care wards need to be better prepared to cope with the surge in the number of COVID-19 patients, with a particularly heavy burden of intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of undisclosed pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported that pathogens are a new type of coronary virus, now known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoMV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been named as coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
Of the approximately 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 will progress to a critical condition and will require hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent will progress to a critical condition and require intensive care.
The death rate of patients hospitalized as a result of COVID-19 is about 4 per cent.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/European Economic Area, EEA), as well as in the United Kingdom (UK), and compared it with the Hubei Province of China.
We have also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020 with Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the current dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are similar to those of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the magazine European Monitor, published on 5 March 2020, Speteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO definition of cases.
In EU/EA, on 24 January 2020, France reported the first three confirmed cases of persons returning from the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EA countries, as well as the United Kingdom, had detected COVID-19 cases, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from December 31 to March 15, 2019, including that date, of which 17,750 and 1,441 deaths were reported in Italy alone.
Cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates every morning at 8 a.m. the number of reported COVID-19 cases in every country in the world, obtained only through official sources, such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data have been used to assess trends in EU/EA and COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, and are compared with Italy.
We calculated the 14-day contraction cumulative incidence of every EU/EA and British COVID-19 cases between 1 January and 15 March 2020 as indicators of the incidence of active COVID-19 cases in order to consider the natural pathology of COVID-19.
We also provided the total number of reported cumulative cases per country as at 8 a.m. on March 15, 2020, and compared with data from Italy for the period from January 31, 2020 to March 15, 2020.
EU/EA Country and UK COVID-19 Trends
The 14-day trend in the cumulative incidence of seizure of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom is generally consistent with the trend in Hubei Province (China) (figure 1).
For EU/EA and the United Kingdom as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February 2020 and then increased sharply around 28 February (supplementary material).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but a similar trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EA countries, as well as in the United Kingdom (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom between 31 January and 15 March 2020, compared with Italy.
It should be emphasized that by 8 a.m. on March 15th, the other 15 EU/EA countries and the United Kingdom had reported the same total number of cases as Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported by EU/EA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly.
The observed trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the epidemic is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, national public health responses vary, the definition of cases may vary from country to country, and there are differences in the programmes used to select patients who must undergo CIVD-19 diagnostic tests, including additional tests, but the situation is the same.
In early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected areas of Italy, approximately 10 per cent of the COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care, and media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care wards in those areas had reached maximum capacity.
At the EU/EA level, the data available are only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of the cases of COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care ward, respectively (the data are not shown).
However, such information should be collected in a systematic manner in order to complement the current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed that the number of intensive care and medium-term care beds available in European countries varied widely, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and medium-term care per 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
ECDC's sixth update of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment modeled the saturation of health care capacity and associated scenes and estimated the relationship between the prevalence rate in each EU/EA country and in-patient COVID-19 patients in the United Kingdom and the risk & gt; 90% over the number of intensive care beds.
Since so far cases have gathered in the EU/EA countries and in certain areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care wards generally provide services for the population coverage in the defined areas, it is advisable to provide information on cases and intensive care beds at the level of the Standard Statistical Geographical Unit 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy, as well as current trends in other countries, shows that the EU/EA and the British COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly.
Therefore, the State, hospitals and ICUs should be prepared to respond to the continuing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially ICUs, such as in affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 and requires a transition from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases, if not implemented ahead of time, may leave decision makers and hospitals with insufficient time to understand, accept and adjust response measures.
The rapid risk assessment also identified public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity that countries have the potential to further strengthen controls to slow down SARS-CoV-2 transmission and reduce pressure on health care systems.
Otherwise, the health-care system in other EU/EA countries is likely to face a proliferation of patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronary virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths and a huge human catastrophe.
Similar to its homogenous virus SARS-COV, which in 2003 caused thousands of people to become infected with SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality rates than SARS, it is more communicable, affecting more older persons than young people, and more men than women.
In view of the rapid increase in new coronary pneumonia-related publications, this paper is intended to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving research subject.
We will present basic knowledge of epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this synthesis will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and engraved memory of the Chinese, and the outbreak of a new viral disease forced all people to leave their homes throughout the holidays and the weeks that followed.
The virus is highly homogenous with the coronary virus (COV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the related disease is known as coronary virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country, before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients had been discharged and more than 3,000 had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 has become the “first public enemy” and that its threat may exceed that of terrorism.
According to data from PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment since 7 January 2020, when first reported the separation of the virus sequence from multiple patients.
The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the progress of research in this emerging field of disciplines.
It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CV-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss the knowledge gained so far on the prevention of the disease and its aftermath, as well as some pressing issues that remain to be resolved.
In the past, CoV was thought to be a non-lethal pathogen for humans, causing about 15 percent of the common cold.
But this century has already met two highly pathogenic humans, the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, which broke out in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries, with terrible morbidity and mortality rates.
So this COVID-19 outbreak is the third CV outbreak recorded in human history.
As figure 1,1 shows, the city of Wuhan first reported a number of undisclosed cases of pneumonia to the National Health Council of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, medical personnel were reported infected, warning of possible humanities.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan sealed the city and closed all public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the new coronary pneumonia reported that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhanhua South Sea Fish Market, which was considered the starting point for infection from unknown animal sources.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a “global health emergency”.
At the time of publication of the present report, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the globe (figure 2 (Fig.2).
Owing to the rapid development of the epidemic, the final scope and severity of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 diagnosed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of the epidemic, as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting all age groups, but the main age group is 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31 per 100,000) than women (0.27 per 100,000).
COVID-19 is concentrated in the north of the lake and its surroundings.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of the disease to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time between morbidity and death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic regeneration (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of large population movements prior to the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and for all patients the adjusted mortality rate was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (~60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large sub-family of a blanket virus with a single justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and platinum, of which alpha-CoV and beta-CoV are known to be infected with humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV ' s cytocytic vascular tension transfer enzyme 2 (ACE2) and diphthrin enzyme 4 (DPP4) are combined, and the membrane is integrated.
The virus RNA genome was released into the cytology; after the reproduction of the virus genome, the genome RNA formed a cystic bubble containing the virus, together with the packaged syrup protein as well as the nucleotide protein, then integrated with the membrane and released the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
As a result, SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV, with genetic consistency exceeding 99.98 per cent of the 10 sequenced samples taken from the Wuhan South Sea Fish Market, the original site of the outbreak.
SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV in genetic terms than MERS-COV.
By ejecting the electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in ultra thin slices of the airways.
AACE2 was found to be the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the weak combination of S proteins with ACE2 relative to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infection to be less serious than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins coded by orf3b, as well as secreted proteins coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFN beta; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional structure domain or base sequence.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported on the refrigerated electron microscope (cryo-EM) structure of the all-man ACE2 complex with amino acid trans-protein B0AT1 with a resolution of 2.9 Å.
They found that the compound had an open and closed image, that it was assembled as a binary, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins to provide evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a drug-screening treatment target for SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Origin and intermediate host
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and spread to humans through beavers and camels, respectively.
By comparing the system development of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other CoVs, bats are considered to be natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because of the 96% consistency of the new virus with the two SARS models from bats, Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-CoVZX21, respectively.
However, it is not clear what intermediate host assists in the transmission of the virus across the species barrier to humans, and the means of its transmission are yet to be clarified.
Ji et al. suggested that snakes were virus carriers from bats to humans, which involved a homogenous reorganization within S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that the puncture of puncture is a potential intermediate host for SARS-COV-2, given the 99 per cent genetic homogeneity of a CoV and SARS-COV-2 found in the punctuation of a punctuated arc, a long-kissed ant-eating ant, which is often used for Chinese medicine.
However, the difference of 1 per cent between the two genomes is still a huge difference; therefore, specific evidence is yet to provide a decisive result (Fig.33).
The physicochemical nature of SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro in a dry environment for 48 hours, up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may be of a similar nature.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be effective in fighting the virus with ultraviolet and thermal sensitivity - 56 °C 30 minutes; Ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other lipid solvents, but chlorine has been determined to be ineffective in killing the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies on SARS-CoV-2 immunization responses.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, after the invasion of the host, the virus is first identified by the host ' s inherently immune system through the mode of identification of the receptors (PRR), including C-type condensate sample receptors, Toll sample receptors (TLR), NOD sample receptors (NLR) and RG-I sample receptors (RLR).
Viruses are expressed through different road-to-road induction inflammation factors, tree mutagenic cell maturity, and the synthesis of the I jammers (IFN), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the ingestion of its antigen cells.
But SARS-CoV's N protein can help the virus escape the immune response.
Adaptive immunization responses will soon be added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+T cell irritation B cells generate virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+T cells directly kill infected cells.
Auxiliary T cells generate inflammatory cell factors to help these defensive cells.
However, CoV can suppress T cell function by inducing T cell failure.
The immunisation of body fluids, including rehydrates — such as C3a and C5a — and antibodies, is also essential to the fight against viral infections.
For example, the antibodies separated from the recovered patients can be neutralized with MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excess response of the immune system can generate a large number of liberal bases, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, characterized by a concentration of sexually transmitted diseases, are more likely to affect older persons with multiple syndromes, as well as pregnant women.
Typically, individuals exposed to a large number of viruses or impaired immune functions are more likely to become infected than others.
According to a study of the earliest 425 cases in the city of Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 has an average latency period estimated at 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that, according to the demographics of 8,866 cases, the lurking period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust the effective time of isolation to the most accurate latency period so as to prevent the transmission of the virus to others by people with an asymptomatic infection.
As a rule, people exposed to the virus or infected usually need to be isolated for 14 days.
Should the period of isolation be extended to 24 days?
Heating is usually the main and initial symptoms of COVID-19, and can be accompanied by any other symptoms, as well as symptoms such as cough, aerolysis, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, abstinence, aldicarb, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced respiratory difficulties and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome, peptotoxic shock, metabolic acid poisoning and certilisational disorders are rapidly advanced by the severe.
Even in the absence of pulmonary imaging anomalies, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should undergo viral screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out in late December showed that the percentage of all symptoms was: fever, 98 per cent; cough, 76 per cent; respiratory difficulties, 55 per cent; diarrhoea, 3 per cent; and air support, 8 per cent of patients.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies on family agglomerations of sexually transmitted diseases and the insymptoms of individual transmission leading to agglomerations.
In contrast, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of the MERS-CoV patients were fever (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and respiratory difficulties (55 per cent).
However, 80% of these patients need air support, much more than the COVID-19 patients, in line with the MERS mortality rate, which is higher than the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26 per cent) and abstinence (21 per cent) were also observed among MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, fever (99-100 per cent), cough (29-75 per cent), respiratory difficulties (40-42 per cent), diarrhoea (20-25 per cent) and abstinence (13-25 per cent) have been shown to be the main symptoms, with about 14-20 per cent of patients in need of air support.
As of 14 February, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide reached 66,576, with a 2 per cent mortality rate.
In contrast, as of November 2002, the SARS mortality rate was 10 per cent in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37 per cent.
An early study reported that SARS-CoV-2 ' s R0 was as high as 6.47, 95% confidence range (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV ' s R0 was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 presents a comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher proliferation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the latter.
Controlling SARS-CoV-2 epidemics is therefore more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Aggregation of sexually transmitted diseases usually occurs within the same family or from the same gathering or transportation, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travelling or living in Wuhan or other epidemic areas, or of having close contact with infected or infected persons, in the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who had been discharged from the hospital could carry the virus again, thus warning of prolonged isolation.
The patient ' s number of hemoglobin cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages of the onset of the disease is normal or decreasing.
For example, white cell count & lt; 4x109/L - including lymphocyte count & lt; 1x109/L - was found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, an increase in amino amino acid transfer enzyme levels and viral haemorrhage.
In some cases, hepato enzymes and muscle enzymes, as well as myored protein levels, were observed to be higher in the blood, and in most cases the blood C reacts to higher proteins and haemorrhage.
Increased levels of D-dimonomers and reduced lymphocytes were observed in heavy patients as a result of blood fibrous protein degradation products.
Most of the COVID-19 patients were exposed to chest image abnormalities, characterized by bisectional filamental shadows or pulmonary grinding glass.
Atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common among patients.
Uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and fibrosis can seriously damage gas exchange when ARDS occurs.
The osteoporosis of the upper pulmonary bubbles I and II reduces the level of surfactants and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst chest imaging findings usually occur at the same time as the most serious of the diseases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis by COVID-19 found in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease pulmonary loss, translucency membrane formation, intertonic lymphocytes immersion and polynucleic cellular cells, consistent with viral infections and the pathological performance of ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19 by reversing the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
However, as higher pseudo-negative rates may accelerate the epidemic, China began to use clinical evidence for diagnosis (and no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) in February 2020.
A similar situation occurred when SARS was diagnosed.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical performance, laboratory examination and video results is essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Zhang Feng team reported on a programme to detect SARS-CoV-2, using CRRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which uses a test paper to detect concentrations of just 20 x 10-18 moL/L to 200 x 10-18 moL/L (10-100 virus copies per microlitre) in a synthetic SARS-COV-2 RNA segment, without the need for complex instruments.
If validated in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly increase the sensitivity and accessibility of diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in treating new types of CoVs, doctors mainly provide support treatment to the COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with various therapies used or proposed for other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
These include current and potential treatment methods, such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support for recovered patients.
It is even recommended that the plasma of a rehabilitated patient be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially mainly attacked the lungs, and may also express ACE2 other organs, such as gastrointestinal systems and kidneys, at a relatively low level.
Nevertheless, respiratory disorders and failure are the main threats to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential to mitigating symptoms and saving lives, including conventional oxygen, high-flow oxygen, non-constructive and mechanical air, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by the In vitro Oxygen (ECMO), an improved cardio-pulmonary by-passive technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sepsis shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is well known that excessive immune system responses by SARS and MERS patients can lead to cell factor storms.
Cell-based storms are a form of reaction to systemic inflammation, characterized by the release of a range of cell-based factors, including TNF-α, IL-1-beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and MCP-1.
These cell factors induce a large number of immune cells to release free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunization inhibition is essential in the treatment of cytogenetic storms, especially among severely ill patients.
The cortex steroids and beads, an anti-IL6 monoclon antibodies, have been used to treat cytological storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytogenesis storms include: regulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; interdiction of IFN-Gamma, IL-1 and TNF; suppression of JAK; Bona's Tile resistance; cell factor signal transfer inhibitors; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants for SARS to reduce the severity of the damage caused by inflammation.
However, large-dose steroids do not contribute to severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they may have serious side effects, in particular haemorrhage, which seriously affect prognosis.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that the use of low- and medium-dose cortex steroids in patients with critical covid-19 be prudently treated for short periods.
At the time of writing, the existence of effective ART had not been confirmed.
However, it has been found that Radxive, a nucleotide-like drug, has been effective for a COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Red Silvey is a new antiviral drug developed by Gillid, which was initially used to treat diseases caused by the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus.
Later, it was also proved that Redeswell might suppress other single-chain RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
For these reasons, Gillid has provided the drug to China for two clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, the results of which are to be expected.
In addition, it has been proposed to use Barrickerni, alpha-combustine, Lopinawa/Litonave and Libavelin as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur as a result of joint treatment in Lopinawa/Litonave.
The interaction between these treatment methods and other drugs used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Pulse and antibody formation of recovered patients
The collection of blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the protection of healthy individuals from the disease has a long history.
In practice, rehabilitated patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
The antibodies are an immunoglobin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes against pathogens and other things, which can identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly middle them.
Based on this principle, plasma was collected from a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and injected to 10 patients at risk.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads and increased saturation.
However, prior to the development of specific heterogeneous therapies, there is a need for validation and clarification in order to suggest methods that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered in the light of the effects of the treatment.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cell factors to release syndrome, a toxic reaction that may endanger life.
Antibody concentrations in blood are generally low, while plasma demand for treatment of patients at risk is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies sufficiently quickly to confront a global epidemic.
Thus, the more critical and practical methods are: separation of B cells from recovered patients and identification of the genetic code for coded effective antibodies, or screening of effective antibodies for proteins necessary for the virus.
In this way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
In China, the use of TCM for the treatment of multiple diseases is thousands of years old.
However, the efficacy of the treatment depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components in the prescription, which differs from the diagnosis of diseases based on the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and validate such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatment methods for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from a severe phase, due to the lack of effective and heterogeneous therapy for COVID-19.
For example, sterilized capsules and platinum capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In several provinces of China, 87 per cent of patients use TCM treatment, with the highest cure rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei province only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients use TCM treatment, with the lowest cure rate (13 per cent).
However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other factors of influence, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Chambere and her colleagues published a study on the comparative western drug (WM) stand-alone treatment and joint treatment with WM and TCM.
They found that WM+TCM group temperature recovery, dissipation of symptoms and hospital stay took a significantly shorter time than the NM group.
Most impressive of all, the symptoms deterioration rate (from light to heavy) of the WM+TCM group is significantly lower than that of the simple WM group (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent) and the mortality rate of the WM+TCM group is equally lower than that of the simple WM group (8.8 per cent versus 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still need to be confirmed by better quality control tests, greater scope and more centres.
The identification of TCM treatments or their combinations of role mechanisms and, where possible, the articulation of their active components will also be of concern.
Most of the patients suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19 are extremely frightened by this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and the isolated are distressed, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency and cough, as well as adverse treatment responses, such as insomnia caused by cortex steroids, may increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A range of psychological reactions were reported in the early stages of the SARS outbreak, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychooptimism, psychiatric symptoms, cynicism and even suicide.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory close contact tracking and isolation increases anxiety and guilt over the impact of infection, isolation and stigmatization on their families and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected cases, persons in close contact, and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, with clear communication through regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic equipment and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain from the animal host and infected to the vulnerable, and are often used as a supplement to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has made efforts to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective intermediate and antibody and/or protective immunization against SARS-CoV.
The detoxification vaccine has been evaluated in the SARS animal model.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical research, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in old age and lethal assault models and their protection against co-human and animal viral infections had not yet been determined.
It's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, the persistence of co-human and animal diseases in the epidemic zone has led to the persistence of sporadic cases and concentrated infections in the Middle East region and their spread to other regions.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models, through the use of live viruses, DNA particles, viral carriers, nanoparticles, viral sample particles and recombinant protein substrates.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine for non-immun individuals against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required for vaccine development (average of 18 months) and the dynamics of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to present its complete clinical process among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually, without any after-effects.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, covid-19 patients also have high morbidity and mortality rates.
Therefore, the establishment of a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to the clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect the prognosis or subsequent relevance of the COVID-19 patient (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor influencing SARS prognosis, as is COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study that included 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7 per cent were over 50 years of age.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have basic co-conversion and complications, and to be significantly older than patients in need of intensive care (median 66-51 years), suggesting that age is a prognosis in the outcome of the COVID-19 patient.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men than women are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/10 million vs. 0.27/10).
Combining and complications: patients who require intensive care in COVID-19 are more likely to suffer acute heart damage and heart disorder.
Heart events are also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be associated with ACE2 positive choreology cells, which may lead to liver abnormalities in the COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely related to and may affect one another with regard to underlying diseases.
Laboratory results were abnormal: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in blood reflect the severity of the inflammation or tissue damage and are considered a potential prognosis factor for disease, therapeutic response and eventual recovery.
It was also suggested that CRP levels were relevant to the severity of COVID-19 and its prognosis.
In addition, the rise in emulsion dehydrase (LDH), amino amino amino acid transfer enzyme (AST), amino amino transfer enzyme (ALT) and mycetic streptic enzyme (CK) may also help to predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
As such, they are traditional symbols of heart or liver function disorders.
Main clinical symptoms: The timing of chest imaging and clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues to predict the fate and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As previously mentioned, steroids are immunosuppressants, usually used as an ancillary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of the damage caused by inflammation.
As a result of the widespread use of large doses of cortex steroids for heavy SARS patients, many survivors suffer from haemorrhage, leading to lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at small doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients, if required.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients were under great stress, as they were often subjected to prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of relatives and affinities.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are needed to help these patients to get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to differ from SARS.
In addition to reproduction in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or insymptoms in the early stages of the infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
As a result, infected persons generate a large number of viruses in the course of their day-to-day activities in the early or latent stages of the onset of the disease, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur when the patient is seriously ill and most of it does not occur at an early stage.
As a result, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than SARS.
China is currently making enormous efforts, including the blockade of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued isolation of almost all its population, with a view to disrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have already caused serious economic and other damage in China, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and that the phase of decline will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts were less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have developed models for predicting the consequences of the epidemic, arguing that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to infect two thirds of the global population.
A Canadian team reported that two weeks ago, patients who recovered and discharged from hospital detected SARS-CoV-2 in the middle nasal and swab, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclical epidemic similar to influenza.
However, with the reduction in the number of new cases, there are already encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus was predicted to cause 1 million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become less contagious, eventually disappearing or becoming a less pathogenic virus coexisting with the human body.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and possibly even through direct contact with virus-contaminated items.
The virus has also been found in excreta, thus increasing the likelihood of its transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases, 41 per cent of which may have been caused by in-patient infections, included 17 patients who had previously suffered from other diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, more intensive preventive measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with the patient or infected person.
The first line of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 dust masks (1860s series) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgery masks prevent droplets from potential infected persons from spreading in the air or sticking to the surface of objects that may be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (1860s series) masks prevent inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses are fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, all of which are about 85 nm.
Since viral particles can even penetrate five folded surgical masks, medical personnel in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (1860s series) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, medical personnel should wear isolation suits in order to further reduce their exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 with a N95 mask; the virus could have entered its body by inflaming eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent masks or goggles in the face of patients.
For the general public in areas affected by or potentially affected by the epidemic, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with disinfective soap more frequently than usual, remain as isolated as possible indoors and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered the right distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 broke into the human world as a new virus, the high level of homogeneity with SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020, based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak, should have caused a high level of alarm in China.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Wuhan City was still plaguing the citizens, saying that the new virus was not very contagious, that the possibility of human transmission was limited and that the epidemic was preventable.
The news clearly eased the public's vigilance, and the upcoming Spring Festival was missed as the key node to contain the epidemic in Wuhan.
China ' s disease control agencies may learn from this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these bodies should (1) be more cautious in issuing announcements, since each word is vital to citizens and can change their attitudes and decision-making; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) control potential outbreaks more strictly at an early stage than attempt to appease the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, began at the end of December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the globe.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-COV, and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more older persons than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality of older patients is higher than that of younger patients.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
Even in the absence of symptoms, COVID-19 patients transmit the virus, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus in serious cases, making it much more difficult to control COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, a cured patient may turn to the sun again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Given the rapidness of the research on COVID-19, the following key issues remain to be resolved:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of 96% genetic homogeneity between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats like SARS CoV, we can't come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What kind of animal transmits the virus from the original host — hypothetically, bat — to the human intermediate host?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to effectively cut the transmission route, and the outbreak could be repeated at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analyses have proved that SARS-CoV-2 is combined with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the aerocytes and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also combine cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to those questions, we cannot achieve rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in the process of human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic? Will it disappear like SARS? Or will it recur like a flu?
Finding answers to the above and to many other questions is crucial, but it may take longer.
However costly, however, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic and return our lives to normal as soon as possible.
The genesis of the human and animal coitus of the human coronary virus.
For thousands of years, mutagenicity and adaptive power have driven the common evolution of the coronal virus (Coronavirus, CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronary viruses (HCOVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed the destructive and deadly nature of HCOV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of the year again made CoV the focus of attention and, surprisingly, its sister virus SARS-CoV is more communicable than it is, but less pathogenic.
HCOV infection is a common disease of humans and animals, so it would be helpful for us to know the origins of HCOV.
Most HCOVs come from bats and are non-pathogenic.
Some of the intermediate storage hosts of HCOV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts is of direct importance in the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV host interactions in animals may also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of coV morbidity in humans.
In this synthesis, we outlined the existing knowledge of seven HCOVs, highlighting their discovery history, the origins of co-human and animal diseases and inter-species transmission.
What's important is that we compare and contrast different HCOVs from the point of view of the evolution of the virus and the reconstitution of the genome.
In this context, we looked at the current outbreak of 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19).
In addition, the paper focuses on the requirements for successful host conversion and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease.
CoV is a coronary virus and consists of a group of justice single-chain RNA viruses with a membrane.
These viruses have the largest genome of the RNA virus, with 2.6 to 32,000 bases, known as "CoV" because of their coronary form under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoV has a non-fragmental genome of a shared similar organization.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open-reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp. 1a and pp. 1ab for reproducing enzyme polypolyte.
These polypolymer proteins are further processed, producing 16 unstructured proteins called nsp1-16.
The remainder of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins, including puncture (S), film (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Many spectra-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by CVs in different spectral systems.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four rows (α-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and platinum-CoV), in which beta-CoV consists of most HCOV and is broken down into four spectra (A, B, C and D).
Systematic developmental evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main hosts of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross the species barrier, some of which have become important human pathogens.
To date, seven human-infected coronary viruses (HCoVs) have been known.
Among them, HcoV-229E and HcoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other 5 beta-CoVs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 generally cause mild symptoms, such as common flu and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2 and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients, and are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (Accute Respiratory Dispress Syndrome, ARDS) and lung exterior manifestations.
In the mid-60s, the first HCOV-229E virus strain B814 was separated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients.
Since then, humans have accumulated more relevant knowledge through extensive research into both HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses, which can cause self-restrictive symptoms.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the notion that HCOV was usually harmless was widely accepted.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating events in the current history, with more than 8,000 infections and a crude death rate of about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the epidemic continued to spread in the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to the rest of the world.
2019 The new HCOV virus (2019-nCoV, renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen of the persistent 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, has taken over 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm has been sounded, and the world must be ready for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCOVs have a co-origin of human and animal disease from bats, rats or domestic animals.
There is a wide range of evidence that suggests that all HCOV evolution originates in bats, where the virus is well adaptive and non-pathogenic, but displays great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic poses enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world as a whole.
Tracking the origins of HCOV human and animal diseases provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and constraints of the leaping of viral species.
In addition, it will guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage hosts, intermediate hosts and extended animal hosts, which will be important in preventing future virus spills.
In this overview, we provide an overview of HCOV ' s human and animal co-generation, inter-plant transmission and morbidity mechanisms.
In particular, we have highlighted and explored a common topic, namely, the intergenerational virus of HCOV, which is usually not pathogenic in its natural hosts, but pathogenic after trans-species have spread to new hosts.
In addition, we have reviewed the trend of HCOV evolution, in which the increase in transportability is often accompanied by a reduction in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Animal CoV has been well known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first separation of HCOV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretion of common cold patients, medical practitioners had separated different CoVs from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven types of HCOV have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCOV discovery in chronological order (table 1) would provide us with a wealth of information and guidance.
In 1966, the first HCOV-229E virus strain was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung strain.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E suffer from common cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, discomfort, throat pain, and 10-20% from fever, cough, etc.
In the second half of 1967, HCOV-OC43 was separated from organ culture in the breast and subsequent successive generations.
The clinical characteristics of HCOV-OC43 infections are similar to those of HCOV-229E and do not differ significantly in symptoms from other respiratory pathogen infections (e.g., influenza A virus and nasal virus).
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed globally, mainly during the winter period of temperate climate.
Usually, these two viruses have less than a week of incubation, followed by approximately two weeks of incubation.
A human volunteer study shows that healthy individuals infected with HCOV-229E have a mild common flu.
Only a few low-immunisation patients showed severe lower-respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia”, is the first fully documented pandemic in human history caused by HCOV, the pathogen of which is SARS-CoV, the third detected HCOV.
The first example is the SARS case, dating back to the Guangdong Province of China in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, which spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to the super-transmitters, it is estimated that each case may result in approximately 2 secondary cases, with incubation periods ranging from 4 to 7 days, with a peak in viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
The patients infected with SARS-CoV initially suffered from muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and cold warfare, followed by advanced symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, coughing and respiratory distress.
The reduction of lymphocytes, hepatic function abnormalities and the rise of mycetic streptic enzyme are laboratory abnormalities common to SARS.
In addition, amplitude pulmonary pulmonary damage, upper cylindrical growth and an increase in macrophages were observed among SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of the patients subsequently required intensive care and mechanical air conditioning.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and the kidneys, may also be infected among these serious patients, often accompanied by cytological storms, which may be fatal among those with low immune function.
The virus was first separated from an open pulmonary pulmonary check-up of a relative from the source of the patient who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been working on HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 separated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent among young children, the elderly and people suffering from immune damage from respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCOV-NL63, nostrils, meningitis, fever and bronchitis are common.
Another independent study showed that the same virus was separated from the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is in fact distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is related to obstructing larynx, also known as Grub.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong due to pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to community access to pulmonary and bronchitis, HCOV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 has been found worldwide and can cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four communities have been well adapted to humans, and are often unlikely to undergo mutation leading to high-pathogenic diseases. But there are also accidents and unknown causes, such as one of the more toxic and rare subtypes of HCOV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Normally, these HCOVs also reduce their toxicity or pathogenicity when they acquire the ability to effectively transmit and sustain in humans.
MERS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old victim of acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although the majority of laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases are reported in countries in Europe and Tunisia, with occasional subsequent transmission to persons in close contact.
In 2015, a further outbreak of secondary transmission occurred in Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical performance of MERS is similar to SARS and is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also experienced acute renal failure, a characteristic unique to MERS in the disease caused so far by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases had been reported, with a high mortality rate of 34.4 per cent, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to mankind.
Accumulative pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in mid-December 2019, and a retrospective analysis confirmed its association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization declared the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases had been diagnosed globally, with a crude death rate of 3.4 per cent.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate is 4.2 per cent in Lake North, China, and 1.2 per cent outside the North.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can lead to severe respiratory infections in the form of heat, cough and respiratory difficulties.
Diarrhoea also occurs in some cases.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are clustered into different branches in system growth trees.
Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic but more contagious.
The reported emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an asymptomatic infection may accelerate the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other six types of HCOV, we can find very interesting similarities and differences.
First of all, the lurch of HCOV disease is very similar to the duration of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend of the other six HCOVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-COV and four communities with access to HCOV (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit more common features in community-accessible HCOV infections, including non-specific, mild and even symptomatic manifestations.
On the other hand, a small proportion of the serious COVID-19 cases are also found in SARS-CoV infections, although in a slightly lower proportion.
Third, the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 also shows the interesting patterns of community access to HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community access HCOV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2's transportability, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human generational transmission remains to be verified.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in excreta samples.
At least in some cases, it remains to be clarified whether the faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays as important a role as in SARS-CoV.
It is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community access HCOV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of transmission, pathogenicity and continuous transmission through the generations will have an important impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All 4 communities with mild symptoms have acquired HCOV well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, humans have been well adapted to these four types of HCOV.
In other words, both sides could be survivors of the ancient HCOV pandemic.
The HCOV, which causes serious diseases in humans, and the people who suffer from serious HCOV diseases, have died.
To this end, HCOV must be sufficiently replicated in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations to counter host limitation factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the greater the number of people infected, the greater the likelihood that it will be fully adapted to humankind.
If it is well adapted, its spread in humans will be difficult to stop through isolation or other control measures of infection.
Over the years, these four communities have received the spread of the coronary virus among the population, resulting in common influenza for those with normal immune functions.
These viruses don't need animal hosts.
In contrast, the high pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread in humans.
They need to survive and reproduce among common human and animal patients and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate and expanded hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community acquisition HCOV.
It is as highly contagious as community access HCOV, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community access to HCOV and less pathogenic than SARS-COV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and circulates within humans without host or middle animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCOV, the definition and characteristics of the evolution of HCOV as host, natural host, storage host, intermediate host and extended host have given us some guidance.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor of cogent at a high nucleic acid sequence level, it will become an evolutionary host of HCOV.
Ancestry viruses are usually adaptive and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, storage hosts also carry HCOV on a continuous basis over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host of HCOV or its parent viruses.
By contrast, HCOV would not be well adapted to the new host and would normally be pathogenic if it had just been placed in the intermediate host shortly after or immediately after.
Such intermediate hosts can serve as a source of human and animal co-infection and magnify the host by allowing the virus to be reproduced briefly and then transmitted to humans in order to increase the scale of the human infection.
If HCOV cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host, the end-of-life infection may occur.
On the contrary, HCOV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish long-term locality.
In such a case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reserve host.
A retrospective analysis of epidemiological data found that SARS indexed cases had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seropositive surveys showed higher levels of immunoglobin (IgG) resistance to SARS-CoV in animal vendors compared to the general population.
In the living animal market, the beaver and a beaver were first found carrying an almost identical SARS-CoV virus.
The fact that there were no further SARS reports after the removal of all beavers in the market indirectly supports this view.
However, reports indicate that the detection of SARS-CoV by farm beavers who are wild or not exposed to the market for living animals is largely negative, suggesting that the beaver may merely magnify the host in the middle rather than the natural host of SARS-COV.
It is worth noting that, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-COV antibodies, it cannot be excluded that a variety of small mammals may also be able to expand hostships among SARS-COVs.
All these animals seem to be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of the SARS-CoV natural animal host found a closely related bat coronary virus, known as SARS-related porcelain coronary virus HKU3 (SARRSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which survived in the cervix.
These bats are positive for the SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
The virus and other bat coronary viruses have 88-92% nucleic acid sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept of bats as hosts of emerging human pathogens.
In addition, researchers have identified various SARS coronary viruses (SL-CoVs) from bats, but no virus can be separated as a living virus except for a designated WIV1.
The human vascular strangulation conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the known receptor of SARS-CoV.
Experimental evidence has shown that the WIV1 extracted from the bat faeces sample uses bats, beavers and human ace2 as the receptor to the cells.
Interestingly, SARS' recovery serum can be middle and WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to the bat SARS-CoV, with 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Despite the high homogeneity of the two viruses, WIV1 is not generally considered to be a direct parent virus to SARS-COV, nor is bats a direct repository to SARS-COV.
System development analysis groups MERS-CoV in the same group as bats CoV-HKU4 and bats CoV-HKU5.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor diptosterase 4 (DPP4) to invade the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA Dependent RNA polymerase sequences are more closely associated with the system development of bats from Europe and Africa in beta-CoV.
So far, no living MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV has only 87% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with its close relative bat CoV-HKU25.
As a result, bats may not be directly stored by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that single-peak camels are sero-positive for MERS-CoV and antibodies, as are camels originating in the Middle East in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, which is separated from the noses of single-peak camels, is the same virus as the one found in the human body, which further shows that the camels are the true repositories of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in the camels with experimental infection MERS-CoV, the general symptoms were slight, but a large number of viruses were observed to fall.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the faecal route, which is also the main route through which the bats transmit the virus.
Problems persist, however, as many of the cases diagnosed by MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which may be attributable to human or unknown modes of transmission, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity with bats separated from the pyre.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are too large to establish filiation.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronary virus is found in the future, bats may not be the direct repository of SARS-CoV-2.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be associated with many of the original COVID-19 cases of wildlife species sold and slaughtered at the South China Sea Wholesale Market, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission events.
Several recent studies based on macrogenomic sequencing have shown that a small, endangered mammal, known as the moor-piercing, may also carry the ancestor beta-coV-2 associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new mountain-piercing coronary virus genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are equally close to RatG13, with about 90% homogeneity at nucleotide sequence levels.
In system growth trees, they are classified as two SARS-CoV-2 sample viruses subsystems, one of which has a more similar receptor combination (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acid sequence homogeneity.
In contrast, RSS-CoV-2 and RTT13 differ even more, although the sequence homogeneity of both genomes is higher.
An earlier study of disease punctures also reported the detection of virus overlaps from lung samples, with similar results for SARS-CoV-2.
Using different assembly methods and manual processing, the study obtained some genome sequences of about 86.3 per cent of the entire genome of the virus.
We can't rule out the possibility of being one of the middle animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-COV-2 is directly derived from the cross-barrel, as there is a difference in the beta-Cov-2 sequence associated with the piercing of the arc SARS-COV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-2 associated with the piercing of arc SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathways in bats, punctures and other mammals are still to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homogeneity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and cross-barrel, SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 had the highest whole genome sequence homologue.
It can be highly assumed that the high similarities between the beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related RBDs are caused by the convergence of selective interfaces.
Another contrary view is that the puncture-coV-2 associated beta-coV and RatG13 are reorganized in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force of evolution, reorganization is widespread in beta-CoV.
The origins of SARS-CoV-2 ' s direct human and animal diseases are not yet known.
In addition to the high pathogenic HCOV, the researchers studied the origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1.
Systematic developmental evidence suggests that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may have originated from bat coronary viruses, while the progeny of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
A bat coronary virus known as ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three-colour bats in North America was reported to be closely related to HCOV-NL63.
HCOV-229E, on the other hand, has a genetic link with another bat-caw virus found in Ghana (known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008), in which camels are suspected to be host.
For the sake of clarity, figures 1 and 2 summarize existing knowledge of known animal origins of HCOV.
Systematic development analysis provides evidence of historical inter-species transmission events in HCOV.
Around 1890, when HCOV-OC43 infected humans from cross-species livestock, there was an epidemic of respiratory infectious diseases.
The history of inter-ethnic transmission of HCOV-229E is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoV, closely related to HCOV-229E, has been discovered.
Between the two, there was a walrus of alpha-CoV.
Several pieces of evidence support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, rather than camels, may come into contact with bats in a common ecological position.
On the contrary, humans are in close contact with camels.
Second, the bat alpha-CoV associated with HCOV-229E is diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the camel alpha-CoV causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no walrus α-CoV was found in wildlife.
Therefore, it cannot be excluded that camels can obtain HCOV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipa and Hendra.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats transmit HCOV-229E directly to humans.
Or, even though bat alpha-CoV serves as a gene bank for HcoV-229E, the camels and monocromes may be the intermediate hosts of the virus to humans, exactly the same as the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the spread of different species, from bats to single-peak camels and from single-peak camels to humans.
The origins of the evolution of the bat's MERS-CoV were known in its initial identification and later discovered reinforced this argument.
It is clear that bats provide a rich reservoir of virus species for inter-species exchange and inter-species transmission.
Long-lived and dense groups, close social interaction and strong flight capacity are all favourable conditions for bats to become ideal “viral communicators”.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in single-peak camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and the camels have been transformed from intermediate hosts to stable natural depositors.
MERS-CoV causes very minor diseases in these animals and maintains a relatively low mutation rate.
Its sporadic spread to humans is an accident, and humans remain the end-owners of the MERS-CoV because of their inability to sustain it.
The role (if any) of cross-carriage in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different from that of camels in MERS-CoV transmission.
In particular, the piercing of bazooka-CoV is highly pathogenic in the piercing of the bazooka.
They may be the terminal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-CoV, similar to the beavers in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 inter-species transmission from animals to humans must be identified or excluded.
First, bats may be the hosts of the SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share ecological positions with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, it may be one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2's new invasion of the virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and eating wild food.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for an antibody survey of livestock and wildlife.
Thirdly, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may be restructured and adapted in the third species that have been exposed to bats and penetrating nails.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is continuing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors of the virus also play an important role in facilitating the crossing of interfamilial barriers by coronary viruses.
First, they have a high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is estimated to be between “medium” and “high”, with an average replacement rate of about 10-4 times per year per site, based on the adaptation phase of the coronary virus to the new host.
The elimination of coronary viruses, which have proof-readable nucleotide extratex enzymes, leads to very high variability and decay, or even to non-survival.
Interestingly, the known nuclear nucleotide similarity, Remdesivir, can suppress coronary virus replication by suppressing this nucleotide extratex enzyme and RNA dependent RNA polymerase.
Redeswell is one of the most promising anti-Sars-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of the coronary virus is about 1 million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, if the coronary virus is not well adapted to the host, the mutation rate is usually high.
The SARS-COV-2 mutation rate is significantly lower than that of SARS-COV, which has a high mutation rate, indicating that it is more adaptive to humans.
It can be assumed that it has adapted to another host that is close to humanity.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-peak camels.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to lead to the rapid neutralization of vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome of the coronary virus has added plasticity to the modifier of mutation and reorganisation of genes, thus increasing the potential for inter-synthetic evolution, which facilitates the emergence of new coronary viruses when appropriate.
Evidence of this is provided by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions directed towards end-coding of the genome 3'.
Third, the coronary virus changes the template randomly and frequently through a unique " copy selection " mechanism during the RNA replication process.
The chain exchange takes place frequently during the CoV RNA transfer process in the host of the mixed container.
A high homogeneity of the whole length and subgene of RNA can be reorganized to produce a new coronary virus.
Systematic developmental evidence of natural restructuring was found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronary viruses such as bats SL-COV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-host interactions
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
The reorganization of SARS-CoV is a typical example of evidence of positive selection in inter-septic transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of separate strains of humans and beavers SARS-COV, researchers believe that SARS-COV can quickly adapt to different hosts, particularly through mutation of S-protein RBD.
Normally, the RBD in the coronary virus S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is closely screened by the host's antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in S1 Sessions 318 to 510 amino acids, which binds to people ACE2 and its coreceptors to allow the virus to enter.
RSS-CoV's RBD can identify the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, beavers, rats and beavers, so that the virus spreads between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues of separate strains of human and beaver viruses were observed in RBD, 4 of which were in the receptor base of interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of the beaver SARS-CoV may increase the affinity of fibrous protein interactions with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be vital to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S-protein S1 module is 30%, which means that the combination of S-protein and human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cryoscope study shows that the affinity of this combination is 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors were needed in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination.
Interestingly, HcoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCOV receptors, such as HCOV-229E ' s amino pinease N and HCOV-OC43 ' s 9-O-Acetylated saliva.
They may also explain why the above-mentioned coronary virus has successfully adapted to humans after spreading across species from animal hosts.
In addition to the cell receptor, the results of inter-historical HCOV transmission are also influenced by other host dependency and restrictive factors.
These host proteins, which differ between humans and natural HCOV hosts such as bats, single-peak camels and rodents, may constitute barriers to inter-species transmission.
HCOV can only succeed in inter-cropping by depriving the host of the dependency factor and breaking the host's constraints.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of the important field of viral-host interaction have yet to be identified and expressed.
An impartial whole genome screening of SARS-CoV-2 host dependency and limiting factors, using the latest CRISPR technology, may yield results.
The emergence of a new HCOV: Back to the original
The diversity of bat coronary viruses provides ample opportunity for the emergence of new HCOVs.
In this sense, Batcaw viruses serve as the gene bank of HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic reorganization are also drivers of HCOV evolution and two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coded genes may radically alter the form of the virus.
In SARS-CoV supported proteins, because of the separation of SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, they were found to be able to encode different ORF8 proteins, so that ORF8 was considered important for human adaptation.
At the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 missing nucleotide features of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains of viruses.
This loss divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered adaptive mutation to facilitate host conversion.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have been reconfigured with the alpha- and gamma-coV spectrum, where a large number of smaller reorganization areas were found in RNA dependent RNA polymerases.
Reorganization sites were also found in nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has experienced interspectral reorganization events, which took place in single-peak camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reorganizations were also observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV and other animal coronary viruses were reorganized in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that manual selection may lead to accidental changes in the genome of the virus, probably as a result of the reduction of selective pressures, such as the host immune system, to which the virus is exposed.
An example of these effects is the absence of dual nucleotide in the HCOV-229E prototype strain, which leads to the loss of the entire length of ORF4.
Although a complete ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOV-229E, the camel alpha-CoV shows the insertion of a single nucleotide, causing a mutation of the code.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new HCOV is also driven by the pressure of storage host selection.
After the bats were infected with the coronary virus, no or minor symptoms were detected, indicating mutual adaptation between the coronary virus and the bat.
From anatomy and physiology point of view, bats seem to be well adapted to coronary viruses.
For example, deficiencies in the activation of the bat-inflammation response have effectively reduced pathological changes caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, the natural anti-cell activity of bats is inhibited by the positive regulation of the inhibitive natural anti-cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main tissue compatibility complex category I molecules.
Moreover, the high-level active oxygen (ROS) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats can both inhibit the copying of the coronary virus and affect the calibration through the nucleic acid extraterrestrial enzyme, thus providing a selective pressure on the strain to become highly pathogenic when entering the new host.
More pathogenic coronary strains may also evolve through reorganization, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics to adapt to the host.
So it's not by chance that three new HCOVs have emerged in the last two decades.
The coronary virus does not cause illness or mild symptoms among the stored hosts, such as bats and camels.
They are massively replicated and do not cause a strong host immunization response.
That is why there are asymptomatic carriers and the causes of serious human infections.
Severe symptoms are due mainly to the excessive activation of the immune response and the cytological storm, the greater the immune response, the greater the pulmonary damage.
In contrast, in the case of an insymptomatic carrier, the immune response has been decoupled from the copy of the coronary virus.
The same strategy to de-link the immune response may play a positive role in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
Interferon reactions are particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, it should be useful to use an I-type interferon at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, there are deficiencies in the activation of NLRP3 in bats.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to suppress NLRP3 inflammation may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were generated.
Although it has been found that bats with 95% nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV are beta-coV, there is also a bat coronary virus with 96% nucleotide homologue with SARS-CoV-2.
Although beavers and other animals in the market have been found carrying the same virus as SARS-COV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 has not yet been identified.
It has been discovered that puncture through the bazooka-coV, apparently the same source as SARS-CoV-2, suggests that puncture through the bazooka may be one of the middle hosts, or that puncture through the bazooka-coV may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite remaining doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally manufactured.
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 brought the coronary virus back into focus.
Research on coronary viruses in bats and other animals has significantly changed our awareness of the origins of HCOV co-morbidity and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the exposure of humans to the beavers in the market, closing the wet market and killing the beavers can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, in view of the discovery of several spectrometers of bazooka-CoV, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the puncture should be removed from the wet cargo market in order to prevent co-morbidity.
However, further research remains to be done on whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through mountain-piercing and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in single-peak camels for a long time.
These camels are important vehicles and are the main source of meat, milk, leather and fur products for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as the Chinese wildlife market did to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to halt the recurrence of the outbreak of the MERS, a comprehensive initiative should be undertaken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
As we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, leading to an outbreak of disease.
Coronal diseases of humans and animals circulate in the wild environment.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronary diseases.
These animals have many opportunities for evolution and reorganization of coronary diseases, leading to new coronary viruses that are more easily transmitted and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wildlife should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have been on Earth for a long time.
They stay in their natural hosts until there is an opportunity to spill over.
Although bats have many characteristics conducive to the transmission of the virus, human exposure to bats and other wildlife species will be greatly reduced if people are educated to stay away from bats and other wildlife species.
In order to better understand the ecological state of the coronary virus and its natural host, continuous monitoring of mammals will be necessary and will prove very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral co-human and animal diseases is to keep humans away from the ecological position of the natural host of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing from the mystery of the origin of co-morbidity.
First of all, if bats transmit an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus through the nails, it makes sense to look at the circumstances under which bats and nails can share the same ecological position.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how human contact with bats is yet to be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acted as a true intermediate host, it must be made clear how it interacted with different species, including humans, bats and punctures.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, are likely to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection studies should be carried out.
In the case of bats, nails or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical intergenerational viruses are expected to be found in natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
Need to update the diagnostic criteria for “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team released the Guide to Rapid Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infections of the 2019 New Coronal Virus (2019-nCoV), through which we provided experience and lessons for the global response to the epidemic.
However, 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease and, based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are also being updated.
In the present letter, we have responded to one of the comments on the above-mentioned guidelines and have provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the latest programme of consultations of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China (seventh edition).
In December 2019, 2019, the new coronary virus (2019-nCoV), which has now been officially named 2019 coronary virus disease (COVID-19), was known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 coronary virus (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO (World Health Organization) listed COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To counter SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid recommendation guide, which was published online in the magazine Military Medical Research on February 2020.
Since its launch, it has attracted a wide range of attention.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease and, based on ongoing research and clinical practice, our knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are also being updated.
For example, the National Health Council of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published a total of seven editions of the COVID-19 Clinical Program between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have changed substantially.
Now, our guide has received comments from Zhou et al., who, based on their clinical experience, have proposed a simple scoring programme.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidance and valuable references to the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their proposals would also need to be updated in the light of the latest COVID-19 Clinical Programme (seventh version of the pilot) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), the diagnosis of suspected cases requires a combination of an epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis and, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, three clinical manifestations:
Epidemiological history: (1) traveled or lived in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas or in communities where there are reported cases of COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms; (2) had a history of contact with SARS-COV-2 infections (nuclear acid test positive); (3) had a history of contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities reported to have COVID-19 within 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms; (4) had a history of contact with accumulative confirmed cases (at a small scale within 2 weeks prior to the occurrence of the symptoms) with patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, such as home, office, school class, etc.
Clinical performance: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory tract; (2) visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or reduced number of white cells in the early onset of the disease and reduced number of lymphocytes.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases, and there is any of the following evidence of pathology or serology: (1) real-time PCR testing positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the sequence of the entire genome of the virus shows a high level of homogeneity with the known new coronary virus; (3) the special IgM antibodies and IgG anti-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or SARS-COV-2 special properties of IgG antibodies from the negative to the positive, or a drop in the recovery period of 4 times higher than the acute period.
As we can see, the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) added real-time PCR tests in respiratory or blood samples.
The fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) added blood samples to the pathology test; the seventh edition subsequently added serological evidence.
These changes were based on the continuing work of researchers to study the best nucleic acid test box for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory specimens, including blood collection, which increased the availability of different samples and provided evidence for the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies in the diagnostic criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that alerts us to atypical and anesthetic symptoms.
The flow chart of Zhou et al. should therefore be updated, as they classify persons with no clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
In addition, the scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we would like to see more direct evidence and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases”, we propose to refer to and follow the latest guidelines of the country in which the case is located.
Our team will also update our guide in time to help.
Five new cases of COVID-19 deaths were reported in Bangladesh, rising to an all-time high.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new cases of COVID-19 deaths on that day.
This created a new high of single-day deaths due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDR) had recorded 114 confirmed cases and 33 treated after home rest.
17 cumulative deaths.
At an online press conference, the head of IEDDR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, stated that these deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also indicated that two of the deceased were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global epidemic (pandemic).
A hospital official revealed to the local press, Anadolu Agency, that one of the deceased patients was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who had been treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridge of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, announced via online video that the stoppage of public transport would be extended beyond the original schedule until Saturday.
The public transport stoppage began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Essential goods, such as medical treatment, fuel and food, remain transportable.
On 8 March, two of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 recorded in Bangladesh returned from Italy, and one of the patients was the wife of one confirmed patient.
As of 19 March, all three patients had been rehabilitated.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than a million infections worldwide
Data from Johns Hopkins University show that the global total of SARS-CoV-2 coronary virus infections exceeded 1 million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths are related to coronary virus-induced diseases - COVID-19.
On the same day of the milestone, Malawi confirmed the first case of coronary virus infection in the country and the first case of coronary virus-related deaths in Zambia.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea declared that, by Thursday, it was one of the few countries with no coronary virus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) on 4 April, central European time.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary virus have been recorded, resulting in at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News quoted data from Johns Hopkins University that, on Wednesday, coronary viral infections killed more than 1,000 people in the United States.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the date of the siege to 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians throughout the country would continue to be paid until 30 April during the suspension of work.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew on Al-Quds Al-Mukarramah and Medina to a full-day curfew, which had previously been in effect only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the State had extended the Home Rule Order until 1 May.
Australian stores have reduced the maximum number of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia ' s chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the cap on the purchase of sanitary paper for each of their stores to two and one packs, respectively, throughout the country.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions are posted on the cashier's counter in the form of a message or on a Facebook page with a chain of stores.
It was reported that buyers were hoarding goods out of fear of COVID-19 in order to prevent them from being self-segregated.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also limits the purchase of toilet paper for delivery to a single package.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced restrictions on the purchase of four packages per transaction on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
In its press release of 8 March, Coles reported that, after the imposition of the four-pack limit, “many shops were still sold out within an hour of arrival”, and called the demand “unprecedented”, while AlDI called it “unforeseeable” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesman for Woolworths, sales last week were “a sharp increase”.
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the permitted number to two.
In order to further alleviate the shortfall, Coles ordered greater packaging from the supplier and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI pre-positioned stocks for the planned Wednesday benefits.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, stated that retailers tried to increase their stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times made this difficult.
He anticipated that, as suppliers tried to meet demand, production costs would increase and preferential activities would decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some shops would not be able to hold Wednesday special events.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at the University of Science and Technology, Queensland, stated that stores replenish stocks every night.
He said that sanitary paper was a large item and that, as a result, there were fewer stocks, and once sold out, it left huge shelf space, adding to the sense of material shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths argue that if there were a lot of things on the shelf, goods like roll paper and handwashing fluids could be [buyed] and in sufficient quantities, you might not panic that much.” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer Who Gives a Crap stated last Wednesday that they were no longer in stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures clean sanitary paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent sanitary paper, both emphasize that they are working all day and on weekends to secure supplies.
The real estate website Domain.com reports that a number of real estate vendors will provide free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, as buyers take a short weekend break and hold fewer auctions.
NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin City, contains eight pages of inserts in its Thursday edition, designed to be used as toilet paper after cropping.
According to ABC Australia, on 3 March, the store was initially reluctant to impose restrictions on purchases, which they said they did not plan to impose.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other commodities, including masks, hand-washing fluids, dry goods, hand-washing fluids and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado limits the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 2 packs, 12 volumes per package, on Sunday night.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 (diseases caused by the coronary virus SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
While the term “epidemiology” refers only to the extent of the spread of disease and not to the risk of a particular case, WHO notes the need to urge Governments to take measures:
“All countries/regions can still change the course of the epidemic.
If countries/regions respond by testing, testing, treating, segregating, tracking and mobilizing their people, the Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus, said.
“We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of proliferation and severity, as well as the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the pandemic was “unprecedented”.
In his comments at CNN in February, he said, “With the exception of influenza, no respiratory virus has been found to continue spreading around the globe after its emergence”.
Ghebreesus expressed a similar view and said, “We have never seen a major epidemic caused by a coronary virus before”.
He went on to say, “Same thing, we've never seen a controlled virus pandemic before”.
Before entering the new state of the pandemic, in January WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said that the outbreak, “most importantly, it is still deteriorating”.
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019-2020 The coronary virus epidemic is a continuing epidemic of 2019 new coronary disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was confirmed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and as an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and territories worldwide cumulatively reported approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases, with approximately 97,000 deaths,
Healing about 36.4 million people.
China has a morbidity rate of about 4 per cent, while the global rate ranges from 0.08 per cent (New Zealand) to 13.04 per cent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include heat, cough and gas.
It is also likely to be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc.
The lurking period from exposure to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
There are currently no vaccine or special antiviral treatment programmes.
The preventive measures recommended include manual washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining safe distance from others, surveillance and self-segregation of persons suspected of being infected.
Official agencies in various countries have responded to travel restrictions, segregation, curfews, dangerous workplace controls and facility closures.
The epidemic has led to severe socio-economic shocks across the globe, the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, and the exacerbation of panic shopping, which has exacerbated the widespread shortage of supplies.
Worldwide, 193 countries and territories have implemented national or local suspension measures, affecting some 99.4 per cent of primary, secondary and tertiary students.
Xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian descent and physical groups, as well as groups in regions with severe epidemics, have emerged as a result of the spread of false viral information online.
However, reduced mobility and heavy industry closures have led to lower air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health department of Wuhan (Hubei Province capital) in China reported an unknown number of cases of pneumonia and opened an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the wholesale fish market in the South China Sea, so the new coronary virus is considered to be a common disease.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus, closely related to bat-circumculatory, mountain-piercing, and SARS-Cov. The first patients were later confirmed to have an outbreak on 1 December 2019, with no apparent connection to the subsequent cases of the South China Sea Fish Market.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China Sea Fish Market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019, with 55-year-old males from Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported a decline in new reported cases in China, but a sudden and dramatic increase in new reported cases in Italy, Iran and Korea, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the territory for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially minor cases.
As of February 26, relatively few cases of adolescents were reported, with only 2.4 per cent of the world’s 19-year-olds and under. Patrick Valance, chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the United Kingdom’s population needed to be infected with a new coronary virus in order to achieve effective group immunization.
The number of cases is the number of persons who have been tested by COVID-19 and who have been identified as positive under official programmes.
As of March 23, the proportion of people tested in all countries of the world was no more than 3 per cent of the total population, and many countries had issued official policies for populations without detection of light diseases, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
According to a study published on 16 March, as of 23 January, an estimated 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections in China had not been detected, and the unrecorded infections were 79 per cent of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the actual number of infections in Italy was far higher than the number of reported cases.
The basic transmission of COVID-19 (R0) was initially estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control in the United States showed that R0 could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients can recover.
The period between the onset of the disease and the death of those who cannot recover is 6-41 days, 14 days most common.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 people died in COVID-19.
As of 5 February, about 80% of deaths in China were among persons over 60 years of age, and 75% of deaths were accompanied by both cardiovascular diseases and basic diseases such as diabetes. Official statistics on COVID-19 deaths usually refer to deaths with positive results of new coronary virus testing under official programs.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths is likely to be much higher than the statistics, as it may not include untested patients, such as those who died in their homes, sanatoriums, etc.
Part of the data from Italy shows that the actual number of deaths during the epidemic is four to five times the number of deaths from new coronary virus pneumonia in official statistics.
A woman spokesman for the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) said, “We know that [the declared death toll] is lower than actual,” and rumours that US data are underestimated confirm this statement. Underestimation is a frequent occurrence in the epidemiological field, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first deaths outside China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February and the first outside Asia in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, there were more than a dozen deaths outside China, each in Iran, the Republic of Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, over 40 countries and territories on all continents, except Antarctica, reported deaths. Several methods are often used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the time of the first outbreak, and age, gender and overall health.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of April 10, 2020 was 6.0 per cent (97,039,1,617,204).
Mortality rates vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated morbidity rate fell from 17.3 per cent (1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (1 February 2020 and 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the number of confirmed deaths, and disease deaths as a percentage of those infected (including confirmed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow the entire process from infection to case resolution of a particular population.
Many scholars have tried to calculate the above data for specific groups of people.
The evidence-based medical centre at Oxford University estimates the overall infection mortality rate of the epidemic to be between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper limit of the estimate for this range is in line with the first random test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis study of the effects of the detection on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that the epidemic is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak could not be determined and varied from region to region.
Maciej Boni, from the State University of Pennsylvania, stated: “If not controlled, outbreaks of infectious diseases usually enter a standstill period when the existing host is depleted, and then begin to ease.
But at this point it is almost impossible for us to reasonably predict when the turning point will appear.”
China's Senior Medical Adviser, Chung Namshan, believes that “the end of the epidemic in June can be expected if all countries mobilize to adopt the recommendations of the World Health Organization on measures to halt the spread of the virus”.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 “could explode repeatedly for a period of one to two years”.
A study led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology showed that it is essential to take physical distance and other measures “before the vaccine becomes operational (which may take 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from Vanderberg University said, “This coronary virus is highly contagious, and I think it's unlikely to disappear completely”, and “may evolve into a seasonal disease, with an annual outbreak.”
Re-emerging virulence depends on the level of mass immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some of the infected may be unsymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory tungsten (thin), loss of smell, aerolysis, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, cold, vomiting, cretin, diarrhoea, or hysteria. According to the World Health Organization, about one in six patients turns to severe illness and suffers from respiratory difficulties.
The Center for Disease Control in the United States (CDC) lists respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden confusion, difficulty of abstinence and bruises on the face or lip as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical treatment is recommended. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock and death.
Some of the infected may be unsymptomatic and have no clinical manifestations, but the results are positive, so researchers recommend close observation and examination of the close contact of the diagnosed patient to exclude the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the rate of unsymptomatic infections varies from extremely low to 44 per cent.
The lurking period (between the time of infection and the onset of the disease) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days is the most common. With regard to uncertainty, one example can be found: the rate of loss of smell among COVID-19 patients was initially estimated at 30 per cent, and then decreased to 15 per cent.
Some details on the path of transmission of the disease have yet to be determined.
The disease is currently thought to be transmitted mainly through close contact, as well as by fly-foam from coughing, sneezing or speaking; proximity contact is within a interval of 1-2 metres (3-6 feet).
The study found that unshielded cough could lead to the most distant transmission of 4.5 m (15 feet)-8.2 m (15-27 feet).
It has also been suggested that a longer stay in the air as people speak can also lead to the spread of the virus. Although the virus usually cannot be transmitted through the air, it can also occur when people breathe or speak.
It may fall on the mouth and nose of the people around it and even be inhaled into the lungs.
Medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may cause haemorrhage in the respiratory tract and, in turn, air transport.
In addition, if a person touches the surface (including the skin) contaminated by the virus and then touches the mouth of his or her eyes and nose, it may also cause the virus to spread.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through excreta, but this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 manure transmission. The virus is most contagious three days before the onset of the disease, but also before and after the onset of the disease.
Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset of the disease, indicating that the new coronary virus was contagious before the symptoms became apparent.
Although there have been very few reported cases of asymptomatic cases diagnosed in laboratories, some countries have detected cases of asymptomatic infections in the course of follow-up investigations by contact persons.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that, although the spread of the new coronary virus is not yet entirely clear, it is generally transmitted by one person to two or three people. The lifetime of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, new coronary viruses are known to survive on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
However, its lifetime is also influenced by humidity and temperature. There are now positive cases of pets and other animals COVID-19.
There is currently no evidence that animals will retransfect the virus to humans, but official British agencies recommend that people wash their hands after exposure to animals, as if they had been exposed to the surfaces of other people who may have been exposed.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) type 2 is a new virus, first separated from 3 patients of pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus. Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with home soap, because the soap dissolves the virus's protective cylindrical. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
At present, it is considered to be a common disease of humans and animals.
Genetic analysis shows that this coronary virus is genetically associated with the beta coronary virus in a cluster of the Sarbecovirus sub-beans and two bat-origin strains.
The new coronary virus and other bat coronary virus samples (BatCov RatG13) are 96% consistent with the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that only one amino acid was missing from some parts of the genome sequence of the virus in the hysteria and the virus in the human body.
To date, total genome comparisons have found that a maximum of 92 per cent of genetic material is the same between the mountain-piercing coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2 and that it is not sufficient to prove that the cross-carriage is the intermediate host.
The initial diagnosis of whether the virus is infected can be based on symptoms, but ultimately can be determined only by reversion of the polymer-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretion.
A comparison of PCR and CT studies in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and that many imaging features overlap with other pneumococcal and disease development processes.
As of March 2020, the ARS recommended that “CT is not suitable for screening COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease”.
The World Health Organization has now published several nucleic acid testing programmes for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
Nucleic acid testing involves a real-time reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for detection.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, the test is carried out by snorting and also by swabs. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests for antibody testing.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests had been confirmed as sufficiently accurate to allow widespread use.
In the United States, serology tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use by certified laboratories only in emergency situations.
The typical imaging features of the patient ' s X fragments and computer fault scans (CTs) include external grinding glass shadow asymmetric and chestless cavity fluids.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international online database on the image performance of confirmed cases.
The uniqueness of images not confirmed by the PCR in the identification of COVID-19 is limited by overlap with other viral infections (e.g. gland virus).
A major study in China, comparing the results of breast CT with those of PCR, found that although images were less specific to the identification of infection, detection was faster and more sensitive and could therefore be considered as a means of screening in endemic areas.
An artificial intelligence-based curly neural network has been developed that combines X tablets and CT to detect the image features of the virus.
Measures to prevent the spread of the disease include good hygiene practices, manual washing, avoidance of unwashed contact with the mouth of the eye and nose, coughing or sneezing, covering of the mouth and nose with paper towels, which are thrown directly into the trash.
A suspected infected person should wear a medical surgical mask when entering a public place.
It is also recommended that measures be taken to maintain physical distance in order to prevent the spread of the virus.
However, the virus has now reached the stage of community transmission in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, with some community residents having no idea where or how they are infected.
The Government ' s use of mobile positioning data for tracing purposes raised privacy concerns, and over 100 organizations, such as Amnesty International, issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications are currently in use or in-access proposals for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection functions, such as the use of bluetooth to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
Users receive alerts once they have been in close contact with patients who have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It is recommended that the spread of the disease be stopped through manual washing.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and tap water at least 20 seconds on a regular basis, especially in the back of a toilet or when there is a visible stain on their hands, before meals and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because the virus, before entering the human body, uses domestic soap to destroy its protective cylindrical, thereby killing the virus.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends the use of alcohol-containing hand-washing fluids of at least 60% if there is no soap and running water around it.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
The surface of the object can be sterilized with a variety of solutions (the disinfection is effective within one minute of the stainless steel surface action), including 62-71 per cent ethanol, 50-100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochloride, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5 per cent polyketone iodine.
Other solutions (e.g., benzachlor ammonium and glucose acid) were less effective.
The U.S. CDC recommends disinfection of all regions, including offices, ablutions, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablet computers, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and patient-used ATMs, if new coronary pneumonia cases or confirmed cases occur in facilities such as offices or day-care centres.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with bending elbows or paper towels while coughing or sneezing, and immediately dispose of all contaminated paper towels.
Persons suspected of being infected are advised to wear a medical surgical mask, as wearing a mask can reduce the amount of fumes and the distance of transmission when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued a note on the circumstances and methods of use of masks.
The University of Leeds virologist Stephen Griffin argued that “the wearing of a mask reduces the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is also a major source of infection in the absence of adequate manual hygiene.” In addition, it was suggested that the person responsible for caring for suspected infections should wear a mask.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that masks be worn by healthy populations only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for the patients of COVID-19, although the organization also recognized that masks helped to avoid face-touching.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The U.S. CDC recommends non-medical masks made of fabric. China, for its part, explicitly recommends that healthy citizens wear a one-time medical mask, especially when they are in close contact with others within 1 metre (3 feet).
Hong Kong, China, recommends the wearing of masks for public transport or for access to crowd-intensive sites.
Thai health officials recommend that people make their own masks and wash them on a daily basis.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, access to public places is strictly prohibited without masks or masks.
On March 16, Viet Nam demanded that all persons wear masks to enter public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government requires all persons to enter the grocery store with masks.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, China, has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, starting on April 1, requiring that masks be worn in trains and inter-city buses.
Panama made it mandatory to leave the country with masks, and recommended that residents who could not afford masks make their own masks.
The masks are also widely used in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Measures to prevent and control infection by maintaining social distance (also referred to as physical distance) are aimed at minimizing close human-to-person contact, thereby slowing the spread of the disease.
Measures include segregation; travel restrictions; suspension, suspension and closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
Measures that individuals can take to maintain social distance include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas, changing to non-contact forms of greeting and physical distance with others.
Many Governments have now imposed or advised social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
With regard to the largest concentration of people, the United States Government agencies and WHO initially proposed 250 people (in areas where no COVID-19 transmission took place), which was quickly reduced to 50 and later to 10.
In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance” to clarify that the aim was to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact, including virtual and long-distance contacts.
The use of the term “staying social distance” implies a requirement of complete social isolation and does not encourage other ways of maintaining people-to-people links. Some authorities have also issued sexual health guidelines that apply during the pandemic.
The recommendations included sexual relations with a partner who lived with only one person who was not infected with the virus or had no symptoms.
COVID-19 is recommended for self-segregation in the home of diagnosed patients and suspected infected persons.
Health institutions have issued detailed information on proper self-segregation.
The strictest self-segregation instructions were also issued to high-risk populations.
If it is possible to have been exposed to the COVID-19 patient, or have recently been to a widely transmitted country or region, it is recommended that self-segregate for 14 days from the time of eventual exposure to the virus.
Epidemic control strategies include containment/constraint and mitigation.
The containment applies to the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and segregating the infected, together with other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
If the spread of the disease is no longer contained, efforts should be made to make the transition to a mitigation phase: measures should be taken to slow the spread of the disease and reduce its impact on health systems and society.
Both containment and mitigation measures could take place simultaneously.
Sterilization requires more extreme prevention and control measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic regeneration to below 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak is to try to reduce the epidemic’s peak, the levelling of the epidemiological curve that we know.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health service systems and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatment programmes.
Non-pharmacological interventions that can contain the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, masking and self-segregation; community measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as suspension of schools and the cancellation of mass gatherings; community action to encourage acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning. In the face of a significantly increased epidemic, China immediately adopted stricter containment measures, such as the closure of cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries and regions have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
The Republic of Korea introduced large-scale screening and local isolation measures and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support for self-segregated infections and imposed huge fines on those who rejected self-segregated infections.
Taiwan, China, increased its mask production, and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical supplies sold at its expense. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States showed that both easing (but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and containing (reverse the spread of the epidemic) faced major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health needs by two thirds and reduce the number of deaths by half, but they may still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Sterilization may be the preferred measure, but it needs to be maintained until the virus ceases to spread among the population (or until the vaccine is introduced, whichever comes first), otherwise the spread will rebound quickly once the measure is relaxed.
Long-term interventions aimed at containing the pandemic have social and economic costs.
No special antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but research and development is under way, including testing of existing drugs.
The use of non-prescriptive cold drugs, rehydration and rest may help to alleviate symptoms.
Aerobics, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required depending on the severity of the condition.
The use of steroids may lead to a deterioration of the situation.
A number of compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied to determine their suitability for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also noted that some “traditional and family therapy” can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that improving processing capacity and adapting the medical system to meet the needs of the COVID-19 patients is a basic response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospital and primary health-care services, which are used to transfer resources at multiple levels, including concentrating laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating selective procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capacity through training of personnel and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There is a great deal of speculation about the origin of the first case (so-called patient zero).
The first known case of new coronary virus pneumonia may date back to 1 December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of new coronary virus cases in Hubei Province gradually increased.
Most of these patients are related to the South China Sea Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, a theory that the new coronary virus originates in one of these animals; or, in other words, in humans and animals. On December 26, Zhang, a doctor at the Midwest Medical Complex in Hubei Province, first discovered and treated an unknown number of pneumonia patients, and reported to the disease prevention and control centre in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a “Sars-like coronary virus”.
Eight doctors, including Lee Wen-Lung, were reprimanded by the police for spreading “monsters”, while another doctor, Eiffen, was reprimanded by his superiors for sounding the alarm.
The Wuhan City Health Council subsequently issued an announcement on 31 December and reported to the World Health Organization.
An investigation was launched in early January, following numerous reports of cases of undisclosed pneumonia in the Wuhan health sector. Early in the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
Between the beginning of January and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China as a result of the massive population movement of the Chinese Spring Festival and the use of Wuhan as a traffic and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including 2 in Beijing and 1 in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people showed symptoms as of January 20, 2020. As of March 26, more cases were diagnosed in the United States than in China and Italy, making it the country with the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million confirmed cases were reported globally; 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 cured.
Some 200 countries and territories around the world reported confirmed cases.
As a result of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have adopted preventive measures that restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.
National responses include containment, such as isolation (also referred to as home orders, local asylum orders, or closures) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90 per cent of the total population, were in some form of blockade, more than 50 million people in the Philippines were in a blockade, 59 million people in South Africa were in a blockade, and 1.3 billion people in India were in a blockade.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of blockade, rising to 2.6 billion in two days, or about one third of the global population.
The first example is the confirmed case of COVID-19, which dates back to 1 December 2019 and is located in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report assumes that the earliest cases date back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang discovered an unknown number of cases of pneumonia on 26 December, and his hospital reported the situation to the disease prevention and control centre in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, on 27 December.
On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronary viruses was found in preliminary genetic tests of patient samples.
On December 31, the Wuhan City Health and Health Board issued a public announcement that:
Reported to the World Health Organization on the same day.
Following these circulars, several doctors in the city of Wuhan were reprimanded by the police for having been subjected to a walk-in outbreak “false rumour”.
The National Health Council of China initially claimed that there was no “clarified evidence” of the human being.
Later in the month, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign, which was later described by Central Secretary Xi Jinping as a “people's war” to curb the spread of the virus.
On 23 January, the Government announced the launch of a quarantine line in Vuhanla, prohibiting access to Wuhan, which was later extended to 15 other cities north of the lake, affecting a total of some 57 million people, which is known as the “largest isolated incident in human history”.
The use of private cars in the city is prohibited.
The celebration of the Chinese New Year of Agriculture (January 25) was also cancelled in many places.
The Government also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Mt. Fire, which was completed and made operational within 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, the Mt. Thor, was constructed to receive more patients.
In addition to the construction of new hospitals, China has transformed 14 other places in Wuhan, such as the Convention Centre and the stadium, into a flat hospital. On January 26, the government took further steps to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health declarations to travellers and extended spring holidays.
National institutions of higher education and primary and secondary schools have also been completely suspended.
A number of measures have also been taken in Hong Kong, China, and Macao, Macao, particularly for primary and secondary schools and higher education.
In China, remote home-based office measures have been implemented in many parts of the country.
In addition to Hubei Province, travel restrictions have been imposed on other identities.
Public transport has been adjusted and museums throughout China are temporarily closed.
In many cities, public facilities are regulated, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) are restricted by some form of outdoor activity.3 After the epidemic entered the global stage in the month, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being “inbound” from other countries and regions.
Beijing, for example, imposed a 14-day period of compulsory isolation on all people entering Kyoto abroad. In the five days prior to March 23, there was only one indigenous case in mainland China, which was transmitted by a traveller returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of indigenous cases had been largely halted and that the Chinese epidemic had been brought under control.
On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits would be suspended as of March 28, with no details as to when this policy will end.
Persons wishing to enter China are required to apply for visas from Chinese embassies or consulates.
The State Council announced April 4 as the National Day of Condolence, and launched a three-minute national memorial on that day at 10:00. This day coincides with Ching Ming, where the central government advocated that families mourn the passing of their loved ones through the network in order to maintain physical distance and avoid a second outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.
On January 20, 2020, there was a confirmed case of COVID-19 in Korea.
The Korea Health Agency reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases on February 20, mainly as a result of a new religious movement gathering in Daegu, Korea, the Church of Jesus of New Heaven.
The newcomers from Wuhan to Daegu are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13%, reported symptoms. Korea announced its top security level on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, Korea cumulatively reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, increasing to 3,150 on 29 February.
A virus test of three soldiers confirmed positive, after which all Korean military bases were isolated.
The schedule of flights has also been adjusted by the impact of the epidemic. South Korea has introduced what is considered to be the largest and best organized virus-control program in the world, which is to screen large numbers of people for viruses, isolate all those infected, and track and isolate those infected in close contact.
Screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new entrants from outside the country through mobile applications for free virus testing, with results obtained the following day, while increasing detection capacity to accommodate up to 20,000 people per day.
Despite the fact that the city was not isolated, South Korea’s plan was considered a success in the prevention and control of the epidemic. South Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude to the Presidential response to the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire.
Many Koreans signed the petition, some calling for impeachment, accusing the Government of mishandling the epidemic, and others commending his strategy.
On 23 March, it was reported that Korea had seen its lowest single-day total of new cases since the beginning of the four-week period.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all new arrivals abroad would be isolated for two weeks.
On 1 April, the media reported that the Republic of Korea had received requests for assistance in the detection of viruses from 121 different countries and territories.
On 19 February, Iran announced the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Qom, and later, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health, the two patients died that same day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the total suspension of universities, higher education institutions and primary and secondary schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed that there were no plans to block the areas affected by the epidemic, but only to isolate the infected individuals.
In March, Iran announced plans to restrict inter-city travel, but inter-city traffic congestion continued into the Persian New Year.
Shia holy places in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. In February, Iran became a post-China viral transmission centre.
The extent of the outbreak of the disease in Iran was perceived by many to have been overshadowed, including the fact that, as of 28 February, cases in more than a dozen countries had been traced to Iran, thus indicating that the actual outbreak in Iran was more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Government as of that date.
The Iranian parliament was forced to close and 23 of its 290 members reportedly found positive on 3 March.
On 12 March, HRW urged Iranian prisons to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peacefully expressing dissent and to release provisionally all eligible prisoners.
It noted that the risk of transmission of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, is greater and that these institutions lack adequate health-care measures.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest single-day number of deaths reported in the country since the outbreak.
As of 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 additional confirmed cases per hour, with 1 new case of coronary virus death every 10 minutes.
According to World Health Organization officials, the actual number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than reported.
The view was also expressed that United States sanctions against Iran could affect the country ' s financial capacity to respond to the epidemic.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the easing of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, two Chinese tourists were detected in Rome as positive and the epidemic was confirmed to have spread to Italy.
The subsequent sharp rise in the number of cases in the country prompted the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
Beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardi on February 21, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was discovered. On February 22, the Cabinet of Ministers announced a new decree to curb the spread of the epidemic, including the isolation of more than 50,000 people in 11 different cities in northern Italy.
The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conté, declared that “it is strictly forbidden to enter or leave the area.
The epidemic area has ordered a suspension of work and sports events.” On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered a total suspension of schools at all levels throughout the country, as the number of deaths in the country reached 100.
All major sports events, including the Italian Football A League, were held in a non-Audience mode until April, but on March 9, all sports events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Gunter ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian Institute of Anaesthetic Stress Medicine (SIAARTI) published a medical ethics proposal for a possible referral programme.
On 19 March, Italy reported 3,405 deaths from the pandemic, thus exceeding China, making it the country with the highest number of deaths from the new global coronary virus.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had dispatched nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Italy amounted to 128,948, deaths 15,887, and cure 21,815, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
Cable News in the United States has reported that the large elderly population in Italy and the two factors that have so far been unable to detect all infections of the virus may be part of the cause of the high mortality rate.
Britain’s initial response to the virus was considered to be one of the most lax in the affected countries. It was not until March 18, 2020 that the British government began implementing various forms of social distance-keeping or large-scale isolation measures against its citizens.
As a result, the British government has been criticized for its lack of speed and strength in responding to public concerns. On March 16, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending the cancellation of any non-necessary travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work at home as far as possible and avoid going to bars, restaurants, theatres, etc.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure places, including bars and gymnasiums, should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay up to 80% of workers up to a monthly ceiling of £2,500 in order to prevent unemployment in crisis. On March 23, the British Prime Minister announced more stringent measures to keep social distance, prohibiting assemblies of more than two persons, and not to carry out any travel or outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the announced restrictions were enforced by the police by means of fines and dispersing assemblies.
With the exception of supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and garages, which have been identified as “essential”, most of the other operations have been suspended.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was discovered in the state of Washington, North-West Pacific, on January 20, and the patient returned from Wuhan on January 15.
On 29 January, the White House set up a Task Force on Crown Virus.
On 31 January, the Trump Government declared a state of public health emergency and imposed immigration restrictions on travellers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the U.S. Center for Disease Control (the leading public health agency under the U.S. Government) announced that it had developed its own test kits.
Nevertheless, the United States was still slow to begin testing, concealing the true state of the epidemic at the time.
The Federal Government produced a defective reagent box in February, which was only approved by the Federal Government at the end of February for use (from academia, companies and hospitals) and the restrictive test eligibility criteria (after which medical advice was required) only at the beginning of March, all of which led to the obstruction of pre-testing in the United States.
On 27 February, the Washington Post reported that the total number of tests carried out in the United States was less than 4,000.
On 13 March, the Atlantic newspaper reported that the total number of tests carried out in the United States was less than 14,000.
March 22, Associated Press reported: “Many patients with symptoms and medical instructions waited hours or days to be tested.” On February 29, when Washington State reported the first death in the United States, Governor Jay Insley declared a state of emergency and other states followed suit.
On March 3, Seattle regional schools were suspended. In mid-March, schools at all levels of the country were completely cut off. On March 6, 2020, some epidemiologists at the Imperial College of London made predictions about the impact of the new coronary virus on the United States.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronal Virus Prevention and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided federal agencies with $8.3 billion in emergency funding to respond to the epidemic.
Enterprises impose travel restrictions on staff, cancel meetings and encourage staff to work at home.
Sports events and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced a 30-day travel ban on most European countries, with the exception of the United Kingdom, from March 13.
The following day, Trump extended the restrictions to include the United Kingdom and Ireland.
On 13 March, Trump declared a state of emergency and began to use federal funds to respond to the crisis.
Since March 15, many businesses across the United States have closed down or reduced business hours with a view to mitigating the spread of the virus.
As of 17 March, confirmed cases had been reported in 50 states across the United States and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that the number of confirmed cases of the new coronary virus in New York City was 10,700, exceeding the total number of cases in Korea.
On 25 March, the Governor of the State of New York stated that maintaining social distance seemed to have started to work, with a doubling of the value of cases from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in New York City stood at 32,308, with 672 deaths due to the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the number of confirmed new coronary virus infections in the United States was higher than in any other country, including China and Italy. As of April 8, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States was 400,335 and 12,841.
According to a media report on March 30, the President of the United States, Trump, decided to extend the implementation of the social distance guidelines until April 30.
On the same day, the Concomfort medical ship, with a total of about 1,000 beds, broke down in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded a record 884 new coronary virus deaths within 24 hours.
On April 3, the total number of cases in the state of New York was more than 100,000. The White House’s instructions to health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the Office of Vice President Mike Pence, as a means of diluting threats and controlling the transmission of information, were criticized by the public.
The general acceptance of the Trump crisis prevention measures has been polarized by partisan differences.
A number of United States officials and commentators criticized the reliance of the United States on the import of essential goods, such as essential medical supplies, from China.
Air travel model analysis was used to map and predict dissemination patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
According to information released by the International Air Transport Association in 2018, the largest number of passengers travel from Wuhan to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne are also reported to be hot destinations for travellers from Wuhan.
Of the 20 most popular destination cities, Bali is reported to be the worst-prepared and Australian cities the best-prepared. Australia released its new coronary virus (COVID-19) contingency plan on 7 February.
The report notes that the knowledge of COVID-19 is not sufficiently advanced and that Australia will focus on border control and communication in its response to the epidemic.
On March 21, Australia declared a “State of Emergency for Human Biosafety”.
As a result of the effective isolation of public transport in Wuhan and other areas north of the lake, a number of countries and regions have plans to repatriate their citizens and diplomats living in those areas, mainly through national charter flights and with permission from the relevant Chinese authorities.
Among the first countries to plan for evacuation were Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand.
Pakistan has indicated that it will not withdraw its population from China.
On 7 February, Brazil withdrew 34 Brazilians or family members, as well as 4 Poles, 1 Chinese and 1 Indian.
Brazilian aircraft pass through Poland and make a short stop prior to their flight to Brazil, where Polish, Chinese and Indian citizens disembarked.
Brazilian citizens who had travelled to Wuhan were taken to a military base near Brasilia to be isolated.
On the same day, 215 Canadians (of whom 176 were withdrawn by the first aircraft and 39 by the second aircraft chartered by the United States Government) withdrew from Wuhan and were sent to the Trentongar military base for a period of two weeks of isolation.
On 11 February, another aircraft carrying 185 Canadians took off from Wuhan and landed at the Trentongar military base.
On 3 and 4 February, the Australian authorities withdrew 277 citizens and sent them to the Christmas Island detention centre, which had been converted to a place of isolation, for a period of 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation aircraft landed in Auckland on 5 February; passengers on board, including some from Australia and the Pacific, were taken to a naval base north of Auckland for isolation.
On February 15, the United States announced the withdrawal of Americans on the diamond Princess.
On 21 February, an aircraft carrying 129 Canadian passengers landed in Trenton, Ontario, and these passengers were withdrawn from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Government of India began withdrawing its population from Iran, and on March 14, the South African Government chartered a South African Airlines aircraft to withdraw 112 South African citizens.
The flight was preceded by a medical screening of passengers, and four South Africans, who showed signs of a new coronary virus, were left behind to reduce the risk of transmission.
Only South Africans with negative results were withdrawn.
All South Africans (including crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in humanitarian missions) tested negative results and, as a precautionary measure, were sent to The Ranch Resort for 14 days of observation and isolation.
On March 20, as a result of the epidemic, the United States began to withdraw some of its troops from Iraq.
On 5 February, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China indicated that 21 countries, including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran, had provided assistance to China.
A joint team from the greater Chicago region reportedly delivered 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei Province on 30 January. Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization, in coordination with the Federal Express, delivered 200,000 masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves, to Wuhan and hospitals by 30 January by emergency air.
On 5 February, the Gates couple announced a donation of $100 million to the World Health Organization to finance vaccine development and treatment while protecting “high-risk populations in Africa and South Asia”.
According to Interaksyon, the Government of China donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6 February, after Senator Richard Gordon had delivered 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross Society announced that it would provide assistance to China worth $2.26 million.
Japan donated 1 million masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment to Wuhan, Russia shipped more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany shipped 10,000 protective suits and various other medical supplies to China, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China, and pledged an additional $100 million in financial support to affected countries and regions. After the Chinese case appeared to have stabilized, China also provided assistance to other countries and regions affected by the epidemic.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent experts and medical supplies to Italy to help it cope with the outbreak of the new coronary virus.
The entrepreneur Maun delivered 1.1 million reagent kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective suits to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, which were distributed by the African Union.
Ma'un later delivered 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
In addition to this, Maun donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and reagent boxes made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 sets of coronary virus test kits manufactured in China with an accuracy of only 30 per cent, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, believed to come from China but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in Latin America and parts of Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched an emergency support initiative for developing countries.
The World Health Organization commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in preventing and controlling the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SAR epidemic and the crisis. In the SAR epidemic, the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing the facts and impeding prevention and containment efforts, while in the current crisis, the central government “has begun to update the situation regularly before the New Year's holiday in the agricultural calendar in order to avoid panic”.
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central government to impose a seal on Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated strongly that, while this “is certainly not a recommendation of the World Health Organization” it “reflects the determination to contain the spread of the epidemic from the regions where the epidemic is most concentrated” and referred to it as an “unprecedented” initiative in the history of public health. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the outbreak constituted the sixth public health emergency of international concern since its first implementation during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, noted that the identification of public health emergencies of international concern was based on “global transmission risks, especially to low- and middle-income countries with inadequate health systems”.
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tandessai stated that “there is no reason to take measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade” and that “the World Trade Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and mobility”.
On 5 February, the World Health Organization called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund the strategic readiness of low-income countries, stating that there was an urgent need to support countries that “have no supporting systems for testing people infected with the virus”.
Tandesser further issued a statement declaring that “the weakest link determines how powerful we are” and urging the international community “to invest immediately, otherwise it will be even more costly in the future.” On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO), at a press conference, identified the disease as COVID-19.
On the same day, Tandessé stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed that “the United Nations will do everything in its power to respond to the epidemic”.
To that end, the United Nations launched the United Nations Crisis Management Group to coordinate the United Nations response as a whole. The World Health Organization stated that it could “focus on the health response, while other agencies could use their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development impacts of the epidemic”.
On 14 February, a joint mission to China led by the World Health Organization (WHO) was launched to send international and WHO experts to China on the ground, to assist in the response to the local epidemic and to assess “the seriousness and transmissibleness of the disease” by convening seminars and meetings with key national institutions, and to assess the impact of “provincial and district response activities, including differences in urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that “greater global efforts should be made to prepare adequately for a possible coronary virus pandemic” and noted that, while it was still too early to call the pandemic, countries should be “ready”.
In response to Iran’s growing epidemic, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to the country to assess the situation. On February 28, World Health Organization officials claimed that the global risk level of the coronary virus epidemic had been moved from “high” to “high” – the highest alert and risk level of the methodology.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director, Health Emergency Project, World Health Organization, warned in a statement: “This is a real check of governments around the world: sobering up.
The virus may be approaching, be prepared” and Governments are urged to respond correctly to avoid a “worst-case scenario” worldwide.
Ryan further noted that the current data was not sufficient to allow public health officials to declare their entry into the global pandemic, which would mean that “we basically accept that all people on Earth may be exposed to the virus”.
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of the new coronary virus constituted a global pandemic.
According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, “Deeply concerned about the dramatic proliferation and severity of the epidemic and the reality of inaction”, the World Health Organization has been severely criticized for its perceived mishandling of the global pandemic, including delaying the announcement of public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.
Among the stronger objections were the petition for the resignation of the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, which, as of 6 April, had been signed by 73.3 million people.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of everyone during the CIVD-19 pandemic.
The Group noted that everyone has a right to life-saving interventions and that the Government should assume this responsibility.
The expert group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against specific groups.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, groups living in extremely poor conditions, detainees, refugees and other unidentified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are actively addressing the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform aimed at providing timely and comprehensive information and views and recommendations on policy responses worldwide.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the impact of closures and mobility restrictions, this figure has a national policy tracking system designed to help countries learn from each other and to promote a concerted global response to the challenge of the new coronary virus.
As the pandemic first erupted in Hubei Province, China, the United States, the British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Goff and the son of Brazilian President Yail Bossonaro, Eduardo Bossonaro, criticized the Chinese Government ' s approach.
Several CCPC provincial administrators were removed from their posts for mishandling of immunization in China, reflecting central dissatisfaction with the response of local political institutions to the epidemic.
According to some commentators, this was intended to avoid public dissatisfaction with the Central Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a result of the outbreak of the new coronary virus.
Some Chinese officials (e.g. Zhao Lijeng) denied that the previously recognized COVID-19 outbreak began with Wuhan and supported the conspiracy theory that the new coronary virus pneumonia originated in the United States or Italy.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, once described the new coronary virus as the “China virus” or the “Wuhan virus”, and called China's “censorship system” to intensify the spread of the virus and turn it into the current global pandemic”, which in turn was perceived by some critics as a form of racial discrimination and “dissipated the concern that its Government had failed to contain the virus”.
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the Government of the United States outlining a communication strategy, apparently issued by the National Security Council, which stated that “all of this is connected with China.
We have been told to disseminate this message as much as possible in any way, including press conferences and television appearances.” Media outlets such as Politicians, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claim that China's assistance to the affected countries is intended to promote its global reach.
Josep Borrell, European Union Head of Foreign Policy, warned that there was a “geopolitics factor for influence, including through good offices and “generic politics”.
Borrel added that “China, unlike the United States, is a responsible and reliable partner”.
China also called on the United States to lift the sanctions imposed on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and allegedly provided assistance to the latter two countries.
On 3 April, 100,000 masks donated by Maun to Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions.
The United States authorities have also been accused of transferring aid sent to other countries to their own countries.
Mask disputes were also reported between Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as other countries, such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey intercepted hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
At the beginning of the month, the Italian Government criticized the European Union for insufficient support for Italy affected by the new coronary virus.
The Italian Ambassador to the European Union, Maurizio Massari, stated: “There was only a bilateral response from China.
This, of course, is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, Russian President Putin, following a conversation with Italian Prime Minister Kont, arranged for Russian troops to send military doctors, special disinfectors and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian press quotes an anonymous “high-ranking political official”, saying that 80 per cent of Russia's aid “was of little use to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of launching a charismatic “geopolitics and diplomacy” offensive.
The Governor of Lombardi, Attlio Fontana, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent to the United States a cargo aircraft with medical assistance.
A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, stated that “[Putin], in providing assistance to his American colleagues, believes that, once the American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials have resumed their capacity, they will pay back if necessary.”
The NATO “defendants 2020” military exercise planned for Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war, will be scaled down.
The Secretary-General of the nuclear disarmament movement, Kate Hudson, criticized the “defendant 2020” exercise: “In a time of global public health crisis, the exercise endangers not only the lives of the United States and many European countries participating in the national army, but also the inhabitants of the countries in which it takes place.” The Iranian Government was seriously affected by the epidemic, with some 24 parliamentarians and 15 other current or former politicians infected.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders requesting assistance. The letter stated that United States sanctions on Iran had prevented Iran from accessing international markets, making it difficult to combat the epidemic.
Political analysts expect the epidemic to have a negative impact on Donald Trump’s ability to be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Foreign relations between Japan and South Korea have also deteriorated as a result of the global pandemic.
Japan declared that all persons entering from Korea were subject to quarantine for a period of two weeks at government-designated locations, and the Republic of Korea subsequently criticized Japan for the vague and passive nature of this “quarantine measure”.
Korean society initially showed a polarized attitude towards the crisis response of President Yung Jian.
Many Koreans have signed the petition, some calling for impeachment, accusing the government of mishandling the epidemic, and others commending his strategy. The pandemic has prompted many countries to adopt emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this may lead to increased government control over power.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Oban Victor ruling indefinitely by decree, suspending Parliament and elections, and punishing anyone found to have disseminated false information about the virus and the management of the government crisis.
The multiplicity of supply shortages can be attributed to the outbreak of the new coronary virus, which stems from the increased use of equipment, panic shopping and disruption of factory and logistics operations to counter the epidemic worldwide.
The Food and Drug Surveillance Authority of the United States issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment owing to increased consumer demand and disruptions in supply.
A high incidence of panic shopping led to the emptiness of essential items such as food, sanitary paper and bottled water on shelves, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the science and technology industry has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronics.
According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tan Desai, public demand for PPE increased 100 times.
This demand resulted in a 20-fold increase in the price of such products compared to their usual peaks, as well as a delay of 4 to 6 months in the supply of medical supplies.
It also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment. The World Health Organization warned that this would pose a threat to medical personnel.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The campaign led to a shortage of baby formula in supermarkets, which was then banned by the Australian government. Despite the severity of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, there was no serious shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of and illegal trade in key products have been very successful, avoiding serious food shortages, while Europe and North America anticipate such problems.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not declined significantly, but industry representatives are of the view that prices are likely to rise.
The emptiness of food shelves is only temporary, even in Wuhan, and Chinese government officials have released stocks of pork to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Italy has similar legal provisions requiring food producers to supply stocks in response to such emergencies.
The global economic damage has had an impact on China: a media report on March 16 stated that the first two months of 2020, as a result of government measures to curb the epidemic, the Chinese economy suffered a huge shock, with retail sales falling by 20.5 per cent.
As mainland China is the main economic and manufacturing centre of the world, the outbreak of the virus was seen as a major threat to global economic stability.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that the market would remain unstable until there was a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative impact of the outbreak on global economic growth was likely to be greater than the 2002-2004 SARE epidemic.
An expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, estimated that the impact of the epidemic on the global supply chain would amount to over $300 billion, possibly for up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was in a “difficult situation” following a sharp drop in oil prices as a result of falling demand in China.
On 24 February, the global stock market fell as a result of a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, as a result of growing public concern about the new coronary virus epidemic, various United States stock indices, including the NASDAQ 100 index, the Standard & Poor ' s 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, showed the largest decline since 2008, with a point 1,191, the largest single-day decline since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices fell by more than 10 percent that week.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China ' s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The population ' s fear of the new coronary virus led to a further collapse of the stock market, with the largest drop occurring on March 16.
The economic downturn was seen by many as an approximate event.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the central banks and the states for taking timely and urgent measures.
Central banks responded faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism has become one of the most affected industries, as a result of the travel ban, the closure of public places, such as tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments to avoid travel.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and Australian Airlines, cancelled their flights because of declining demand, while British feeder Airlines Flybe, unfortunately, collapsed.
The cruise industry has suffered more than ever before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been forced to close.
The epidemic coincided with the spring season in China, which was supposed to be an important tourist season.
The national and local governments cancelled a series of events involving crowds, including the annual Spring Festival, and private enterprises closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Disneyland in Shanghai.
Many New Year ' s events and tourist attractions, including the Beijing Palace and traditional temples, were cancelled and closed to prevent large-scale crowds.
Of the 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China, 24 extended the New Year ' s Leave to 10 February, requiring most enterprises not to resume work before that date.
These regions account for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong, China, raised the level of its response to communicable diseases to the highest level, declared a state of emergency, suspended schools until March, and cancelled the New Year’s celebrations. The retail trade was affected globally, and shop hours were shortened or temporarily closed.
Retail outlets in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 per cent.
Retail outlets in North America and the Middle East fell by 50-60 per cent.
In addition, the epidemic led to a 33-43 per cent drop in passenger traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Additional measures, such as additional sanitation facilities, the installation of heat scanners to measure the body temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of activities, have been taken by shopping centre operators around the world. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could result in between 14 million and 22 million more people living in extreme poverty in Latin America than in the absence of the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, there were approximately 5 million people unemployed in China.
China has nearly 300 million rural workers, many of whom remain in homes in the interior provinces or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to St. Louis’ Federal Reserve Bank estimates, the new coronary virus epidemic could lead to 47 million unemployment in the United States and possibly 32% unemployment. India’s blockade has led to the unemployment of tens of millions of (daily paid) Indian farmers.
In the second half of the month, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for universal benefits. Nearly half a million German companies used a government-subsidized timed working system for their employees.
Both France and the United Kingdom have also adopted the German timed work compensation system.
The performing and cultural industries have also been devastated by the epidemic, with organizations operating globally, as well as employees and individuals employed.
The Arts and Cultural Industries Organization strives to maintain its mission (usually funded by the Government), to demonstrate cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions around the world had been closed indefinitely to varying degrees, and the planned exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed.
To address this situation, efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The epidemic will soon also lead to the cancellation of many religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as festivals, concerts, technical seminars, and fashion shows, and will rapidly increase its negative impact.
The film industry was also hit. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations to be held in Rome during the last week of Christian Pentecostal Ramadan.
Many parishes recommend that older Christians stay at home and do not attend mass on Sundays; some churches conduct worship through radio, live on-line or television, while others allow worship in their cars.
Christian pilgrims have not been seen on St. Peter's Square as a result of the closure of its large and small churches in Roman Catholic parishes, and other religious groups have cancelled or restricted worship or limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, monasteries and pilgrims.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the subsequent closure of the holy sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the worst damage to the world sports agenda since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 European League, the 2019-20 British Super League, the 2020 European League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 All American Hockey Federation season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were scheduled to take place at the end of July; on 24 March, the IOC announced that the event would be “rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021.” Casinos and other playgrounds around the world were closed, and field poker competitions were postponed or cancelled.
As a result, many gamblers turn to online gambling, and many online gambling sites report a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling tour concerts.
Many large theatres, such as the Broadway Theatre, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists also seek to continue to create and share works via the Internet as a substitute for traditional live performances, such as live concerts or the creation of web “festivities” for artists to perform, publish and promote their works.
On the Internet, numerous web-based myths, on the theme of the new coronary virus, spread, and at a time of growing uncertainty, many began to turn to humor and distraction.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudices, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asians and people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries have been on the rise.
Fear, suspicion and hatred have occurred in many countries and regions, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Numerous reports in February of this year, the majority of which were still confined to China, documented the racist sentiments of different groups around the world towards Chinese, arguing that Chinese should be infected with the virus or subjected to so-called legitimate reprisals.
A number of African countries have also witnessed an increase in anti-China sentiment.
It was reported that many residents of the Wuhan and Hubei regions suffered from geographical discrimination.
Both online and online, there are voices in support of the Chinese and residents of the most seriously affected areas.
As the epidemic spread to other hotspot countries, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a serious outbreak of COVID-19, and people from that country could also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Some citizens, such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea, initially signed petitions to prohibit Chinese from entering the country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the #ChinaDontComeToJapan (Chinese don't come to Japan) topic was widely disseminated on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increasing number of racial abuses and attacks.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, has been criticized for referring to the new coronary virus as the “China virus”, whose statements are perceived by critics as racially discriminatory and anti-Chinese.
Ukrainian protesters attacked the bus from Vuhan to New Sanzari, which contained Ukrainian and foreign evacuees.
Students from north-eastern India (on the border with China) and studying in major cities in India were also reportedly harassed by the outbreak of a new coronary virus.
The Chairman of the Indian People's Party, West Bengal, Dileep Gosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature, “so God wants revenge on them”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta as “wrong.” In China, xenophobia and racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents were also exacerbated by the pandemic, and foreigners were described as “foreign garbage” and should be the target of “waste disposal”.
Many newspapers with payment walls have lifted the restrictions on payment walls for some or all of the reports on the new coronary virus.
Many science publishers have publicly published scientific papers on the epidemic.
Other scientists have chosen to share their findings quickly on preprint servers such as BioRxiv.

2019 Laboratory tests of respiratory coronary virus diseases (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 viruses include detection of the presence of the virus and the emergence of antibodies following detection of infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronary virus and determines the presence of the virus in the sample.
This test is a speciality test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
This can be used to determine whether there is a recent infection or whether there is an active infection.
Antibody testing (serotesting) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody testing shows how many people are infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms who have not been reported or have no symptoms.
The test results determine the exact mortality rate of the disease, as well as the level of immunization of the population.
Owing to the limited number of tests, as of March 2020, no country/area had been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among its population.
As of March 23, no country/area had more than 3 per cent of its population tested, and the number of countries/areas tested varied considerably.
Such disparities may also seriously affect reported case mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly overestimated.
Real-time reversion of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing using throat shawl is available only within the first week of the infection.
Normally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test, which is conducted with the swab, is only completed within the first week after the infection, and reliable results can be obtained.
After that, the virus disappeared in the throat but continued to reproduce in the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week of infection, the sample can be replaced with a deep-absorbent extract obtained through a straw, or with cough (silt).
The release of rRT-PCR in January 2020 at Charité Hospital, Berlin, was one of the early PCR tests and the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the UK also developed a test method. On January 28, 2020, the Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinically based SARS-CoV-2 test box (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain approval for the urgent use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test box. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed 2019 new coronal viruses (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panels to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resources Department.
The early version of the test box used three genetic tests, one of which caused uncertainty of results due to reagent deficiencies, while the Atlanta CDC experienced detection bottlenecks; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The two-part test method was not found reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and the local laboratory were allowed to start testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Regulatory Authority under an emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that the CIVD-19 test, based on RT-PCR, could be conducted nationwide from March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics similarly announced that it would provide a nationwide COVID-19 test from March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limits have been declared; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing is the responsibility of the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR) for development and production.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federation Health Surveillance Agency. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic developed a reagent box for detection of COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, a test method for Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which made it possible to complete a large number of tests within 3.5 hours, thus enabling a device to conduct approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA issued the emergency authorization for the use of the m2000 system using the Abbott system (EUA); FDA previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, an approximately 45-minute test for Cepheid was also authorized for emergency use by the FDA.
The FDA has approved a test method to replace PCR with a temperature augmentation technique such as nucleic acid.
Since the method does not require a series of warming cycles, positive results can be obtained in only 5 minutes, and negative results can be determined in 13 minutes.
The U.S. currently has about 18,000 such devices, and Abbott is expected to increase production so that 50,000 tests per day can be provided. Taiwan is developing a test using monoclonal antibodies (specifically combined with the new coronary virus ' s nuclear shell protein (N protein), hoping that it will provide the results in 15 to 20 minutes, as with the rapid flu test.
An overview of the literature in March 2020 concluded that “in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the chest tiles was small, and the performance of the CT [computer fault scan] may be obvious, even before the symptoms appeared”.
Typical features of CT include pulmonary filamental glass shadow, with expansive asymmetrical and subsequent fabrics.
As the disease progresses, it will develop sub-pleasure, gravel routing and pulmonary changes.
A study of PCR and CT comparing Wuhan (the initial outbreak of the current pandemic) shows that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate and many of its visual characteristics overlap with other pneumonia and disease.
As of March 2020, the ARS recommended that “CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a first-line detection tool for diagnosing COVID-19.” Starting in March 2020, the CDC recommended the use of PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to the infection is the generation of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect individual infections about seven days after the onset of the symptoms in order to determine the immunisation of the monitored population.
These measurements are available in many clinical laboratories with high flux automated systems, but their availability depends on the productivity of the systems.
For CLT, although the immune response can be tracked by sequence samples, it is usually measured using an extra-week blood sample.
In the case of PoCT, a blood sample is generally obtained with skin piercing.
There is no need to execute extraction steps before testing, unlike the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved the testing methods declared by 29 entities, which are now able to distribute their anti-medical test kits.
As of April 7, 2020, FDA approved only one test under an emergency use authorization. In late March, 2020, Ommon Medical Experimental Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics' test kits were approved in Europe for the detection of virus IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
Hundreds of samples can be detected within an hour of detection capacity, so much faster than conventional PCR measurements of the virus RNA.
Normally, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. At the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the anti-medical test kits it purchased were sufficiently useful.
The UK NHS announced that it is piloting a home-based programme for the detection of suspected cases, which eliminates the risk of patients contracting others when they go to hospital, as well as the risk that ambulances will have to be disinfected when they are used. In the case of free-riding COVID-19 suspected cases, medical professionals can take appropriate precautions to extract samples.
In Germany, the National Association of Médecins Sanitaires stated on 2 March that non-residential institutions had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day, and 10,700 tests the previous week.
If tests are conducted at the request of a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany, the total weekly detection capacity in Germany is 160,000 copies.
As of 19 March, exit testing had been provided in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of persons tested in Germany was not known, as only the number of persons who reported positive results was reported.
An initial laboratory survey showed that, as of the 12th week of 2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020) had been tested and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were detected positive. Researchers at Technion and Rambam hospitals in Israel developed and tested a method for testing 64 patient samples simultaneously, i.e., aggregated samples, and conducted further tests only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, the Great Genome of Hua (BGI) temporarily established a 2000 flat-metre emergency detection laboratory called the Eye of Fire, which was put into use on 5 February 2020 and could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
Under the supervision of Wang Jian, founder of China's great genes, the laboratory was built five days ago, and the modelling shows that, if the above detection capability was not achieved, the number of cases in the north of the lake would be 47 per cent higher and the corresponding costs of treating isolation doubled.
Immediately following the Wuhan laboratory, fire-eye laboratories were established in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, and are now being established in 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily flux of laboratory tests totalled 50,000 per day. The open source, multi-routine designs issued by Origami Assays made it possible to conduct COVID19 tests for up to 1,122 patient samples only 93 times. These balanced designs can operate in small laboratories without automatic fluid transporters.
As of March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some of the sponsors to explore a sample preparation programme involving heating samples up to 98 °C (208 °F) for up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on 31 March that new coronal virus testing had now been carried out for more of its population, with more people being tested than in any other country, and that detection levels were being expanded to allow large numbers of people to be tested.
This detection capability is achieved through the use, on the one hand, of the drive-through test and, on the other hand, the funding of the Group 42 and the Chinese Big Genome (based on its “fire-eye” emergency testing laboratory in China) to set up high flux laboratories to respond to large-scale population detection needs.
The laboratory, which was built within 14 days and capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, was the world ' s first laboratory of this size to operate outside China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Japan and the United States have developed different detection methods for various parts of the coronary virus gene map.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method of producing inspection test kits, sending reagent boxes for low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own reagent boxes.
Germany’s approach was announced on January 17, 2020; the program developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be used until January 28, limiting US detection capabilities. Both China and the US experienced problems with the reliability of test kits in the early stages of the outbreak, and these two countries and Australia were unable to provide enough test boxes to meet the needs and the recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts believe that extensive testing in Korea has been instrumental in reducing the spread of the new coronary virus.
Thanks to the testing capacity established by the Korean Government over the past few years, it has been concentrated in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programmes as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The spread of the virus has led to a very high demand for testing, resulting in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of scavengers and chemical reagents is beginning to strain.
In March 2020, China reported on the accuracy of its test box.
In the United States, the test box developed by the CDC was “defective”; then, the government removed bureaucratic impediments to private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from China’s company, Shenzhen Erie Biotechnology Ltd., and found the test results to be inaccurate.
It explained that inaccuracies in the results of the tests could have been caused by the incorrect collection of samples or the erroneous use of the test kits.
The Spanish Cabinet has indicated that the recovered reagent boxes that returned the wrong results will be replaced with another reagent box provided by the Shenzhen Bioeasi. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were found to be incorrect. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test boxes from China, and the results were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these test boxes should be thrown into the Danube River. The Turkish Ministry of Health, Ateş Kara, stated that the test boxes purchased by Turkey from China were “high in error” and did not “use them.” The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test boxes from China, which were declared unusable in April 2020.
Positive effects can be obtained by testing, segregating persons who have tested positive and tracking the history of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons.
Researchers working in Vò, Italy (the first Italian case of the death of the COVID-19 patient), conducted two rounds of testing of a total of about 3,400 people, each of which was about 10 days apart.
About half of them were detected as positive and asymptomatic, and all the cases detected were isolated.
New infections have been completely eliminated through travel restrictions on communities.
Through large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted entry travel, detection and isolation, the transmission of the coronary virus in Singapore was much slower than in other developed countries/regions, and Singapore did not take extreme restrictive measures, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail places.
Many activities were cancelled in Singapore and residents were advised to stay at home on March 28, but the school resumed on time after the holiday on 23 March.
Several other countries/areas, such as Ireland and the Republic of Korea, have also managed to contain the epidemic through large-scale tracking of contacts, restricted access travel, detection and isolation, and less radical closures.
A statistical study found that the lower the case mortality rate, as compared to the number of deaths detected, may be the reason why these countries are better able to detect only mild or insymptomatic groups.
WHO recommends countries with no detection capacity and limited country-level laboratory experience with COVID-19 to send their top five positive and top ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for validation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the “positive %” column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
In other cases, under the same conditions, countries that only detect inpatients have a higher rate of positive detection than countries that test all citizens, whether symptoms or not.
Hand-washing, also known as hand cleaning, is hand-cleaning for the removal of dust, oil, microbial or other useless substances from the hands.
The insistence on hand-washing with soap at certain “critical moments” on a daily basis prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which can be transmitted by means of manure and mouth.
If people do not wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membrane), they may also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common flu.
Five critical moments in a day when it is essential to wash hands with soap: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's hips or changing a diaper, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after processing food, or before and after processing raw, fish or poultry meat.
In the absence of soap and water, the hand can be cleaned with grass ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand-washing in the following cases:
Food preparation before, during and after.
Take care of the patient before and after.
After changing diapers or cleaning children's buttocks.
Scrubbing, coughing or sneezing after.
After touching animals, animal food or animal faeces.
Medical manual hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
The washing of hands before the delivery of drugs or medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of the disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand-washing is the removal of pathogens (bacterial, viral or other micro-organisms that cause disease) and chemical substances that may harm humans or cause disease on their hands.
Hand-washing is particularly important for people involved in food processing or working in the medical field, but it is also a very important practice for the public.
The health benefits of hand-washing include minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary viruses and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
and to reduce the infant mortality rate at birth in the home.
A 2013 study showed that the improvement of hand-washing practices has contributed slightly to the increase in height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioural change (e.g. hand-washing with soap).
This simple act can reduce the death rate of the above-mentioned diseases by nearly 50 per cent.
Promoting hand-washing as an intervention can reduce the incidence of approximately one third of diarrhoeal incidents, with the effect of providing clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhoea by 48%. As spontaneous behaviour in households, schools and communities around the world, handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections.
Pneumonia, as a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause a total of nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund (UNICEF) indicated that, compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, the conversion of pre-food and post-occupational washing of hands with soap into deep-rooted habits could save more lives, reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half and from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
As part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project, hand-washing initiatives are often accompanied by other sanitation interventions.
Hand-washing also prevents the spread of haemorrhagic disease through direct physical contact.
Hand-washing can have a minor adverse effect, i.e. frequent hand-washing can lead to dry skin, resulting in skin damage.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand-washing can lead to skin itching, hysteria, known as humid rash or hand-skin inflammation, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
Excessively frequent hand-washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive disease (OCD).
In order to reduce the spread of disease, it is essential to wash hands with soap in five critical moments of the day: after toilet (urinary, cesspooling), after cleaning the buttocks of children (replaced diapers), before feeding children, before feeding, before processing food and before processing raw, fish or poultry meat.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hands should also be washed in the right manner in the following cases: before and after the treatment of incisions or wounds; after sneezing, coughing or snorting; after touching animal faeces or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries/regions, hand-washing rates with soap are low.
A study of hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of households had hand-washing habits with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States was close to the average at 77%; China had the lowest rate at 23%.
The Basic Health Care Plan introduced by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a large-scale initiative to improve children's health and education.
The core of this national plan is deworming twice a year, supported by daily hand-washing with soap and brushing with fluorescent toothpaste.
In Indonesia, the programme was also successfully implemented.
The incorporation of soap or cleaning agents into water can better remove microbes from the skin.
The main role of soap and cleaners is to reduce solvent barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is not effective in cleaning skin, as fats and proteins (parts of organic soil) are not soluble in water.
However, cleaning and washing of hands requires reasonable water ...
Solid soap, which can be reused, may retain bacteria left behind by previous use.
A small number of studies investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap and concluded that bacteria could not be transferred because bacteria could be washed out of foam.
CDC, however, still claims that “it is preferable to use non-contact liquid soap”.
Anti-bacterial soap has been widely promoted among the healthy public.
To date, there has been no evidence of the use of recommended antibacterial or disinfectant to select antibiotics resistant micro-organisms in the natural world.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as trichlorfon, which has a large strain of resistant micro-organisms.
Therefore, even if anti-bacterial soap is not chosen for antibiotic resistance strains, anti-bacterial soap may not be as effective as publicity.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulations may also contain acids (acetic acid, anti-hacid acid, emulsion acid), anti-bacterial beryllic acid, as well as more skin modifiers (amerium, vitamins, mintol, plant extractors) as pH-value regulators. A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that common soap has the same effect as consumer-grade anti-bacterium soap containing trichlorsa in the prevention of disease and in the removal of bacteria from hands.
The hot water washes its hands comfortably, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grows rapidly at the body temperature (37 °C).
However, with regard to the removal of natural fats containing soil and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water.
Scientific research has confirmed that the use of warm water is not effective in reducing microbes on hand, contrary to the prevailing view.
The water-free hand-washing or non-washing hand-washing liquid is a non-water-based hand-cleaning agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners, also known as alcohol hydrazine, free rinse, or unwashed rinse, were widely popular.
Most of the formulations of these hand-washing fluids contain isopropanol or ethanol, then add a thicker agent, such as capom (acrylic polymer), to form a gel, or add a wet agent, such as glycerine, to form a liquid, or foam, to be easy to use, and to ease the skin drying caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antibacterial activity.
Alcoholic handlids can kill bacteria, multi-pharmaceutical resistant bacteria (magnetic silicone (MRSA) and vresculosis (VRE)), tuberculosis, as well as a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory symbiotic virus (RSV), nasal viruses, cow pox, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
The alcohol content of 70% of the bacterium is used 30 seconds later to kill 99.97% of the bacterium on the hand (a reduction of 3.5 orders of magnitude, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels), and in 1 minute to reduce the bacterium on the hand by 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 orders of magnitude). Free handwashing is the most effective for bacteria, and slightly less for some viruses.
Alcoholic hydrazine has little effect on viruses like the virus (norovirus, also known as Novak, Norwalk), the most common cause of gastrointestinal inflammation.
Wash the hand and the back of the hand and between the fingers and at the end of all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips must also be fully cleaned and washed on both palms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States suggest that it is better to wash hands, rather than use free hand-washing fluids, especially when the hands look dirty.
The ease with which they are used and the rapid loss of activity of micro-organisms is increasing; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand-washing, unless soap and water are not available for use.
The frequent use of alcohol-free hand-washing fluids can lead to dry skin, unless the formulation is accompanied by a lubricant and/or wetting agent.
Glycerine and/or other lubricant may be added to the formulation to reduce or eliminate alcohol-induced skin drying.
In clinical trials, alcohol-free hand-washing fluids containing lubricant can significantly reduce the incidence of skin irritation and skin drying compared to soap or antibacterial detergents.
Allergy exposure to skin inflammation, exposure to measles syndrome, or allergies to additives in alcohol or alcohol porcelain are rare.
The low likelihood of irritation of irritated skin in alcohol, free of hand-washing fluids, compared to hand-washing with soap and water, is an attractive reason.
Waterless detergents, while effective, do not remove organic substances from their hands, but only disinfect them.
Thus, free hand-washing fluids are less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, as these pathogens are still in hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free, hand-washing fluids depends to a large extent on the composition and formulation, and has historically had much worse effects than alcohol and alcohol hand-washing fluids.
Recently, formulations using ammonium benzachlor have been proven to be persistent and cumulative antibacterial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to have a reduced effect after repeated use, possibly as a result of a gradual adverse dermal reaction.
Many in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use grass ash or earth instead.
Grass ash or earth is better than hand-washing by water alone, but not as much as soap.
One such problem is that if soil or grass ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, the spread of the disease may be accelerated rather than slowed.
Like soap, grass ash is a disinfectant, as it becomes alkaline solution after encountering water.
WHO suggested that, if soap was not available, it could be replaced with grass ash or sand.
The correct hand-washing steps recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Wetting hands with flowing warm water or cool water.
The recommended flow of water is due to the potential contamination of the titanium basin, and the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
A sufficient amount of soap is used to wash up again and again to produce foam, while cleaning the backs of hands, between fingers and nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than using water alone.
At least 20 seconds to wash.
Washing produces friction, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and the longer the washing time, the more bacteria are removed.
Full cleaning with current water.
Washing the hands of water basins can lead to re-pollution.
Dry with clean towels or dry with natural dry.
The humid side of the hand is more susceptible to re-contamination. The thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and the nails are the most frequently neglected parts.
Artificial nails and broken nail oils may hide micro-organisms.
It is generally recommended that wet milk be used to avoid manual drying; dry skin can cause skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Where piped water and/or soap are not available in developing countries, a variety of low-cost measures can be made available to facilitate hand-washing, such as pouring water through a floating barrel or pores, and/or washing hands with grass ash (where necessary). Where water supplies are limited (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), hand-washing programmes, such as simple taps and other low-cost methods, can be used.
The simple technology of a simple tap is to hang a can with a rope and then pour a small amount of water into the hand through a pedal, and then use soap.
The effective drying of hands is an important step in the process of manual hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective methods of drying hands in public health.
A growing number of studies have shown that paper towels are healthier than electric dry cell phones provided in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, carried out a study sponsored by the Europaan Tisse Symposium in the paper towel industry to compare hygiene levels with paper towels, warm dry phones and more modern spray dry phones.
After washing hands, dry hands are dryed with a warm wind dry cell phone, with an average increase of 194 per cent in the total amount of bacteria on the fingers and 254 per cent in the total amount of bacteria on the palms.
On the other hand, the amount of bacterium on the fingers increased by 42 per cent on average, and the amount of bacterium on the palm by 15 per cent on average.
After washing hands, the amount of bacterium on the fingers is reduced by an average of 76% and the amount of bacterium on the palm is reduced by an average of 77%. Scientists have also conducted tests to determine whether dry hand methods may cause cross-infection among other bathroom users and bathroom facilities.
Sprayed dry cell phones allegedly sprayed air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) and were able to blow out microbes on their hands and bodies, which could pollute other bathroom users and toilet facilities within 2 m.
With a warm wind dry cell phone, microbes can spread beyond the dry cell phone at 0.25 m.
The results of the dry hand with a paper towel show no significant microbial transmission. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess different dry hand methods.
The following changes in bacteria have been observed after dry hands:
The study involved a large number of different dry cellular producers and compared them with paper towel dry hands.
During travel, in the absence of soap and water, the option is to wash their hands with sterilized and wet towels.
Alcohol should have a minimum alcohol content of 60% free handwashing fluid.
Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor, found in 1846 that handwashing was effective in preventing the spread of diseases in hospitals, but only after a long period of time, medical personnel were forced to wash their hands.
The hospital uses electronic devices that provide feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found a decrease in the rate of infection following the use of these equipment.
Medical personnel wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using a sufficient amount of soap and water or gel during hand washing to produce foam and wash various parts of their hands.
Hands and fingers are tied to each other.
If there are residues between the nails, they can be removed with a hard brush.
As the remaining water on hand may still be bacterial, it is necessary to wash and dry it with clean towels.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the tap (where necessary, a paper towel should be used to open the exit door).
This prevents the re-pollution of the hands as a result of exposure to these surfaces.
In health institutions, hand-washing is aimed at eliminating pathogenic microorganisms (“bacterials”) and avoiding transmission.
Reports in the New England Medical Journal indicate that, in most medical settings, handwashing is still not at an acceptable level and that a large number of medical personnel often forget handwashing before contact with patients, leading to microbial transmission.
One study shows that proper hand-washing, coupled with other simple procedures, can reduce the blood-flow infection rate associated with the catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing methods in medical institutions.
The organization also posted a draft manual health guide on its website for public comment.
Whitby et al. provided a summary.
Commercial equipment can be measured and validated by the counterparty ' s health if there is a need to verify regulatory compliance.
The World Health Organization recommends the “five moments” of hand-washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
Before the sterile operation and
After taking care of the patient, adding anti-bacterial chemicals to soap (“soap” or “anti-bacterial soap”) can cause microbicides from hand-washing agents.
In an environment where there is either a pre-operative or a large number of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms, this fungicide operation may be required. When you “clean” your hands for surgery, you must have rinse with taps, chlorine self-sets or iodine that can be opened and closed without contact, a sterile towel used to wipe your hands, a rinse-free brush and other sterile tools to clean the nails.
All jewelry has to be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands, forearm up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
It does not take long to wash (10 minutes).
When flushing, the water on the forearm must be prevented from flowing back to its hands.
After washing their hands, they dry their hands with sterile cloths and put on surgical clothing.
In order to reduce bacterial transmission, it is advisable to wash hands before and after contact with patients, or to use non-sterilized hand-washing fluids.
In order to control the vinococcal infection in hospitals, one finds that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from the fact that when the frequency of washing hands reaches 20%, when the frequency of cleaning hands rises to over 35%, further benefits are extremely limited.
Compared with the use of anti-bacterial soap, the use of common soap for hand-washing results in a more than three-fold increase in the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food. Compared with the use of alcoholic hand-stamping and the use of anti-bacterial soap for hand-washing (30 seconds each), the proportion of bacterial infections using alcoholic hand-stamping is found to be less than 26% of anti-bacterial soap.
However, the reduction of the H1N1 influenza (HI1N1 influenza A) virus and the indisputable cosmopolus virus (Clostridium dificile spoles) is more effective than alcoholized hand rubbing fluids. The manual hygiene of medical institutions can be improved by training employees in hand washing, increasing the supply of alcohol shoving fluids, and making written and oral reminders to their employees.
Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in various medical settings.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered an important cost-effective tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand-washing facilities in people ' s homes, schools and workplaces makes widespread hand-washing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, the presence of handwashing taps in every private bathroom or adjacent to a sanitation facility is very rare, even if cheap methods are available to build handwashers.
However, the low frequency of hand-washing may also be a result of deep-rooted habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and promotion of hand-washing with soap can influence policy formulation, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes in the population.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic assessment of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing hand-washing rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), while social marketing activities were less effective. One example of a “3-star approach” to hand-washing in schools was promoted by UNICEF, which, among other health requirements, encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When minimum standards are met, schools can rise from one star to the top three stars.
Hand-washing outreach activities could include the construction of hand-washing counters to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of hand-washing awareness is World Hand-washing Day, which seeks to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronary virus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of a hand-washing emoticon.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing and the avoidance of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in developing countries.
However, reports indicate that the promotion of hand-washing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of hand-washing for human health — especially for those who are weak (e.g. mothers who have recently given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals) — were two pioneers in the field of hand-held health in the mid-1900s: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing science in England.
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the odour known as virulent.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medical-borne infections in the 1980s prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be more active in advocating hand-to-hand hygiene, emphasizing hand-to-hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters on “right hand-washing methods” are displayed in public health, office buildings and the hand-washing pool of airport toilets.
The verse “till off” means that a person declares his or her unwillingness to be responsible for, or to be involved in, something.
It comes from the Bible's Matthews, where Pontius Pilate washes his hands after a decision to crucify Jesus, and then turns into an extensive lingua franca in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth began to force her hands to wash in order to try to wash the stains of her imagination, demonstrating her guilt at what she had committed and at what she had encouraged her husband to do.
Research shows that people who think of or envisage immoral behaviour tend to wash their hands more frequently than others and tend to value hand-washing facilities.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands when immoral behaviour is envisaged are unlikely to engage in other “purification” compensatory actions, such as volunteers.
Religion requires hand-washing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand-washing of hand-washing without soap is part of many religious symbols of hand-washing, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, ablution (tavilah) and hand-washing (netilat yadayim) cleaning, hand-washing in Christianity, and minor cleaning in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam demand the washing of hands after a toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
COVID-19 Workplace Control
COVID-19 Workplace prevention and control refers to the prevention of coronary virus diseases using hazardous occupational safety and health measures 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriateness of workplace risk control depends on the specific work site and mission, and should be based on risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of community diseases and risk factors for vulnerable individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
As required by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-level exposure risks work has the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues, and basic infections prevention measures are recommended, including manual hand washing, encouraging staff to live in isolation after illness, compliance with breathing protocol, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium exposure risk work includes work that requires regular or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
Includes staff who come into contact with the general public, such as schools, high population density working environments and some large retail environments.
In addition to the basic prevention of infection, the group should be ventilated using efficient air filters and sneezing protective devices, wearing personal protective equipment and other dangerous control measures in contact with the COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers that there is a high risk of exposure for medical and paramedical staff who come into contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and the risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff perform aerosol-producing operations with known or suspected COVID-19 patients or collect or process specimens from them.
The risk-control measures applicable to such personnel include engineering controls, such as a pressurized ventilator and personal protective equipment suitable for their mission.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have serious implications in the workplace.
Staff members may be absent from work because of illness, need of care or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changes in demand for, or access to, commodities (e.g. shopping in off-peak times, or using distribution or off-load delivery services).
Finally, there is a risk of disruption in product logistics from regions with severe COVID-19 epidemics.
These plans address the level of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors from the family and community environment, and risk factors for self-employed workers, such as older persons or groups with chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the prevention and control measures needed to respond to these risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may be subject to national or local advice.
The objectives of responding to outbreaks include reducing staff-to-work transmission, protecting populations at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response will be affected by the severity of the disease in the enterprise ' s community.
The risk level is a widely used anti-control framework in occupational safety and health, used to group risk control measures according to effectiveness.
If the harm of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering control refers to the separation of employees from work-related hazards, rather than relying on their behaviour, which is also the least cost-effective solution for implementation.
Administrative control refers to changes in work policies or procedures requiring staff or employers to act on their own initiative.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) has less control than engineering control and administrative control, but helps to prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the level of risk to which the staff member is exposed, equipped as applicable (e.g., respirators) and must always be properly worn, regularly inspected and maintained, replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
Under the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure risk work has the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic preventive measures of infection, including hand-washing, that sick workers be segregated from their homes, that breathing protocol be observed during coughing or sneezing, that paper towels and garbage cans be provided, that teleworking be prepared and, if necessary, off-duty, that employees be discouraged from using other people ' s tools and equipment, and that daily cleaning and disinfection in the workplace be maintained.
The timely identification and isolation of potential infectious individuals is key to the protection of workplace personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States recommends that employees with acute respiratory symptoms should be separated from their homes for at least 24 hours until it is determined that there is no fever, heat and any other symptoms, that sick leave policy should be implemented flexibly, that employees be allowed to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees should be clearly informed of the policy.
According to OSHA, the risk of moderate exposure includes work that requires frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within a range of 6 feet (1.8 m), but may cause individuals to become infected with SARS-COV-2 as a result of continuous community transmission near the workplace or as a result of possible recent visits to the COVID-19 epidemic area.
This category of staff includes those employed in schools, high-density working environments and some large-scale retail environments with access to the general public. Engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include the installation of efficient air filters, improved ventilation, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze protection devices, and the installation of exit-free windows to provide client services. Administrative control of this group and high-risk groups includes the encouragement of home-based isolation of sick staff, the replacement of face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, the establishment of crest shifts, the cancellation of non-necessary travel to the COVID-19 outbreak site, the development of emergency communications plans, including a forum to answer staff questions, the provision of up-to-date education and training to staff on risk factors and protective behaviour such as COVID-19, the provision of training in the use of protective clothing and protective equipment to staff who require protective clothing and protective equipment, the provision of resources and work environments that will help to improve personal hygiene, the requirement of manual washing, restrictions on customer and public access to work sites, and the posting of signs on hand-washing and other COVID-19 protective measures.
Such staff should preferably be provided with respirators.
In the event of illness on board an aircraft, appropriate protective measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including placing the patient at a distance of 6 feet from other passengers, assigning a crew member to serve the patient, providing a mask to the patient, or requiring the patient to cover his nose with a paper towel while coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear a one-time medical glove when caring for sick travellers, tactile fluids, or potentially contaminated surfaces.
For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, dangerous control measures also include delayed travel in the event of illness. In the event of heat or other symptoms on board a ship, self-segregate and immediately notify the ship’s medical room.
In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommend that, regardless of the proliferation in the community, schools and childcare facilities should be closed for a short period of time and thoroughly cleaned or disinfected.
For medium- and low-level community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the elimination of other large gatherings such as field visits, rallies and sports classes, choirs or cafeteria meals, increased distance between desks, false peaks and departures, restrictions on non-essential visitors, and separate health offices for children with influenza symptoms.
In addition to a social distance strategy, consideration may be given to extending the time off.
It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who must be in contact with the patients or suspected individuals identified by COVID-19 should follow the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including with appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during the arrest process, the staff member shall first clean and disinfect his or her belt and equipment before using household cleaning spray or rag before it is used, and shall observe standard procedures for the sealing and disposal of personal protective equipment, as well as clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA considers that certain health-care and dormitories workers face high or very high exposure risks.
Staff at high risk of exposure include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff who have physical access to persons known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high when staff perform a pneumatic process for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or process specimens of infected or suspected infected persons.
Flying generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchial mirrors, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity specimen collection.
High-exposure risk morgue staff include staff involved in the preparation of the body of the deceased, who were diagnosed or suspected to be a COVID-19 case; the risk of exposure is higher if autopsies are performed. Additional engineering measures for this risk group include isolation rooms for the identification or suspected cases of COVID-19, including in the course of scavenging procedures.
Some health-care facilities and morgues can also be equipped with specialized negative ventilation systems.
Biosecurity 3 precautionary measures should be applied in the handling of specimens.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends different waiting areas for patients, depending on whether or not the patient is a suspected case of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Authority also recommends that personnel working within 6 feet of a patient known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those performing a fly-spray production process wear a respirator.
The United States requires the use of N95 filter masks or better masks approved by NIOSH in the context of comprehensive documented respiratory protection schemes such as health tests, training, medical examinations, etc.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted via body fluids.
WHO recommends that screening personnel at entry points only wear medical surgical masks.
WHO recommends the use of medical surgical masks, goggles or masks, robes and gloves for staff who need to collect respiratory specimens from patients with COVID-19 as well as to provide care or transfer services to patients without having to carry out the pneumatic process.
Medical surgical masks must be replaced with N95 or FFP2 masks if the pneumatic process is to be performed.
In view of the inadequate global supply of PPE, WHO recommends reducing the demand for PPE through such measures as telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, access to the rooms of patients with COVID-19 only for direct care, the use of PPE only when there is a real need for PPE for a specific mission, the continued use of the same respirator for the care of multiple patients with the same diagnostic results, monitoring and coordination of PPE supply chains and discouraging the use of masks by insymptomatic personnel.

Since this month, we have faced difficult circumstances.
In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have a clear sense of the shared destiny of all humankind, as well as of our responsibilities to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we are well aware that the best response to such challenges requires solidarity, cooperation and community-building around the world, which is at the heart of Wikimedia.
The e-mail, telephone and chat transmission of love and care among all our colleagues is ample proof of the extraordinaryness of our colleagues, with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am greatly grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, appreciation was expressed for our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is that at this moment the world has access to Wikipedia, and at the same time the symbolic power that this vital resource brings to the people of the world to keep it going.
Whether your job is to run a website, pay a salary, or be safe in the community, your hard work is essential to Wikimedia's normal operation.
The world now needs information from Wikipedia more than ever before.
At this stage, the content of our work, and indeed the way it is done, will have an important impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the heavy responsibilities of our colleagues, we will begin next week with some important adjustments to our collaborative approach.
Adjustments to the modus operandi and schedule of work
As mentioned earlier by Robyn, the senior management team met last night to discuss the company ' s working methods and timetable for the following days to months.
At that meeting, we considered what we consider to be the appropriate response to the current challenges facing companies, as well as best practices to ensure that companies maintain sustainable development during the epidemic.
The senior management team agreed to ease the pressure on the company ' s staff, thereby enabling long-term support for the company ' s mission.
We support your efforts to reduce the pressure appropriately.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours per day (or 20 hours per week), with subsequent changes to be notified.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice.
However, given the unpredictable nature of the current world situation, priority will be given to your personal needs, such as taking care of family members, shopping or medical consultations.
We're not following your hours.
If you're sick, please put down your job.
This is self-evident, but we would like to remind you that you can rest assured.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform the manager and help your team to modify the work calendar and schedule to ensure that the key areas of work are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please inform Bryan, Talent and Culture, which will support you and ensure that your situation is properly monitored by the management.
For hourly employees, we pay in full.
We have already expressed our commitment and renewed our commitment to honour the commitments made to the contractors and colleagues working hours.
The salaries we pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of the remuneration received for normal working hours under normal conditions.
Even if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many have chosen to communicate with the outside world through their work, releasing their own pressures.
Our work can bring incredible rewards, especially at this time.
But caring for yourself is still first.
We ask you to remain in communication with the manager so that we can keep up to date and adjust accordingly.
Priority is given to ensuring that important work is carried out.
We must maintain the proper functioning of some important work.
The work carried out by the website reliability engineering team, the human resources operations team, the trust and security team and the fund-raising team (and others) is critical and may require additional support.
We will begin to work with all sectors to assess current goals and shift our focus to support matters that are essential to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, but we need to focus our work on the most important items.
The temporary slowdown will not affect future development.
We do not intend to “overtime” in the wake of the epidemic.
We won't ask you to work overtime, because it doesn't seem realistic at the moment.
We accept that the current environment has changed, and we will set new goals and timetables, as appropriate.
How will the APP (annual plan) change?
In order to adapt to the new realities and the requirements of day-to-day working hours, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule of the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in return for more time to develop a budget that will enable staff to prioritize critical work and take care of themselves and their families, and to adjust the working arrangements for those who need or wish to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
The extended schedule can significantly reduce the current planned workload of the Organization as a whole and reduce the pressure on its work.
We will present the above proposal to the Board next week. If the proposal is adopted, we will update the follow-up work programme to delegates and teams as soon as possible.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this process.
Office conditions, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague from the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a matter of caution, we hired anti-viral cleaners to completely disinfect the San Francisco office.
Using hospital-level disinfection solutions, they disinfect the surfaces and the halls and elevators leading to our floors.
Office buildings are fulfilling their duty-of-care agreements, using corresponding products to ensure the security of tenants.
We are confident that when you decide to return to work, the Office is well prepared to welcome you.
Our office in Washington, D.C., uses the WeWork office, where WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all Washington, D.C. staff.
As of last week, the Washington, D.C. office had been converted to full-time telecommuting, in line with the guidance we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some colleagues in the New York office already know, we have also been discussing issues related to the rental of office space in the Brooklyn area.
These discussions continue, but may be postponed.
Some colleagues were exposed to remote work for the first time.
Other long-range teleworking colleagues would like to provide them with some suggestions for adjusting their modus operandi:
It would be better to keep the meeting time within one to two hours.
If more time is required, please consider spreading the content of the meeting over multiple dates.
The objectives of the meeting are clearly defined, the agenda for the meeting is set and reading materials are sent in advance.
Videoconferencing is used as a default mode of meetings, with online collaboration and communication using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
In each meeting, a moderator is assigned to preside over the meeting, one person is assigned to monitor questions in the chat window and to track changes in the list of speakers, and another person is assigned to help with the proceedings (or in a multi-person collaborative manner).
If you need comfortable headphones, contact the technical support department by e-mail.
Use your health allowance to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributional work with colleagues
The Human Resources Operations Team is studying human engineering guidance in the form of webinars to help all Foundation colleagues work more efficiently during their distributed office hours.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events, such as Wikimedia, funded by the editor, before the World Health Organization announced the epidemic.
These and other restrictions on the cancellation of activities may result in the inability of the recipients of these communities to complete their original donor activities, which we have informed them of, while at the same time promising that none of them will be punished for postponing or modifying these goals.
In the coming week, we will continue to provide more guidance in Wikimania and other district and thematic community meetings.
The global community now seems to be embroiled in the grief caused by the devastation of the epidemic, but it also reflects the relief of being able to maintain a clear focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the future, the CRT team will create a page on Meta-Wiki, which will provide communities with a space to monitor impacts and track community-to-our interactions.
Keep in touch and communicate issues related to COVID-19
We plan to hold a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 Pacific Time, and we will send an invitation later on to your calendar.
At the meeting, we will share some updates, answer your questions and set aside some time for discussion.
Together, we are here to help you.
At the same time, you can find more of the information mentioned in this e-mail on Office Wiki, as well as other important information related to COVID-19.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and consolidate all information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with workers living in countries/areas that are currently severely affected by the epidemic.
If you have any doubts about travel, activities, main workflows or insurance, or if you need other assistance, contact and cooperate with the CRT team at any time.
We are here to provide you with the support and liaison you need.
If you have an intimate or sensitive issue, contact Bryan Judan, head of global human resources operations by e-mail.
While we are faced with these changes, we cannot forgo our work and obligations as a result.
On the contrary, the epidemic reminds us that we may now need to adjust our work and our obligations in ways that have not been done in the past.
We believe that these measures are necessary to enable us to support each other in the continuation of our work, to provide the support we need for our actions and to continue to bring the services on which they depend to the world as a whole.
You can't be afraid of the challenge if you're on the right track.
Now, please support each other and work together to create space for the important work that will take place in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of us to contribute to that goal, and we therefore ask you to take care of yourselves and your family in order to stay in the best possible position when the need arises.
Finally, please remember to wash your hands and do not touch your face.
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and other members of the lead team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (AcE2) is an enzyme attached to the exterior (cellular membrane) of the cell in the lungs, the arteries, the heart, the kidneys and the intestinal tract.
ACE2 is expected to be a drug target for cardiovascular diseases by reducing the content of vascular tension II and increasing the content of Ang (1-7) to contain the activity of the related vascular tension converter enzyme (Angiotensin-converting Enzyme, ACE). ACE2 is also the entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells.
The human source version of this enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.
Angioplasty conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallic enzyme located on the surface of inner and other cells.
ACE2 protein consists of an N-end platinase M2 structure field and a C-end Collectrin kidney amino acid transit protein structure field.
ACE2 is a single-line I membrane protein with enzyme activity structure fields exposed to lung and cell surfaces of other organizations.
Another enzyme, known as sheddase, disassembles the cyto-structured domain of ACE2 from across the membrane structure, and releases the soluble protein into the blood and eventually discharges it into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to a cell membrane, mainly a lung type II pulmonary cell, intestinal peritoneal cells, arteries and vein internal cells of most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 MRNA expression was also found in the cerebral cortex, texture, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counterbalance ACE.
ACE Disruption of vascular tension I to vascular tension II with vascular contraction activity.
ACE2 Pyrepanic Acid Acid Acid Acid Acid at the end of the thorium base (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into an vascular expansionary activity (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also decipher many other platinum groups, including decompressuric acid 9, apelin, neuropressurizers, morphine peptide A and stomach hunger.
ACE2 can also regulate the membrane transport of neutral amino acid trans-protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup disease.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronary viruses into cells, including HcoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that led to SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that led to COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 puncture protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 is combined with the enzyme structure of the cell surface ACE2, leading to ingestion and the transfer of viruses and enzymes to the inner core of the cell.
This entry process, which also requires host filtrate protein enzyme TMPRSS2, triggers the activation of S protein, is currently being studied as a potential cure. Some assume that lowering the ACE2 level in cells may help to combat infection.
However, several professional associations and regulators have recommended the continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic evaluation and an analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the use of ACE inhibitors for treatment of patients at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with intermediate and heart failure, also reduces the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, but the result is less reliable than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The regrouper ACE2 (rhaACE2) was identified as a new approach to treating acute lung damage, which appears to improve the blood flow mechanics of the lungs and the saturation of the blood oxygen of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused by fat and sugar.
The half-life of rhaACE2 in the human body is approximately 10 hours, with an active time of 30 minutes and a functioning process (long time) of 24 hours.
A number of studies have shown that rhaACE2 may be a promising drug for patients whose inhibitors are intolerant or for diseases with an elevated level of circulatory tension II. The efficacy of rhaACE2 injections for acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials.
b'COVID-19 application is a mobile software designed to respond to the 2019-20 coronary virus epidemic, to help track people in close contact and to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the infection (“contacts”).
A number of applications have been developed or introduced in some regions and jurisdictions with the support of official Governments.
A number of frameworks have been established for the construction of close contact tracking applications.
Privacy issues are also a source of concern, in particular the need for some systems to track the geographical location of users of applications.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration of this function in support of Bluetooth applications into Andre and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government has jointly developed an application to support citizens to check for contact with COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently in use in more than 200 cities in China. Singapore has launched an application called TraceTogether.
The application, developed by the local IT community, will be released as open source software and handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based application, “StopKorona!” to track the exposure of potential infections and help health-care institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication Technology and the Ministry of Health of Northern Macedonia.
As of April 14, 2020, the application is awaiting the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the close contact tracking application has entered an advanced stage of development and will be operational in the coming weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar application (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the development of similar applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geo-fence application for patients with COVID-19 diagnostics living in Moscow to ensure that patients do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, cited a number of practical problems that could exist in the application system, including false positive misstatements, and a possible lack of effectiveness if only a small part of the population used the application.
In order to prevent the dissemination of misleading or harmful “circle virus” applications, apples place restrictions on the type of organization in which coronary virus-related applications can be published in apple application stores, i.e. only in “official” or other organizations of good reputation.
Similar restrictions have been imposed in Google and the Amazon.
Privacy defenders have expressed concern about the large-scale monitoring of the use of coronary virus applications, in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure established to respond to the coronary virus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat of the epidemic has been eliminated.
AI and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations declared eight conditions to be met for government projects:
Surveillance must be “legitimate, necessary and proportionate”;
Monitoring and surveillance expansion must include sunset provisions;
Data collected for COVID-19 purposes only;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected, and there is evidence of effective protection;
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
Any data sharing with third parties should be defined by law;
Safeguards must be provided to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse;
All “relevant stakeholders” are required to “effectively participate,” including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) have also published a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan is designed to address ongoing surveillance problems and remove them from the equipment operating system as soon as tracking is no longer required.
In some countries, web-based rather than application-based location tracking has been introduced, without the need for users to download applications, while avoiding being tracked.
In Israel, web-based tracking has been approved.
Web-based solutions that can access the original location data may have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with a central server are required to access personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only communicate with one another using a central server have now been created (see below for further details).
Korea introduced a non-application-based system to carry out a contact tracking mission.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combines that information to send notifications to potential infected persons via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the Government has also been allowed to disclose location information, as the country has made significant adjustments to its information privacy laws following the outbreak of the MERS epidemic.
The public has access to this information through a number of applications and websites.
As of 6 April 2020, no specific details had been published.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy protection solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other mobile phones.
PEP-PT is a coordinated programme with a centralized and decentralized approach, not a single agreement. A decentralized agreement includes a decentralized privacy protection proximity tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), a temporary contact number (TCN, formerly the contact event number, CEN), a privacy-sensitive protocol and a mobile link tracking mechanism (PACT).
According to these agreements, identifiable personal data will never leave the equipment, and all matches will be made on the equipment.
The MIT Media Laboratory privacy team has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection techniques when collecting and using position or path cross-data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the study of the White Paper "Application Rotation: Preserving Personal Privacy in the Epidemic " , released in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally created and dedicated to the development of privacy technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses security hardware technology to support users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups jointly formed the Global TCN Alliance around essentially the same methodology and largely overlapping agreements, with the goal of reducing fragmentation information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, which is a key to achieving widespread application.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that its official government applications used the Open Source BlueTrace agreement.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controlled the Andre and iOS mobile platforms, respectively, announced a close contact tracking scheme, claiming that it combined low-power bluetooth technologies with privacy protection encryption techniques to protect privacy.
In addition, they published core technical norms used in the system.
Apple and Google state that the system is planned to be rolled out in three phases:
Introduction of tools to support governments in creating official coronary virus tracking applications that protect privacy
In order to integrate this function directly into the iOS and Andre systems, Google and Apple first launched the system through an operating system update, and subsequently removed the system in the same way as the threat of the epidemic, thus addressing the problem of follow-up monitoring.
b Drug repositioning (also referred to as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or conversion of treatment) refers to the conversion of an approved drug to another use for the treatment of a disease or medical condition that is different from its original research and development purpose.
This is a research route currently under way to develop a safe and effective cure for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and blood transfusions during the recovery period. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins available for pharmaceuticals, with multiple formulation combination sites for each protein.
The analysis of these combinations provides a sound programme for the development of effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important of the SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papaya-based protein enzymes, RNA dependent RNA polymerases, cystic enzymes, S proteins and ADP nucleic diphosphate enzymes.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several candidate compounds and then optimized and analysed the skeletal similarities of these candidate compounds against the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their pre-clinical trials and to recommend them in the clinical research design.
Chlorazine is an antimalarial drug that is also used to treat some of its own immune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that four drugs, including chloroquine and related hydroxyl chloride, would be studied as part of a unified clinical trial.
The Governor of the state of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the trials of chlorium and hydroxyl chloride in the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to allow the use of hydrazine and phosphate.
The treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA clinical trial procedure and only by EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use by patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in clinical trials.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that “use, dose or time of use of hydroxyl chloride for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not been determined.
The doctors indicated that they used the drug when they had “no choice”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the joint use of chlorazine with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
An experiment on the safety and therapeutic effects of the preventive use of hydroxyl chloride is being conducted at the Langny Medical School of the New York University.
The clinical trials conducted by China in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that Fapilawi was “manifestly effective”.
In Shenzhen, 35 patients passed negative results within an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not receive the medication were treated for 11 days.
In a study of 240 cases of pneumonia conducted in Wuhan, half received Faipilave and the other half received Abidor.
The Italian Drug Control Service reminds the public that the evidence available to support the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan as a reserve and use the military to transport the drug to the university hospital to treat the covid-19 patients in the hospital.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made a proposal to the Trump government to purchase the drug. The efficacy of the drug may be reduced in cases of severe diseases where the virus has grown.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or pre-pregnancy persons to use the drug.
A study of Lapinave/Litonavi (Kaletra) (joint use of antiviral drugs Lopinave and Litonavi) concluded that “no benefits were observed”.
These drugs are intended to suppress the reproduction of the human immunodeficiency virus (Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV) by combining it with protein enzyme.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is attempting to modulate drugs to find compounds that can be associated with SARS-CoV-2 protein enzymes. The scientific community has criticized the redirection of resources to drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included Lopinawa/Litonave in the international solidarity experiment.
Redshive is a drug created and developed by Gillid Science to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gillid Science then found that Redshive was antiviral in vitro against a wide range of filaria, pneumonia, compost and coronary viruses.
One of the problems with antiretroviral treatment is that drug resistance through mutation can lead to more serious diseases and spread.
A number of early pre-test studies suggest that Radesiwe may have high drug resistance genetic barriers. A number of clinical trials are under way, two of them at the University Hospital in Cleveland; one for moderate symptoms; and the other for more severe symptoms.
Three vitamin C intravenous clinical trials are currently under way for patients with severe inpatient diseases COVID-19; two placebo control tests (China, Canada) and one non-control test (Italy).
The State of New York started the trial of antibiotics Achimoxin on March 24, 2020.

Pregnant women, nursing mothers or women who do not use effective contraception are not eligible.
Several anticondensants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular hepatocin is widely used for the treatment of patients, prompting the Italian Drug Enforcement Authority to issue guidelines for its use.
On 14 April, Italy announced a multi-centre study of 300 patients to study the application of the preventive and curative dose of sodium iono.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the reuse of approved antiviral drugs, developed for prior outbreaks of diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS), and the West Nile virus, has generated considerable scientific attention.
Libaverin: Based on China ' s seventh edition of the Guide, it is recommended that Libavelin be used for the treatment of COVID-19
Abidal Hydrogen: Based on the seventh edition of China ' s guidelines, it is recommended that the treatment of the hydrochloric acid Abidal be used for the treatment of COVID-19.
Some of the potential reusable antibiotics that have been identified for the treatment of COVID-19:
Torrent Mono (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Tests were also carried out in Italy and China. See also Tociliizumab#COVID-19.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronary viral disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine to complete clinical trials, many attempts to develop the vaccine are ongoing.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that no vaccine against the pathogenic virus SARS-CoV-2 was expected to occur within 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines entered the I phase of the safety study.
December 2019, discovered COVID-19.
In 2020, a massive epidemic spread around the world triggered significant investment and research in vaccine development.
Many organizations are developing a possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using the virus genome that has been released.
CEPI presented its vaccine development plan in April and stated that the immediate priorities were speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were researching and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines.
The main platform targets for entering phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (I Phase Developer and Candidate Vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus carrier (I phase developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, 5 gland viral carrier)
In April, CEPI scientists reported that a total of 115 candidate vaccines were in the early stages of development, of which 78 had been identified as ongoing projects (79 according to the Mirken Institute) and 37 had been announced, but with little public information (presumed to be in the planning or design).
Initial safety and immunogen tests are performed in the I-II period, usually at random, multi-point tests against placebo, with a more precise and effective dose determined.
Phase III tests typically involve a larger number of participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose levels.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines actively developed (as of the beginning of April 2020), 74 have yet to be evaluated by the human body (still “pre-clinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular plier vaccine that could be genetically modified with viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac), University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of vaccine development with the goal of beginning human trials in 2021.

On March 12, 2020, the biotechnology company Medicago, located in Quebec City, Québec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research, viral particles of the coronary virus were developed.
Candidate vaccines are under laboratory study and are scheduled to enter human tests in July or August 2020.
Earlier in the week, the Guardian reported that United States President Donald Trump had given CureVac “a great deal of money” to obtain exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German Government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced cooperation with the German company BioNTech in the development of a mRNA-based vaccine.

On March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that they would obtain the results of pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and that their final candidate vaccines might begin human trials in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, in France, the Alliance for Innovative Epidemiological Prevention (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine research coalition comprising the Basteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in COVID-19 vaccine development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal trials of six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of Technology in London announced on March 20, 2020 that a self-enhanced RNA vaccine for COVID-19 was being developed.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the virus sequence from China.
In late 1999, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical responses to COVID-19, including numerous candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University Programs.
At about the same time, the Government of Canada announced an investment of $192 million dedicated to the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and plans to establish a national “vaccine bank”, including several new vaccines, that could be used in the event of a re-emergence of the coronary virus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of PittCoVac, a covid-19 vaccine that could be used in mice, and stated that “the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine provided by the MNA can produce a strong antigen-specific antibody reaction [of mice], which begins to appear two weeks after immunization”.
On April 16, 2020, the School of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo, Canada, announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA as a possible nose spray.
Researchers, using fungi, have designed DNA to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless viral sample particles, which may stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the United States Government, industry and three universities pooled resources and combined cloud computing resources from Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that, in addition to disease prevention, they can bring other benefits.
Further random trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 health personnel.
The vaccine under development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, to assess vaccine efficacy have shown the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and for international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there was no effective SARS treatment or preventive vaccine for human security.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a top priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. Moreover, there are no effective vaccines for MERS.
At the time of the MERS epidemic, it was felt that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed the I phase of human clinical trials, and three other vaccines are under development, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two are gland viral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is the MVA carrier vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Various social media articles fuel conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and that vaccines are available.
Patents cited in various social media articles refer to patents for other existing coronary viruses (e.g. SARS coronary virus) toxic strain genetic sequences and vaccines.
2019 The coronary virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) type of coronary virus.
Common symptoms include heat, cough and gas.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, swallow pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The lurking period from exposure to the onset of the disease ranges from 2 to 14 days, usually around 5 days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some may develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of reported cases in 210 countries and territories worldwide exceeded 2.24 million and the number of deaths exceeded 153,000.
More than 568,000 people are now rehabilitated. The virus spreads mainly between people through close contact, often by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Although air-ejection produces spores, they usually fall on the ground or on the surface of a variety of objects and do not cause long-range transmission.
In addition, if someone touches the surface contaminated by the virus and then touches his or her nose and mouth, the virus may also be infected.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on the surface of the object.
The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reversion of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test of nasal swabs.
Persons suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
The recommendations on the wearing of masks by the public varied from place to place, with some authorities opposing the wearing of masks to others.
There are currently no COVID-19 vaccines or special effects antiviral treatment programmes.
The majority of countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may be unsymptomatic and may also have symptoms of suspected influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue and gas.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory difficulties, persistent chest pain or chest palsy, confusion, difficulty of abstinence and bruises on the face or lip; if they occur, immediate medical treatment is recommended.
A few cases may be accompanied by upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, snorting or throat pain.
Different rates of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, were also monitored.
Some of the cases in China began with symptoms of chest depression and hysteria.
Some cases may develop into viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure and even death.
We call this the lurking period.
The latency period for COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may extend to 2-14 days.
97.5 per cent of infected persons experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and the report states that not all cases of infection occur.
The role of people living with an asymptomatic infection in the spread of the epidemic is not yet fully clear; however, there is prima facie evidence that people with an asymptomatic infection may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms has not yet been determined, and research is being intensified. The Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of confirmed cases do not show any symptoms during hospitalization.
Since 1 April, the National Health Council of China has included cases of asymptomatic conditions in its daily circulars; 130 (78 per cent) of the 166 infections that occurred on that day were unsymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both saliva and saliva carry a large number of viruses.
Speaking out loud is more spattering than a normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that unshielded cough could lead to the most distant transmission of 4.5 m (15 feet).
Although such viruses are generally not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States has determined that biological aerosol transmission is possible, and air collectors in the corridors outside the ward have detected positive samples of the virus RNA.
Medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may cause haemorrhage in the respiratory tract and, in turn, air transport.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through manure, but the risk is considered low. When a patient has symptoms, the virus is the most contagious; although it may spread before symptoms occur, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that, although the spread of the new coronary virus is not yet entirely clear, it is generally transmitted by one person to two or three people. The lifetime of the virus on the surface of the object varies from hours to days.
Specifically, the new coronary virus is known to survive one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99% pure copper products.
However, their lifetime is also influenced by humidity and temperature.
Soap and cleaning agents also have the effect of killing the virus if properly used. Soap products degradable the fat layer of the virus, rendering it inactive, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
A study in Hong Kong, China, showed that saliva samples were taken on average two days after admission.
The first sample of 5/6 patients had the highest viral load, while the first 6 patients detected the highest viral load the next day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new form of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-COV-2) coronary virus, first separated from three pneumonia patients in a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the natural coronary virus.
Before the virus enters the human body, it can be killed with home soap, which can destroy the virus's protective cylindrical. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through vascular tension-transform enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has the highest concentration in lung type II pulmonary cells.
The virus combines with ACE2 and enters host cells through a special surface glucose protein called "pill" (cystic particles).
Of the patients admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, 12 per cent found acute heart damage and a high percentage of patients with serious illnesses.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders caused by the worsening process, but acute cardiovascular damage may also be related to the heart ACE2 receptor.
ACE2 Receptor is highly expressed in the heart and is involved in regulating the function of the heart.
According to the information received, the high incidence of haemorrhage (31%) and hysteria hysteria (25%) among ICU-supervised people infected with COVID-19 may be related to prognosis. The autopsies of the deceased COVID-19 found widespread lung damage (DAD) and lymphocytes immersion in the lungs.
Despite SARS-COV-2 narcissism in the upper-respiratory cells expressing ACE2, CIVD-19 patients suffer from systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells in the COVID-19 patients are associated with the inflammatory IL-6 mononuclear cell collection and severe lung pathology.
The autopsy report also found lymphocytes immersed.
WHO has published several disease detection programmes.
The standard method of detection is a real-time reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test usually tests respiratory samples obtained through snorkels; however, snorting or sulfur samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available within hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be performed, but two blood samples are required to be taken at intervals of two weeks, with little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate the strain of coronary viruses and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test agent to detect infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which not only detects active infections but also detects individuals who have been infected in the past) is still under development but has not yet been extended to use.
In China's experience, the accuracy of the tests is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first immediate diagnostic reagent, which became operational at the end of the month. A diagnostic guide issued by Wuhan University’s Central and South Hospital suggests methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Early infections are most often seen in the pulmonary, filamentary glass shadow, with extra-week asymmetrical and subsequent fabrics.
As the virus evolves, there may be sub-pleasure of the pleura, gravel routing (the pneumoplasty of small leaves with varying degrees of pulmonary abundance) and physical changes in the lungs.
Very little information is available on COVID-19 micropathological injuries and pathological physiology.
The main pathological findings of the post-mortem examination were as follows:
Eye check: Pneumococcal, Carbitis, Pneumoconiosis and Pneumocoma
Four severe levels of viral pneumonia were observed:
Light pneumonia: pneumoconiosis, pulmonary cell growth, large quantities of atypical pulmonary cells, lymphocytes immersed with intertonic inflammation and the formation of multinuclear megacells
Severe pneumonia: Massive lung damage (DAD) coupled with diffuse pulmonary pulmonary leaching fluid.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Pneumonia recovery: osmosis of the pneumonic cavity and interpulmonary fibrosis
Blood: dispersive intravascular condensation (DIC); larvae-young red cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include: staying at home; avoiding access to crowd-intensive areas; regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintaining good respiratory hygiene; and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The U.S. CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing; in the absence of a paper towel, the inner side of the elbow is recommended.
It is recommended to clean the hands after coughing or sneezing.
CDC recommends wearing a mask in public, to some extent, to prevent the spread of the virus among the unsymptomatic population. The core of the strategy of maintaining social distance lies in closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public gatherings, thereby reducing the chances of infected people to engage with large groups.
In addition, the social distance guidelines provide for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 metres) in interpersonal interactions.
There are no effective medicines to prevent COVID-19. Given that it is expected that vaccines will not be developed until at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the epidemic are key to controlling COVID-19 transmission, which is what we know as the "rapid epidemiology curve."
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and tap water for at least 20 seconds, especially in the back of a toilet or when there is a clear stain on their hands, before meals and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
Also, it is recommended to use alcohol-containing hand-washing fluids of at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and running water around. In areas where it is not possible to buy water-free hand-washing fluids, WHO provides two formulations for production.
These formulations stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; peroxide is not a “hand disinfectant”.
Add glycerine as a moist agent.
People are provided with supportive care, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other affected vital organ support.
CDC recommends that suspected carriers wear a simple mask.
The in vitro Oxygen Oxygen (ECMO) has been introduced to mitigate respiratory failure symptoms, but its benefits remain to be studied.
It is recommended that personal hygiene be maintained and that healthy lifestyles and eating habits be promoted, thereby increasing immunity.
Supportive therapy may be effective for early infections of mildly ill patients. WHO and the National Health Council of China have launched an initiative calling for proper care for covid-19 patients who are admitted to hospital.
United States experts in critical pathology and lung specialists have compiled treatment proposals from agencies and made them available free of charge through IBCC.
As of April 2020, no COVID-19 special effects therapy had been developed.
For some symptoms, some medical experts suggested the use of paracetamol (Acetaminophenol) instead of Brockin for first-line treatment.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus and to complete operations that may produce aerosols in a medical environment, such as tubes or hand-held air, with particular attention to protection.
For medical personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that, in addition to standard preventive measures, exposure prevention measures, and air transport prevention measures, the patient should be transferred to the airborne infectious disease isolation unit (AIIR). The CDC provides an overview of the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the epidemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 The mask was authorized to be used in an industrial setting, but FDA has authorized the use of the mask on the basis of an emergency use authorization (EUA).
It is primarily used to prevent inhalation of suspended particles (e.g. dust), but is not used for other purposes to ensure effective isolation of specific biological agents.
If no masks are available, CDC recommends the use of masks and, if necessary, home-made masks.
Most COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms and do not require mechanical gas or other options, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Medical staff are actively conducting research to provide respiratory support to patients with covid-19 who have symptoms of respiratory failure.
It is not clear whether the two types of treatment described above will have the same effect on patients with severe illnesses.
If conditions permit, some doctors tend to use creative mechanical air, as this technology also limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-nosal flow oxygen therapy.
In many developed countries, the number of beds per person is inadequate, and the health-care system is unable to cope with the critical situation that requires hospital admissions as a result of the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, given the limitations of medical conditions.
A study in China found that 5 per cent of patients had to be sent to ICUs, 2.3 per cent had to be mechanically ventilated, and 1.4 per cent had to die as a result.
About 30% of the COVID-19 patients in China were eventually admitted to ICU.
With the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the complexity of mechanical air traffic has increased and oxygen integration has become increasingly difficult.
At that time, pressure control models and high PEP respirators will be required in order to maximize the delivery of oxygen while minimizing the risk of lung damage and gas chest damage from the respirator.
Old-style respirators may not be able to achieve high PEP.
Potential therapies have been studied since January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs are now in the clinical trial phase.
Redeswell seems to be one of the most potential drugs at the moment.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs tested have either been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing stages.
Severely ill patients may try to use antiviral drugs.
WHO calls on a wide range of volunteers to participate in potential therapy effectiveness and safety trials. The FDA has provisionally authorized plasma transfusions during recovery as experimental treatment for life-threatening patients.
The necessary clinical studies have not yet been carried out to demonstrate whether the treatment is safe and effective in treating the disease.
In February 2020, China released a mobile application to contain outbreaks.
Users are required to enter their names and identification numbers as required.
This application allows for the detection of “close contact” through monitoring data, which in turn makes it possible to determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
Once potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-segregation, but also alerts local health officials. A combination of cellular data big data analysis, facial recognition techniques, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and their contacts in Korea, Taiwan, China, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of persons suspected of carrying the coronary virus.
The aim of this measure is to enforce segregation and to protect groups that may be exposed to infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, German telecommunications shared aggregated mobile phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute of the Federal Government of Germany in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deploys facial recognition techniques to detect persons who violate the rules of isolation.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, noted that mobile phone operators' data indicate that “40 per cent of citizens are still moving around”.
The German Government organized a 48-hour weekend hacker marathon, with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for innovative solutions on a global scale to prevent the spread of the coronary virus.
Segregation, mobility restrictions, treatment of side effects or fear of self-infection can be disturbing.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connell's argument that “social isolation, isolation, health anxiety, stress and economic depression are perfect storms that harm people's mental health and well-being”.
The disease is milder and the symptoms rarely or even show symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Minor cases can normally recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
According to other similar viruses (e.g. SARS and MERS), pregnant women are at higher risk of developing to CIVD-19 patients with severe illnesses, but lack data support for COVID-19. COVID-19 may have an impact on the lungs of some of the population, leading to pneumonia.
In the most affected areas, COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, schizophrenic shock or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19 related complications include sepsis, condensation abnormalities, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
6% of the COVID-19 admitted patients suffered condensation abnormalities, in particular the prolonged period of the coagulation enzyme, while 4% of the group suffered kidney abnormalities.
About 20-30% of the COVID-19 patients have an elevated liver enzyme (rotamino enzyme).
According to the same report, the average time between morbidity and death is 10 days, with an average of five days of hospitalization.
However, the average time that a patient transferred to ICU is admitted to hospital until death is seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time between the onset of early symptoms and death was 14 days, with an overall time range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Council of China (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
A pathological examination of the tissues of the autopsy lung samples showed that both pulmonary pulmonary pervasive pulmonary damage was accompanied by cellular fission mucus samples.
virulent cytopathology was observed in pulmonary cells.
The lung image is similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the deaths reported by China ' s National Health Council, 11.8 per cent resulted from heart damage caused by higher calcium protein levels or sudden heart arrest.
According to data released in March in the United States, 89% of admitted patients have a history of past illness. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
Due to regional differences and methodological difficulties, disease mortality estimates differ.
Underestimating cases of minor disorders can lead to overestimation of mortality.
However, if a case of death is caused by a previous infection, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop into serious COVID-19 patients and 2.4 times more likely to be in need of intensive care or death. There are concerns about the long-term consequences of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority in China found a 20 to 30 per cent drop in lung activity among some of the recovering, and lung scans showed organ damage.
In addition, post-rehabilitation post-surveillance syndrome may be faced.
As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether past infections will lead to effective long-lasting immunization for those recovering from the infection.
The behavioural characteristics of other coronary viruses were identified as potentially immune, but some COVID-19 cases were reported to have tested positive for coronary viruses shortly after recovery.
These cases are considered to be cases of continuous infection worsening rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be a natural virus, originating in animals and infected by spilling over.
The actual origin has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the extent of the infection was almost entirely interpersonal.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published by the Lancet in January 2020 showed that the earliest date of occurrence was 1 December 2019.
The earliest outbreak reported in the WHO official publication was December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment programmes, the time of the first outbreak, and age, gender and overall state of health.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infectious deaths, U07.2 to clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed infections COVID-19 but undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 deaths.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include case mortality (CFR) as a percentage of the number of diagnosed deaths and infection mortality (IFRs) as a percentage of the number of diagnosed deaths, and disease deaths as a percentage of the number of infected (including the number of diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow the entire process from infection to case resolution of a particular population.
While not all infected persons are immune, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of infected persons.
The Italian Epidemic Center Castigliene d'Adda, a small town with a population of only 4600, has 80 (1.7 per cent) died of the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the epidemic spread through various carnival days, reaching even young people, but the mortality rate is relatively low and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
In addition, the German medical system is overburdened.
Blood donors assessed that about 3 per cent of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0.004 per cent of the total population) have been identified as having died in COVID-19.
The effects of the epidemic and mortality rates vary by sex.
Studies in China and Italy show that mortality rates are higher among men than among women.
The risk of death is highest among men between the ages of 50 and 60, with only 90 years of age with a similar gender gap.
China has a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not yet clear, but may be due to genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender-based differences in immunology, with lower rates of smoking among women, combined diseases (e.g. hypertension) are lower among men than among women, resulting in higher mortality rates among men than among women.
In Europe, 57 per cent of men are infected and 72 per cent of the total number of deaths due to COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the United States Government has not tracked sex-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola virus, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of female health workers, especially nurses, is higher, as is the probability of exposure to the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease was officially named "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus, explained this: CO is the “crowd”, VI is the “virus”, D is the “disease”, and 19 is the first outbreak of the epidemic (31 December 2019).
The name was chosen in order to avoid citing specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or population groups, in line with the international recommendation to prevent stigmatization. The virus that caused COVID-19 is known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) type.
In addition, WHO uses the “COVID-19 virus” and the “COVID-19 virus” in mass communication.
Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as “circumculatory viruses”.
During the first outbreak of the disease in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were widely referred to as “circumculatory viruses” and “circumculatory viruses”.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as temporary viruses and disease names, in accordance with the 2015 Guidelines for the Use of Locations in Disease and Virus Names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun printing health-care materials, such as snout and respirator components.
For example, an Italian hospital was in dire need of ventilation valves, the supplier could not deliver the components within the required time, a local start-up company undertook reverse work and printed 100 ventilation valves overnight.
Following the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease spread rapidly through the network.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
No evidence of copying of the virus was found in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research to develop vaccines and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “Solidarity Experiment” to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds, which are currently most likely to have therapeutic effects.
There is currently no vaccine, but institutions at all levels are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells via ACE2 receptors, the previous work done by SARS-CoV needs to be used.
Three vaccine strategies are being studied.
First, researchers plan to develop an all-virus vaccine.
The purpose of the use of such viruses, whether non-active or dead, is to provoke rapid human immune responses in the event of new infections of COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop subunit vaccines aimed at developing a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such studies focused on the S puncture protein of the ACE2 enzyme receptor assisted by the virus.
The third strategy is the development of a nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and effectiveness of the pilot vaccines developed in the above strategies must be tested. On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first clinical trial of the vaccine.
Vaccines contain an innocuous gene sequence that reproduces disease-induced viruses. It is disputed that antibody dependency enhancement may be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials had been conducted.
Seven tests were evaluated and approved for use in the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydrochlorinated naphthalenes or chloroquine.
The conversion of antiviral drugs accounted for the vast majority of Chinese research, and nine three-stage clinical trials on Red Silvee will be conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and candidate drugs has been initiated. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently being assessed, including Radesive, chlorazine and hydrochlorine, Lopinave/Litonave and Lopinave/Litonave combinations of interferon beta.
As of March 2020, the efficacy of the treatment at Red Silvee had been initially confirmed.
It was observed that the clinical symptoms of patients treated with a compassionate drug, Redshive, were alleviated.
At this stage, the US, China, and Italy are conducting III clinical trials. In February 2020, China launched a chlorazine (used in the past to treat malaria) study with preliminary results.
However, a call was made for a peer review of the study.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommended the use of chlorazine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Veterinary Research recommended 1 gram a day, while warning that twice the dose was very dangerous and possibly lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for the use of chlorazine and hydrazine, but the doctor has the right to decide whether to treat the COVID-19 patients with these two drugs. China’s seventh edition of the guide also proposes to treat COVID-19 with jammers, Libavelin, or amitor hydrochloride.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of Libavelin are in vitro inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.
After confirming the low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, further in vivo studies are recommended using nitronit. Studies have shown that the raw puncture protein caused by the trans-menoplasty 2 (TMPRSS2) is a necessary condition for SARS-COV-2 interaction with the ACE2 receptor into the human body.
There are serious limitations in the studies of chlorazine and hydrochlorine, whether or not used in conjunction with Achimoxin, and the medical community cannot accept these treatments unless further research takes place. Ostaway has no in vitro inhibition to SARS-CoV-2 and has not been found to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19.
Cell factor storms can become complications in the post-treatment of serious patients with COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydrazine may have anti-cell-factor storm properties. After completing a small study, the National Health Council of China has included the toad resistance in its treatment guidelines.
Following positive results for patients with severe illnesses, Italy is conducting a national 2-stage non-random test.
In combination with sero-protein blood testing, the identification of cell-based storms is designed to contain the development of the disease, which is thought to cause the death of some of the infected.
In 2017, with the support of retrospective case studies, the FDA approved the use of white cytocyte 6 for the treatment of steroid intransigent cytopathological syndrome, known as CART cytotherapy, caused by other causes.
To date, there has been no random cross-reference to evidence of effective treatment of the CRS.
Pure enriched antibodies from the CIVD-19 immune system are currently being studied and injected to people in need of antibodies as passive immune therapy, pending successful vaccine development.
This strategy was tried during the SARS epidemic, but the efficacy of the treatment is uncertain.
The virus is a mechanism for the expected effects of the passive antitherapy guide SARS-CoV-2 immuno-defence.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibodies dependent cytotoxicity and/or ingestion, can achieve the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of man-made monoclon antibodies, are being developed.
The serum is made up of the liquid part of the blood of the recovering patient, which includes a specific antibodies against the virus.
Coronary virus disease, a closely related syndrome.
Dr. Lee Wen-Ling, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, raised awareness of the spread of the new coronary virus, which was unfortunately infected with COVID-19 and died.
