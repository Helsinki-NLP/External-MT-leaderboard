This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but shows details that fossils as a rule do not have the opportunity to show, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feather suit of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but have other functions for feathers  counter-hooks and shelves , the researchers assumed that rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, such as the other relevant functions.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a dinosaur, the sample showed the feather suit of an adult and not a chicken's dune.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Skytten galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects the gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects the Skytten galaxy with its forces.
The researchers came to the conclusion that dark matter acts on other dark matter in a similar way to ordinary matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is around the galaxy in a kind of glory, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: the voters go into a box alone, lay a sheet of paper with a preset print that indicates their candidate's choice in a convolut.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter releases the envelope into the voting boxes and signs the voter's call.
French electoral law has quite a stringent codification of the legal proceedings.
Since 1988, the voting boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that no convoluted ballot papers are present at the start of the vote and that no convoluted ballot papers are added except for those who are properly spoken and approved.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process.

In the women's sitting group, there were four skiers who failed to complete the race, and 45 of the 117 competitors in the women's storslalom failed to advance.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The local police inspector general, D K Arya, said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and her portable computer".
The targeted are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
"Sighted appeared in court with covered faces", said Chandra Shekhar Solanki, a police officer.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The needy helped the driver out of the red Audi TT, while the street where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed.
He was initially placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been prosecuted in Edinburgh's court for killing his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitnesses may have been affected since her picture has been much in the public eye.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, so that courts consider the publication of images as potentially harmful to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes that journalists seem to be hanging in a thin thread if they publish pictures etc. of suspects.
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overseen responsibility for prosecution, that no further comments will be made before the prosecution.
The document is supposed to refer to the border divisions, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the themes that were taken up.
Israel requires continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to allow this strength to remain for only five years.
The shooting of the supplementary skirmish was closely monitored by the forest rangers, which led to the monitoring of the case and the evaluation of its effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and legacy at NPWS, the four shooters for the first shooting operation received safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new election council (CEP) of 9 members yesterday.
It's actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the earlier CEP-expiration (Haiti's election commission) as part of a package of measures to drive the country towards new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations arose due to the lack of elections, some with declines since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, and have caused a total of six fires and given four persons with minor fire injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been clear over 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (19:19.
The Northern Marianas crisis management office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication that a tsunami was coming.
A Filipino man who previously served as a police officer has held tourists in Hong Kong as prisoners by hijacking their bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the old, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
After each photographer took the seat of an old woman when she needed the toilet, Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a medical career.
He graduated to maternity hospital and in 1959 began working at Auckland's national women's hospital.
Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time, while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would increase the speed of development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that state investigators picked up two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other brewers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first boss, Luna died on the night of two moons, quite unique, just like her, strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was as cute as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed in the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the polling population shares this view, and wants Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's last monarch.
In the opinion poll, 29% of Australians think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim both 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three stages during the Commonwealth Games, but due to complaints, his form has begun to be questioned.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, it was reported Tuesday.
Comets were perhaps the cause of water on Earth, as well as ecological matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially with respect to Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as politisk skravling and stupidity.
There is speculation about whether he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and forminous carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to older ground-based technology that makes it possible for air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is put in, trains over the ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The possibility of being forced to play behind closed doors without the team's support players was raised as a result of fears of lack of transport.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden informed that new species had developed in just two generations, although many believed that this process would take much longer due to the breeding of endemic Darwinfink, Middle Earth Purple, and the kaktus purple-immigrant Storkaktus purple.
Gold can come in all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can also be twinned and braided.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used as a decoration in the hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical pH. You can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Kåljuice will change color completely depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The PH level is marked by how many hydrogenions (H in pH) are present in the chemical that was tested.
Hydrogenions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms are one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels weird, and it creates a kind of shell.
Nearly all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water closets that were connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of the water system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, there were also toilets in Egypt, Persia, and China.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down again, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 British feet to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in great ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a means of transportation that is much simpler and faster.
It has given us many transportation devices such as the train, the car and more.
Below them, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized byte animals that hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are several small pusekats (including loose kittens) that eat the far more numerous byte animals, such as insects, gnagers, owls, and birds.
The secret to success is the niche concept, a special job that every cat has, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and they live together in larger groups called alliances.
The alliances consist of 13 adult males who are in a relationship, along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion's pack behaves much the same way as a wolf or dog pack, animals that have surprisingly much in common with the behavior of lions (but not with other large cats).
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger roar is not like the adult roar of a lion, but more like a sentence with whining words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals, and they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can.
Researchers believe that the ozelot follow and find animals to eat (by-catch) by smelling, sniffing on the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came, if they move over a mountain area or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different functions or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population hasn't changed, they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the new people begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they look less and less like the other population.
After a few thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We've called this process species formation, which just means the breeding of new species, and species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (so it's just breathing out).
Plants take their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and animals wouldn't survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, which was not afraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 silky sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper mouth, none that crossed its way came alive from it.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had the wrong tongue, and it could have had turtles, it could have had big fish, it could have had other mosaics, and it could have been a cannibal.
In addition, it attacked everything that came down in the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not be any match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual food items, including wild pigs, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a seabird.
The fact that poor men and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, while the rich men liked to have banquets together where they sat on the side while eating their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that came to Europe from the United States or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no older Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built up a primordial temple to each god and these were seen as the home of God.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open yard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not so essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived mostly outdoors.
The women made the cooking in the garden; the shops were only open disks pointing out towards the street.
There were no large forests in the land areas around Canaan, which made the timber extremely expensive.
In Norse sagas, Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and then they found Greenland while traveling west and named it Greenland.
But there were Eskimo tribes living there at the time, regardless of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though all the countries were skandinaviske.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Despite the fact that it is written on the back of the document, it is not a tax map.
The text can be seen at the bottom of the document, up and down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for preservation.
So the mark was probably added as a label.
The invasion and the following battles on D-day liberated North-Frankrike, but South-Frankrike was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French Vichy individuals, French individuals who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The invasion of 15 August 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large population that lives and works together as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, linked to the Latin civis, which means inhabitant, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this defines thus on a certain scale the size of society.
A civilization culture presupposes the passing of knowledge through several generations, a linguistic footprint and fair communication that lasts.
Minor cultures disappear as a rule without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not seen as proper civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with the Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judicial system, it was dependent on state authorities, which usually were not willing to cooperate to enforce their actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax law and tariffs between the states.
The articles needed unanimous approval from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took so lightly on the central government that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fekting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and Formula 1 are well-liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the world's 7th largest island!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in geographical context, as a øygruppe.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 14th century, when European seafarers who passed by gave the island the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and began a repositioning of the native peoples' grain-production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice fields and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north under control in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which ceded Taiwan's rights to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three important structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was finished in 1976 and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still photography in the world, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is that the digital camera's image sensor formats have inherited the size ratio of the camera.
It may be a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (division with twelve to contain the simplest integer ratio), is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS family formats) are equal, or approximate equal to the aspect ratio.
The rules of the third are often misused and often ridiculed, but are a simple guideline that creates dynamics while at the same time having a goal for the order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main motif is at the point of intersection between lines that divide the image into three horizontal and vertical segments (see example).
The Catholic church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined during this period of European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority affected everyone, from kings to common people.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to formine pain and poverty and that is why the money of the church is there.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this power and money concentration caused many to question whether this principle was followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated that the effect of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, even if the blockade violated the generally accepted international law that is codified through several international agreements in the last two centuries.
Britain bombed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the sea, and creates danger for even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a corresponding response to its unrestricted submarine warfare, as there was limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most inhabitants and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing all the fear and cruelty of war during World War I, nations would avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison's firm in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a poembook and a reference letter from Charles Batchelor (the job-leader from his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces, the best-known of these periods being the three Kingdoms that took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was a fierce warfare between many kings who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died fighting for the throne of the great Xiadel Palace.
There are some social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation is governed by its inhabitants rather than by just one ruler.
Even after the revolution, it was open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and prosperous to succeed.
The same was true of the defense, because instead of military ranking systems that were based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was the motivation for other oppressed people in the working class of other nations to also set in motion their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the mortal world, and often used a cave known as Hira on the mountain Noor (light), where he went to think.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through the years, provides a very vivid representation of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountain top north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It's actually not easy to find at all, even though you know it exists, and once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The only one of the seven wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza nekropolis in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, includes many pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinxen.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The Oppstrøk symbol is similar to a V and the nedstrøk symbol is similar to a stift or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start on the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start on the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more determined.
You can use a pencil and make your own mark, but don't forget that the printed bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be taken into account.
The infamous king's house, King Ludwig XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese at 11 and Ludvig-Charles at 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were pressed to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
The king and queen returned to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened them.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows completely open.
A member of the band swung at one point the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people had to pay for the cost of the war's American imperialism, in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to impose taxes on the American colonial regime to cover large parts of the costs, and the interest on bonds was paid by the Philippine government via the Wall Street banks.
The superincome from the exploitation of the Filipino people was a fundamental gain of the United States imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the establishment of the order.
The age at which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history, which is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the early Middle Ages and were followed by the late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire did not mix with the culture and traditions of society for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, which led to more systematic, centralized and uniformed rules.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general views: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has effects on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that the development of roads is due to the car.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable if it is only used by a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to formine costs by means of transportation.
Mass vehicle ownership creates more accidents on roads, which has led to new methods being found in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romantism had a larger element of cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
What characterized the romantic was that the landscape shaped individuals and that over time geographical habits and cultures arose, and that these when they harmonized with the position in society, were better than randomly imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of fashion now in our time, Constantinople was seen as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known to be an episenter for luxury from about 400 to around 1100 CE.
The status was not the same in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more prized than the bysantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of motehovedstad was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But because of slow communication channels, styles in the West could hang on for 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, and one of the biggest changes that came about at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began using buttons to close clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-storage farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses stored seeds that belong to the area combined with growth rotation or other techniques to maximize the yield that is relatively simple.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in self-fertilization farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Part cultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out of the social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be special because of their members' age, ethnicity, class, area and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership by a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the significance of socialization is to take as a starting point the few unfortunate cases of children who through neglect, accident or intentional abuse were not sufficiently socialized by adults during their growth.
Some wild children have been held captive by humans, usually their own parents, in some cases due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical weaknesses.
It is possible that children who are wild may have undergone serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to flee.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When a wild child is completely raised by animals, it develops behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the animal that is raising it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, building stills takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool that supports individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as by using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
A teacher can also be, in other words, a kind of a teacher, but it's also the little bindersman in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions are built into the software and are meant to ask questions, encourage, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to exploitation.
No child should need to grow up in an atmosphere that is not caring and educational, but it does happen.
We see the foster system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities they did not have in the home they came from.
It's a combination of elements of both mass and interpersonal communication on the Internet.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, learning and socialization are considered important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified personal engagement and permanent relationships as new motivation aspects when they investigated the public's reactions to websites (1998).
Using video recordings, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that one can find out whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his newspaper, The President's Tale, how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity in a correct way.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genvariation and the selection removes it from the selection of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination alternate back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to what humans have to get adequate amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savanna.
And the consequences of not doing so are enormous: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would be the most readily available plant resources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them first.
Animal foods (moles, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
We shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem using a method very similar to the one the chimpanzees in the savannah use today.
Sleep breakdown is the process of conscious awakening during the normal sleep period while falling asleep again shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a rather quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known watering agent) before sleeping, and this leads to having to stand up to urinate.
How much inner calm a person has is inversely correlated with how much tension there is in body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All humans have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stops us from gaining that insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded to include the love direction of the Mahayana and several methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and full love.
Kundalini energy can be awakened with kundalini yoga through yoga positions, breathing training, mantras and visualization.
Tibetan meditation is about god-yoga, the energy channels are cleansed by the visualization of various deities, and the chakras are activated and the consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and be really fought, by proxy armies on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places in Africa to Asia.
By 17.09.1939 the Polish defence was already broken, and the last opportunity was to return and reorganise along Romania.
These plans were however abandoned almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Russian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Peace Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this, with the Americans trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
The German Navy attempted to stop this traffic, mostly with the use of submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It started with ancient cultures and tribes keeping them from easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Inner-country goats were generally kept in herds that walked on hills or other places for grazing, usually taken care of by goat herders who were often children or youths, in common with the more well-known herder.
Wagonways in England were made as early as the 1500s.
Although the wagonways consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull themselves to achieve greater speeds and pull more load than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
To keep the tracks in place, the cross was introduced quite early, but little by little it was realized that the tracks were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the strykejernet created more slitasje on the trehwheels in the wagons.
In 1767, the first full-iron skinners were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation, and humans began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, were not usually upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked with 2 legs as early as 7 million years ago, and it is discovered to have specialized in fossils at Australopithecus from 4,23,9 million years ago.
We can start by having a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to some extent to mitigate the pain that is coming.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want to have a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem, and we need to eliminate it.
The world has changed greatly from human scientific and technological advances, and difficulties have become more complicated because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and General Secretary Charles Thomson and then sent some quarters away to the printing press to John Dunlap after its introduction by Congress on July 4.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night and these are now known as Dunlap-bredsides.
The first public reading of the document was at John Nixon's garden at Independence Hall on July 8.
One came to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document, and the first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and live on to this day. They are called birds.
Some people don't think of them as real dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with shells and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
So almost all the PCs that are used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are referred to as binary digits  or bits, to use data jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are generally not sufficient for immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be that you find open medicine containers or toxic household items on the spot.
For first aid guidance specifically for the relevant poison, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this income group.
This name derives from an ancient association with midd, insects that are highly adapted to attack humans.
Both Assassin and Bed insects are nidicolous, adapted to living in the nest or house of their host.
As far as we know, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or the child's, to raise a child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method.
Experimentation is not alone, however, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions.
Naturalistic and philosophical writers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all things science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek knowledge became weaker, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that can be seen in physiology and behavior are usually entirely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been demonstrated by virtually all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and not just as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first proposals to suggest that DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or in other words viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two attempts to mark either the DNA in the radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the mutation type, the significance of the genetic material being affected and whether the cells being affected are bacterial cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, watching birds, visiting parks, and investigating details of the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village, and the others drive out.
In this dynamic transportation, everyone is somehow connected, and supporters of, a transportation system that is based on private cars.
Science shows that the great carbon economy has loosened the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridges falling down are rare.
Why do transportation systems generate such discontent, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is complicated to study traffic flow, since it is impossible to predict the behaviour of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
The driver is fortunate enough to behave with some consistency so that the traffic flow is fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To show the flow in traffic better, relationships have been established between three important properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of vehicle installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape from enemies, find food, and mate.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings backward along the body.
Because of this, they have several small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are their eye-tickers and citizen flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the world's largest and second longest river, flowing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, being ten kilometres wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows out of the students on the land and into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main river is the Amazon River, which is 6 387 km (3 980 km) long and collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although pyramids were still built in stone until the end of the ancient Egyptian Empire, they never exceeded the size and technical performance of the pyramids at Giza.
Egyptians from the New Kingdom in ancient times wondered about the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by the Vatican in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used in the daily lives of state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every inhabitant of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times, since they are all found in their natural form in nature and because they are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had theories that everything involves a mixture of one or more of the four elements of the earth.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in the same order): all-pervading, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, you also have metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that a few trillion of them fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a great help to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been considered to be of lesser status and use.
People are now writing messages on PC screens, and never getting close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that to make a nucleus with more protons and neutrons, energy is required.
It's like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart more or less unprovoked.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust.
The stern is around 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the long side.
Thinner under the maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible that there's more magma on the opposite side, because the crust is thinner, and it's easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about individuals that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's needs hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Usually, two behaviors emerge when leaders start leading their former colleagues, one part of the spectrum trying to remain "one of the crowd".
For this type of leader it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary measures, perform performance evaluations, assign responsibility and hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels he or she has to change absolutely everything that the team has done and make it theirs.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often ends in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards for excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have more self-government than regular team members, as their teams can meet in many different time zones, which the local leadership may not always understand.
A usynlig team that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique element in a virtual team.
The invisible group is the management group to which each member reports.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and new thinking can arise.
The process where an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to new innovative processes that can help to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create an innovation culture and share knowledge and organisational expertise.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a way to provide assistance to organizations to improve performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical documentation for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition.
The interaction between brain pathology and behavior is a confirmation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
Brain structures and processes that we have never seen before are now possible to study thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our brains.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) gives a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, handling behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about making machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control and planning of the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on coming up with solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and defense, which is built into several home PCs and computer game software.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and teachers usually like to take students to places where a bus tour is not possible.
Technology offers the possibility of a solution with virtual excursions, where students can observe museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire great art while sitting with their class.
A great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes is to share the excursion virtually.
For example, students from the Bennet school in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the capital, each year the website is restructured, but old versions are kept on the web to be used as a cutout book.
While students often start their blogging experience with slurred grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience will generally change that.
The blog author began to improve his writing to avoid criticism, since students are often the most critical audience.
Blogging also forces students to be more up-to-date on the world around them.
Blogging is a tool that motivates students to work together and encourages them to expand their learning beyond the typical school day they've been used to.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students to think more analytically and critically; through active reaction to internet materials, students can define their positions in connection with others, as well as sketch their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present-day.
To the south lies the Niagara Falls, and to the north, in Muskoka and beyond, you find untouched nature in all its beauty.
All of this and more shows what Ontario considers to be true Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely populated and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A comparison of the population that surprises many: There are more Afro-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury holiday destinations.
The Arabs brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Kapp route from Europe to India.
In the northern region it is bordered by the Sahel, in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that traveling ladies disclose that they are married, whatever the actual civil status is.
It's also useful to go with a ring (but not one that looks too animal-looking.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they will see as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, that still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know today as Casablanca was founded in the tenth century before our Common Era, and was used as a strategic port under the name Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, leaving it abandoned after a 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan built the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca because of the Spanish merchants who had established their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping locations in all of Morocco.
Places where traditional Moroccan goods can be bought, such as tagins, ceramics, leather goods, hattegens and a whole spectrum of geia, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are sold mainly to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the eastern vicinity of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava coming from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which led to the demolition of most of the city's streets, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is quite safe, all visits outside Goma should be read about in advance to understand the fighting taking place in the North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing up the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the most reasonable mountain tours to see gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, combined with relative unavailability.
Although Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Because of the threat from the desert sand, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990.
It was one of the big stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River is the southern boundary.
The park is 19 500 km2 and can be divided into 14 different ecoregions, which support different kinds of wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and is considered the greatest national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card (a ticket), which gives access to either a selection of parks, or all national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider to be their main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline in Hong Kong has been compared to a gleaming stolpediagram that is clearly shown thanks to the waters that make up Victoria Harbor.
If you want the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to Kowloon's waterfront across the street.
The largest part of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on rebuilding land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest beach zone on the planet is the Sundarbans, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and the Indian coast.
The Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the forest is part of the Indian territory.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps. Here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle, which once covered the gigantic plains.
The Sundarbans consists of an area of 3,850 km2 with about one third of the area covered by water and myrtle.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30 000 Aksishjort in the area.
Buses run from the bus terminal (over the river) throughout the day, despite the fact that most, especially those buses that go east over and to Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese shuttle buses, both comfortable and reliable, serve most of the districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to places in the vicinity such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a skråkabel bridge that spans the Oyapok River and connects Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres high and have two spans of 3,50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen metres.
It is planned that the bridge will be in full operation from September 2017, when the Brazilian tolls checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní group, they were semi-nomadic hunters, but agriculture was also their livelihood.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and the payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly known as the Giant Provinces of the Indies, became a country as a result of the Spanish conquest of the native peoples.
The colonization period lasted for 3 centuries and was started by the Spanish.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its place's character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, on the poloban in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See Asosiacion Argentina de Polo for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official Falklands currency, if value is set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there, while it's winter in the northern part of the planet and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; in the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common.
The cold can be misleading about winter as the temperature rarely goes below the freezing point, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There is no particular rain time and dryer seasons:-the rainfall is the same throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but still, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
You should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves according to the park authority, and 25 yards from any other wildlife!
Bison, elk, deer, bears and almost any large animal can attack no matter how peaceful they may look.
Every year, tens of thousands of visitors are injured because they haven't kept proper distance.
Be in addition obsessed with the fact that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking luscious meals and keep a clean slate.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port in 1889, it became the infamous site of the sea protest.
Except for one British cruiser, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting led to the murder of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are several beaches in Auckland's two harbours, the most popular being three.
The North Shore beaches in the North Harbor district are located in the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central-Auckland.
Sometimes you find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The most important local beer is Nummer en, which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better to travel.
The local water from the spring is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of flat white coffee is foreign, a short black is espresso, cappuccino comes with flour (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa lives up to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and there are rarely any damage caused by any of these things.
Nevertheless, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and follow safety warnings carefully.
Boksmanets occur in the vicinity of beaches and near rivers from October to April north of 1770.
There are sharks, but it's unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean, but their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the wavering peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although there may be opportunities to book lodging in other areas, such as at a camping site, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies sell mostly package solutions including breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even package combinations with airplanes and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or obtain other documents for your agreement (e.g. visa).
Various changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival guards decide to camp on the spot, and most guards consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where it's happening, you have to come early to get a campground close to the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late at night even if the music on the main stage is finished.
On some festivals there are special camping areas for small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as driving through ice creates an extremely high noise level for those most affected.
Cruise to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests, and windows and clocks are usually absent and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment for the guests, so that they are in a good mood and want to stay on the premises.
Some arenas offer free alcoholic beverages, but alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who drives in the height or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or cold.
Friction is low, so on icy and snowy roads you can't drive like you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, there may be enough snow to make you fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, in many countries, conditions of ice and snow are normal, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that attracts tourists to Africa and is the main point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips to land to see the great African wildlife, specifically the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow good viewing angles.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be quite shy and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a buskvandring, or balancevandring) involves walking for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24.08.2021 to 05.09.2021. Some events will be held elsewhere around Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first being the 1964 Summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could be in trouble.
The cancellation rules vary, but since the end of March, the cancellation rules will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130 000, and typical tickets with prices around ¥7000.
It may help to iron wet clothes to get them dry. Many hotels have a iron and ironing board available for loans, even if it is not in the room.
If a hair dryer is unavailable or you want to avoid wearing stretched socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the substance (which can cause cramping, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters are different in terms of efficiency, and if you're in doubt, you can buy the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may come across contagious animal diseases that they do not know from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or carry on infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that are capable of harming or killing humans with their power, are usually not qualified as plague.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased at certain places.
Travellers to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging conditions for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway are the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often goes through isolated backwoods.
If you are unfamiliar with road traffic, keep your head cool: there are many steep climbs, narrow roads and sharp curves.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections, usually 3540 miles per hour (5664 km/h) and it is even more important to respect them than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other places along the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery is very tasty. In Bavaria, it is rich and varied, and can be compared to the bakery of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, with baked apples year-round, and cherry and plum have their entrance in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts that grow on trees.
If you want some small, but full pastries, try what depending on the area is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid you have in, a curry can either be dry, or moist.
In the Indian subcontinent, yoghurt is regularly used in curries, while coconut milk is common in South India and some other coastal regions.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a paraply designation, covering a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the nation.
If it is used without additional pointing points, however, the term usually means food originally coming from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now much available throughout the island group, the Javanese cuisine is characterized by easy-to-cream dishes, with a predominant taste of peanuts, chili, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stigbøyler hangs down on each side of the hall and are supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but may be less secure due to the possibility of a rider being sitting down.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot stuck in the stigbøylen, he can be dragged after the horse if it runs away.
Most riders use riding boots with heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some halls, especially English halls, have safety bars that cause the leather of the steeple to fall down from the hall if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as South America's Yosemite, with many large walls and granite knobs.
The top climb offers stunning views from the mountain tops. Climbers from all over the world make ever-new routes in the endless seas of mountain walls.
The snowport in outback, which includes both ski and snowboard, is a popular sport that involves driving down snow-covered areas with ski or snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as skibomser, who plan entire holidays around skiing at a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depict skiers dating back to as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing dates back to at least the 16th century, and in 1861 the first freeride-based ski club was opened by northerners in Australia.
Backpacking on ski: This activity also has other names such as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not include, alpine style skiing, or alpine climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and then much more stiff skiing and boots are needed.
Think of a ski slope as something like a hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than if you were walking  but it is very rare that you will achieve high speeds without heavy backpacks in track.
Europe is a fairly small continent, but it has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, a journey through several nations will mean more visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, functions as one country in this respect.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control points again.
At the same time, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country if you have a Schengen visa, and you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal explanation for what kind of produced items are antiques. Some tax authorities consider items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, including that the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiquities despite being newer than equivalent mass-produced products.
Reinsdyrhold is an important bread of life among the Samas and also important for the trading culture of many with other professions.
Although not all Samis have been involved in reinsurance on a large scale, they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, while reinsurance was mostly used as a draught animal.
Today, many of the Sami people work in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although the word Gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Rumenians, it is often viewed as unflattering because of its associations with negative stereotypes and untrue impressions of the Romanian people.
If you are issued travel advice about the country you plan to travel to, it may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult other authorities than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example might be that American citizens in the Middle East encounter other situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and simple compared to the more detailed information elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all very serious weather phenomena with potential to cause serious social consequences or loss of human life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of weather affecting their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries considered to be war zones should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "environmentally hostile courses" will likely give you the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involves acting, some first aid and occasionally training with weapons.
It is common with books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning gender-correcting operations abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the journey home.
The government's willingness to issue passes where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to fit with a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the time after 11 September 2001, searches at security control points have also become far more demanding.
Preoperative transgender people must not count on being able to get through the scans with privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the reversible flow of waves that break on the beach, a reef or similar.
Based on the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated to some deeper sections, and a fast stream so that deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue during attempts to swim back against the current, which can be very problematic.
Once you get out of the current itself, it's no more problematic than normal to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be dragged back in or, depending on your skill and whether you've been noticed, you might wait to be rescued.
A returschoke occurs earlier than a culturschoke (the stress phase is not there in the same way as at outflow), it lasts longer, and can become more serious.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their own culture again.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits of your home culture.
When you first travel abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, since they know that you have to adjust to a whole new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things in the area for kids is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here all the time. The story of the sound and the light is just like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is set both as a background and as a narrative of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The Sørland-shet islands, which were found in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The largest of these is the King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the overflowed caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then emerge again to form the 360 km long mountain chain known as the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota ice sheet.
Mount Vinson has a height of 4892 metres and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, in the northern part of the Sentinel Range.
In remote areas with a lack of mobile coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot usually replace a mobile phone, as one must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to take a phone.
The service is often used by ships, freight boats and, in addition, on expeditions that have remote data and contact needs.
You can obtain more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Traveling education is an increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a year off.
This is especially popular among Russians, so they can take a year off before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a holiday abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually, a school office is required to register for this type of educational programme.
Finland is a great destination for the boat-going. The land of a thousand lakes has thousands of islands too, in the lakes and in the coast-skjærgården.
There is no need for a yacht in the island groups and lakes.
Although the coastline and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
The boat life is a national time-travel in Finland with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Although this is similar for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinct Baltic Cruisers had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of whole days in the historic city, and go back to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's nothing different from other things that a lot of people fear or dislike.
Understanding how the plane works and what happens when flying can help some to overcome a fear of the unknown or of not having control.
Freight companies get a lot of money for delivering things quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for a speedy repair.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but for smaller companies it was problematic.
If they were shipping things by air, it might have taken days on some routes to get through the loading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without passengers, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to fork out a big pile of money for the privilege (or even better, get your company to do it for you).
This, however, is not going to be fair: as a rule of thumb, you can prepare yourself to pay up to four times the standard economy rate for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for business discounts or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of flyers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova.
The multiethnic Republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994 this conflict led to the establishment of the self-appointed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any of the UN's member states.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million.
Smyrna was formerly an old city, but is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center surrounded by a large bay and mountains.
The wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are marked with traditional red roofs, the 18th-century square with old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to the European middle-east than the traditional Turkey.
One sees the island of Eysturoy from the village of Haldarsvík which also has an unusual octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the cemetery.
It's worth spending half an hour strolling through the exciting village.
North of the city, not too far away, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was made famous by Lord Byron after he gave it a glowing mention.
The Scotturb bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra and has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you must also visit the difficult crypt Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of Marian art that is popular all over the world.
Remember, you are actually visiting a mass grave, in addition to a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this place with the dignity, the celebration and the respect it deserves, and don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Please do not damage the area by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish, and most people have some understanding of the language, but practically everyone speaks Spanish.
Most of the signs are, however, only in Catalan, because it is legally the first official language.
Spanish is also used in public transport and other facilities.
The Metro station's usual announcements are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The reputation of the Parisians is that they are egosentric, cocky and arrogant.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get far in Paris is to still behave best possible, behaving as one who is bien élevé (goodly assigned).
The Paris's fast facade will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by a lot of forest, mainly of beech, granskog and gran trees, and is characterized by a mixture of high mountain and mid-ocean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimate, different soil and varying levels of altitude.
The area also houses a large number of animals and bird species.
There is a rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, gaupe, wildcat and tiur, in addition to several other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer a shawl to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially if it is brightly coloured, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men are required to wear trousers that go over the knees.
This may also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes may not have been washed after each use, so it may be less comfortable to walk in these skirts. One size fits all!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially flesk), and uses olive oil for everything.
A light and well-liked dinner, in any case on summer, is Pa amb Oli: Skive with olive oil, tomatoes and any accessories like cheese, tuna fish etc.
All nouns that are associated with the word you for you always start with a capital letter, even if it's in the middle of a sentence.
This is a meaningful method for distinguishing between any verb and any object.
It also makes reading without doubt easier, even if the writing is a bit difficult, since one then has to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in substantivert form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters that you have to be obsessed with are c and g, since their pronunciation is different based on the following vowel.
In addition, you should be careful since the pronunciation for r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and fairly straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you to learn much about Persian grammar and understand the sentences better.
If you already know a Romanian language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly find that Portuguese is close enough that you don't have to study it separately.
The observatories of the modern era are somewhat obsolete in our time and are often used as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution was not the type of problem in their glory days as it is today, they are usually in cities or at study sites that are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in external areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms shown have been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China, where flowering plum blossoms were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor of Japan only for himself and other members of the aristokratiet around the imperial court.
The plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even just one specimen.
If you visit a formal garden and pick up some samples, you too will be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is usually a very secure place, it's very easy to find, and you can get most of it there once you get there.
But if you are in the high tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to be aware of both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is not so often).
There are also a couple of buses that go north to the city of Hebron, to the traditional burial place where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives are buried.
Make sure that the bus you're going to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba nearby.
The waterways in the interior can be a nice theme to base a trip on.
Visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat ride along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions that we have in the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through the Easter night at an exposed point to see the sunrise.
It may have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but there are of course also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday night in the Easter weekend, with the congresses often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The mammals were unable to make the journey because of the long distance to the continent, and the great land-square-paddy became the first bearing animal on the Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced to Galapagos since the arrival of humans, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less all day.
Since the places are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Dress is the standard job attire, and employees title each other by last name or job title.
Interaction is important in a workplace, with emphasis on group efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval on any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without asking questions.
