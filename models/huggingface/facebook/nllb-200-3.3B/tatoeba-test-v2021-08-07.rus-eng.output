White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black pawn on h4 - match! In chess circles this is jokingly called a dude match.
White: pawn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. white puts the opponent in the zugzwang position, placing the pawn on a6, after which black has only two options: take the pawn on a6 or move the elephant to any other square diagonally b8-h2. in the first case, white moves the pawn from b6 to b7 and mates. in the second case, white takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
