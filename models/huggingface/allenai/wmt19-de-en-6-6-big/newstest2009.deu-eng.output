The Prague Stock Exchange plummets into the black at the close of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague stock exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of normal daily business.
Right at the start of the Tuesday trades, the Prague stock exchange picked up on Monday ’ s slump when it dropped another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the collapse lay on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, this reflects the reaction of the market to the result of the vote by the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the local financial sector.
Case of Shares in Asia
The shares on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset part of the losses over the course of the day.
The index of Hong Kong ’ s Hang Seng Exchange lost nearly four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, bringing the decline down to about 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the local index.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect global financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong monetary authority.
Hong Kong, though part of China, determines its own monetary policy, that is, independently of China ’ s central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt a blueprint to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also be affected by the slump.
A Carnage of American Shares
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, which should be worth up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush ’ s call to support the plan.
In Bush ’ s view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis, thereby helping to stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks went through a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, with a similar decline last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little sign that the bill would not get through the House of Representatives, as the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: U.S. government allowed to pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
US Congressional leaders and President George W. Bush ’ s administration have agreed on a broader agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American lawmakers achieved a breakthrough in talks to adopt a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion (about $12 trillion) in financial assistance to the US financial system.
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen still need to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank told the agency Reuters.
According to various sources, the plan could probably not be voted on in the Senate until Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a notification that the plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
After that, however, there would be "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like, "the Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
On Sunday night, legislators met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government fund.
It provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial firms, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective on the market.
We need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we have reached our goal ", said Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is intended to reassure investors of transactions on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone where a decision by Congress could affect the transactions on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both houses of Congress will vote on the bill, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the last-minute negotiations might not fail due to a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo some changes.
The total amount earmarked for assistance to the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial USD 350 billion is to be made available as quickly as possible, as President George Bush has called for.
But Congress can block the distribution of the rest of the money if it feels that the program is not working, with another $100 billion, and then the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
The president has a veto on this decision, but Congress can overrule his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages, has persisted.
"We have worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "appreciated the mutual efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said that lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary program, protecting taxpayers from losses, finalizing perks, and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law will also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies participating in the programme and establish a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it buys, with the aim of lowering the monthly cost to debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance ’ s chief economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because we do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share the losses between themselves, "Marek told iHNed.cz. This week, he said.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive in Marek ’ s view.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on its adoption is the most important thing at this moment, "stressed Marek.
Cutting edge duel: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
Therefore it looks like it is better to buy only one phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons why you should buy a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and claims of the future owner.
Surely it is hard to buy an expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for them.
But if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music when travelling, that is to say with compressed music, in simple terms - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink ’ s Floyd ’ s fan will hardly be able to take headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The lifetime of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can do much more than just play music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even hint at.
No modern device can be used as universally as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions of telephoning and simming, it can play back music and videos, record both, have a better camera at times and a worse one at times, and perhaps navigate.
And if you include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television photograph.
But the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten hours, for the most part it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For this reason, you should expect the cheap mobile phones to be able to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you still make phone calls from time to time, you would rather buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3-enabled players, you won ’ t have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one recharge.
A further problem exists if one wants to transfer the music to the mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only display the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should inquire about the battery life, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
Is for you music above all scenery and listen to it each day only briefly for example in the tram, then is enough any mobile phone, which plays MP3-files.
What really almost every mobile phone can do.
You also don ’ t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can handle.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will just be in that format.
This is one of the most popular formats, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call up the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be already in and for itself a striking argument for the fact why one should buy a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
But it is generally assumed that it is precisely this type of music sales (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) that will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab your phone in your pocket while the player is lying forgotten at home.
It depends however whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless free speech mechanism with itself.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a few MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music cell phones will be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be the absence of normal headphones.
The best and most sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players lies again in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really be used by anyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar in operation to the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequently horrendous bill for data transfers.
Which device should you reach for?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy an appropriate map, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you ’ re a more demanding handset, you ’ d rather use specialised phones – Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone MP3 control buttons, and the ease of use is similar to that of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series mobile phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the furthest from here.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) will afford you MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fairly mature, and Czech operators offer practically all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Perhaps it will not be long in coming.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, the competition is missing, which really makes a challenge.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and penetration is well over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain about the extremely high level of competition on the Czech market.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), often agrees with this, as he has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has many chances (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies any more).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile operators had to react.
Even before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market, there were similar votes to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
Incidentally, there is no need to look long for examples.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in attracting more than 100 thousand customers and thus becoming the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which owns U: fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can concentrate on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a traditional provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost of building, operating and maintaining a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually present themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
Tesco Mobile, for example, offers SMS in the UK at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a non-clichéd target group can also be quite a good move.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual operators are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of services. "
In Tschechien chancelessly, mean the mobile operators
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"Although we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
It is more likely that Mobilking will enter the market in other countries of our region, "says Jana Studničková, spokesperson of Penta Finance Group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
It indirectly confirmed that the current mobile network operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly favourable to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
For some time now, the GTS Novera group has been demonstrating its interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator, and wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of corporate customers.
"We have a strong interest in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile phone providers.
With some of them we were already able to achieve progress in the negotiations ", said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Perhaps better times are coming now.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual operator may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area, "says Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2's press department in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point out the specifics of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, Spokesperson of the "T" Mobile, adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build."
And she adds: "There will hardly be a virtual provider in the network of the company by the end of the year.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer, in order to be able to think so in the short term. "
Vodafone is more likely to focus its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G ’ s license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual suppliers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider the best from the customer ’ s point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a high-speed mobile Internet. "
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach taken by mobile operators is easy to understand, as another operator would mean more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a reduction in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the suppliers can pull together when it comes to something is also proved by the long back and forth around the emergence of U: fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ was exerted by the company T: Fon when U: fon was launched on the market.
This is also evidenced by publicly available information from ČTÚ websites.
But now U: fon is particularly suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and in particular on its services. "
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the absolute lack of interest shown by Czech regulators is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately - unlike Great Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile operator would then be possible after a contract was concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional suppliers, "said Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his answer to our request.
Such a formulation would not come as a surprise to operators' representatives.
This is more than worrying from an authority that is supposed to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that nobody abuses their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators work normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephony services."
Probably, however, the pressure for the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking about this case is the almost touching harmony between the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely same petrol price at the petrol stations is surely only coincidence and the consequence of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any evidence of anti-competitive action in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market to virtual operators are also likely to be lacking for the telecoms regulator, "said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, then, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators occupies a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And, of course, the mobile network operator has a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment.
Even if one does not follow this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile phone providers proceed strikingly similarly.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is then quite a common trick in telecommunications services, by which ÚOHS dissociates itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to enforce the extension of the competences of the ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications in the recently adopted amendment of the Telecommunications Act, although a number of experts had hoped to improve the situation.
Representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one is looking
The functioning of some pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that spend their own price lists on mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Usually these are companies operating in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will deal with, which may lead to the termination of the cooperation with the company in question," answered Martina Kemrová in answer to our question about this problem.
It is however quite improbable that such a thing does not get around with the responsible persons of the portable radio operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
From the activity of these companies flow to them not negligible profits, at the same time they - in contrast to the actual virtual offerers - are not impaired by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law permits such kinds of speculation, but in spite of this, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot have full access to it like the normal customers of the mobile operators. "
But that alone would at least make ČTÚ seem strange.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to this, why are they turning a blind eye to a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities and, if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration by the providers that they do not know about it and that their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been emphasised several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators has led to a significant fall in the prices of the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the traditional providers have tried to more or less prevent their emergence.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that regulators intervened, trying not to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual operator, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves at each other like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot dispel the impression that lack of clarity in competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But let us not throw in the towel.
If the background information is correct and a virtual operator appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon start to move again.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will no longer make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best out
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Wo ist mein Heimatland at a ceremony on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The arrangers of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already in the past he had told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices, who are distinctive and popular, for the solo-version.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both, and then with the choir, so that the text could be understood well, so that a harmony could be created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theatre in the originally Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular and people accepted it spontaneously.
After the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
Prague public transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will go down in the history of Prague public transport as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket will board a subway, tram or bus.
At the moment, about one hundred thousand people who own the OpenCard chip card can buy it.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it simultaneously stored on their chip card at the information centres and public transport branches at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
As of yesterday, coupons are also available on the Internet at www.dpp.cz.
The service was used up to the afternoon hours by over four hundred customers.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the window in the subway stations, where they used to have to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, and the coupon is transferred to the OpenCard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, travelers will also have a desk with trained staff at their disposal, which will advise interested parties on Internet purchases and also place the coupon on the map," said the spokesman for the project, Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be installed at self-service vending machines on the Opencard, which are installed in some underground train vestibules.
What do such vending machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket values, passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there are to be eighty," Opatrný adds.
A vending machine instead of the driver controls the coupon
The operation of the vending machines, which will operate from tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card and the previously purchased coupon plays by itself.
Starting tomorrow, the electronic coupons will not only apply in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
In the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
“On trains that are part of Prague ’ s integrated transport, train attendants have readers with which they can check the validity of coupons according to time and zone, ” explains Filip Drápal from the Ropid organisation. This organisation compiles the timetables for the Prague transport operators.
The suburban buses have card readers at the cash desk of the driver.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the Opencard must be placed in a marked place on the side of the cash register.
This enables the driver to check the validity of the coupons.
“If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information, ” Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon ’ s validity ends can go to the self-service machines again, where the coupons are placed on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demand a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US president in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was captured by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it says in a letter signed with the words "people who have the fate of the Sudetes at heart."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - to assume that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over for today and forever the protective rule over the Bohemian Forest.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you are attributing this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and has contributed absolutely nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the "Czech oppressors' desire for revenge".
If the US President has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it is sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest region on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or to live under the protective rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today ’ s knowledge of post-war history, it paints a good picture, according to some contemporary witnesses, with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that they would be discussed about their deportation from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from České Budějovice.
During the war he was employed as a German in the navy at the Baltic Sea.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech language would fit them," said Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Benes Decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An Emotional Campaign for Drivers
Most expensive action for safety on the roads in Czech history.
Also in such a way the emotion-loaded medium campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, could be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček expects to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet and also on flyers.
It is intended to dissuade drivers from driving too fast and from driving with alcohol.
And they also remind you to wear your seat belt before starting your journey.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are written in capital letters on a label.
And in a pool of blood there is the word "pay".
This means that you can pay a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal pictures with drastic pictures of accident victims.
This is expected to reduce the number of accidents and road deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick for drivers
"The motto carrot and stick applies to the drivers.
Carrots mean that they save time when they drive red, for example.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk ", said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
That is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, boards warning drivers of a hazard are less effective.
“If you set up a static board to warn of a danger, it will probably soon disappear with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer notice it, ” says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The head of Israel ’ s provisional government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the restitution of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights, if peace could be made with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
He stressed this in an interview published on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all of the [occupied] territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give a similar percentage to the Palestinians (Israeli territory), because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to dispense with part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert, alluding to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple-makers and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That will not work, "he continued.
Subtraction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated Israel ’ s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert stressed.
"The Syrians know all too well what to do without in order to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al Khaida and the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister specified.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance touring bus is not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward would be contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess was killed last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the road for the bus.
Unfortunately, the young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply the moment the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped according to the vehicle registration document also with standing room.
If this is not provided for in the bus, passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing places, which was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the company's director, Radim Jančura.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not agree with the movement of travellers at first.
This was later withdrawn and we reached a consensus that travellers can go to the toilet while travelling if they have their seat, "he said.
The Law Knows No Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes that role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only defines the term vehicle companion, but it does not define its rights and obligations ", adds the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka unequivocally.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law retrospectively covers this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing room in the product registration.
That is all, "he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there is standing room and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing room and higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing room with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like in an airplane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, a road safety expert at BESIP, does not see the movement of stewards on board a bus as a fundamental problem.
"With a liquid way of driving not many dangers threaten, the situation is comparable with the service on board of an airplane.
Here, too, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can poke her head. "
"However, if a bus brakes sharply, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations, "he says, adding that this problem is not completely resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer steward services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this capacity.
The director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to passengers upon boarding.
That would also reduce costs, "he says.
The director of Asiana Alexei Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his bus as an interest in safety. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines in comparison with Student Agency.
"We have no stewardess, we defend ourselves from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident, "he had expressed less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
This was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region who had worked for the company for two years had an accident.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the hard shoulder without flashing and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the truck on the right front.
Jančura denies that the two seats for the stewards were sold.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company intends to sue truck inhabitants.
The agency will not wait for the court ruling to compensate the young woman's family, but it also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-strong team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has already been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving, "says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewardship as something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, adding that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of grand words in WestLB ’ s letter to the company ’ s employees.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer financial institute with the Frankfurt Deka bank “the central capital market house of the savings banks“ financial group ” can develop, say it in on Monday the admits become letter.
WestLB would introduce a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And generally such a connection could be the crucial impetus to further bundling in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
The ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), which recently made clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is pressing to find a solution for the future.
However, for some time now, there has been talk of a connection of any kind - including on the Frankfurt side - between Deka-Bank, which Savings Banks clients know about their investment funds, and WestLB.
In fact, when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, Deka-Bank ’ s boss Franz Waas let it be known that he sees no point in merging the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is supported equally by the Landesbanken and the savings banks' associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to hold talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could concern the capital market business or parts of it.
Nevertheless, the talks have only just begun, as they say at the financial centre.
It is not the first time that there has been talk of the Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked for a moment as if the Deka ’ Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland ’ s Palatinate and Helaba.
But nothing came of this tripartite alliance.
As soon as the plans became public, the Hessian state government declared itself against Helaba ’ s participation.
Also the two other houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rhineland, Palatinate went instead to the Landesbank Baden, Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought-games about a connection of the Deka-Bank with Landesbanken.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about going together with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realisation seems to have matured that it is necessary for the various houses in the public legal sector to move closer together.
After now the state election in Bavaria is over, a connection of the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could come closer as first.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, it will gradually run out of partners.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Savings Banks and Giro Association of Hesse, which holds an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to a merger with West LB.
If anything, it would be Nord LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the German Savings Banks and Giro Association had not yet answered the crucial question of which business model was to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken.
At the end a dismantling of West LB could also stand, which is however naturally not desired there.
So in the letter of the local board of directors, it is said that in any case an "overall solution" is sought for the house.
How to reconcile the merging of individual units with the Deka ’ Bank, remains to be seen.
The second weekend of Wiesn is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer keg of the Kaiser brand, stands a massive bearded tiger and proves to the approximately 200-strong Oktoberfest traveller what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
Four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will depart from here, the coach parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova train station, at 11.45 p.m., expected arrival time: 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, while one bus is reserved for Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing next to their flag already, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur imitation lining and glasses with wide silver temples, belongs to the buses.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours alone this year.
At night, during the day on the Oktoberfest, at 22.30 clock back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Emperor beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it is quiet in the bus, the passengers sleep.
Well, they will still need their strength.
The bus stops in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian number plates stop at the A8 motorway just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives on schedule at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
Firstly, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marcos Reisebüro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's time to run!", Marco calls into the morning.
"Running!" Running and occupying the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not distribute all the yellow caps on the same benches in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8,25 Euro.
And don ’ t forget your tip.
"To the security guards show that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone! "
Third: "This evening point half past eleven come back here!" Understood?
And off you go to the Oktoberfest.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian people ’ s party.
They want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; we are talking about 50 000 who make their way across the Alps and invade the beer tents, 10% of all visitors are said to have travelled from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts statistics on nations in which the Italians take first place ahead of the British (around 60 missions) and Austrians (around 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Believers of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also included that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
This has now happened over the weekend.
The Munich real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is listed in the Dax, receives a multi-billion loan from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses at the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the public finance provider had refinanced itself at extremely short notice for long-term projects for which it had lent money - which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank ’ s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero year-on-year, while income from write-downs on receivables and certain securities and the reversal of provisions in the lending business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of downstream billing costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest pursuant to the German Tax Code and from the business activities of group companies, the loss of earnings of around 16 percent was still moderate.
Following its privatisation in 1990, the former public finance provider had speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been spun off by Aareal Bank.
Because too little was earned in classical public finance, the Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (Private gesund Public Partnership, PPP) and had diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to depreciate the value of the subsidiary, which will have a "significant material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since Depfa ’ s acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on interbank refinancing because it has no client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, bank lending has largely dried up again as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing for a part of the loan portfolio of Depfa - around 50 billion euros - each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financing needs of the group are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is "shielded from the influence of the largely dysfunctional international money markets".
Other sources say that the money ensures refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE ’ s CEO Georg Funke explained that Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to make use of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for by the bank ’ s shareholders and creditors.
But, given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Indeed, it is not unthinkable that the funding need not be used in full.
But even the opposite is not to be wasted.
After on the late Sunday evening according to the interpretation the bank stood still before the insolvency, also the at least provisional rescue cannot calm the minds.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up quite well.
While senior debt is barely moving, the prices of subordinated debt are falling more sharply.
These are mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
In the past, Hypo-Real Estate bonds seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, but now that the banking crisis and the institution itself, which only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa, have intensified considerably, their intrinsic value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as central banks, governments, and commercial banks are willing to back the system, pensions can be expected to be paid off on time.
Or what hardly anyone dares to hope for at the moment will happen - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But, in the face of over-the-top reports of partial nationalization, the probability of near-security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This should give some sleepless nights to long-term believers in particular when deciding whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can at least use a stop line to carry forward future withholding tax payments on exchange gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento ’ s Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself at Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange "Log" she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Already before I went to school I had a itch.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn ’ t get lost.
The beginning of lessons at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The pupils arrive from eight o'clock, until at twenty to nine o'clock a short discussion round with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I am not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 pupils.
Because I didn ’ t have a school uniform yet, I put on my host mother ’ s old skirt, blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
In this act, I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and will be celebrating my birthday in a week's time.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language a good two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all whispered, giggled and waved and all the time I heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '.
Then I quickly jumped into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, she thought it was an honour for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was fairly quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was downright besieged.
They all talked in confusion and giggled and asked holes in my stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break all their bentos unpacked.
My host mother had also made me a lunch box - that's something different from the barren German sandwiches.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and seaweed, fruit and a kind of meat in a tofu coat.
Mostly I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is a fact that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums maybe, brrrr!
The bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made Bento, which she then arranges particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy better during a break snack.
I read about this in my manga, comics.
I am curious whether I can observe this here.
'Why Japan of all places? ', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I have loved reading manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them, I started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to come here sometime.
Because I also have a soft spot for tradition, customs and traditions.
And on this one attaches great importance here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends; on the other, it is strict, disciplined, and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven ’ t felt lost here yet, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I ’ ve ever seen. ”
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could one check whether they feel the same when they behave similarly to us?
The internet journal "Edge" has published contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address issues of sensation or more generally of consciousness, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it places itself dead, flees or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I do not believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and execution / control functions).
This wide region is much more highly developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So, at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature, would probably be very different from most of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its investigation presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what is happening in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick pursued, one focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of the visualization.
So what are the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
In connection with the linguistic nature, subtle gradations of feeling result, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others as well as ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body sensory regions of the cortex and brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in intergenerational sensations.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot disagree with this, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels the same in both cases: how can one verify that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in case of danger if she feels fear too?
In my view, mere behavioural similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if one could prove this for humans, how did one want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level beckons here, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You may think that is short-sighted, but I would rather make progress than run against a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
President Platini: Term of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyuk said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries. "
The two hosts are lagging behind in the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed, "said Ukrainian Association President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa" President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the Euro 2012 will not suffer. "
Several first-division players had been sentenced to forced relegation in the last season alone because of manipulation, finally even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private things - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan revealed her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams - and strikes back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant argument with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan commented for the first time on the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She learned the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's outrageous," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg once again chews up and rewrites the history of our relationship."
It is also "regrettable" that their 16-year-old son, Jack, is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
And so he concludes his remarks with a swipe: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky that I have a wonderful family that is doing very well. "
Air tickets and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analyzed its accounting data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, noted a significant decline in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the nights have already become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed saw prices increase by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this as the weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a "waning wanderlust of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London were also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in air fares also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in fuel costs, travellers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, Economy Class fares fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but prices in Business and First Class were much lower.
Prices in Germany fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices on German domestic flights have even halved.
The reason for the price slump is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone this was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1: 0
With one goal and simple methods the Hamburger SV will be the leader of the standings.
With Borussia Luhukay still fails to find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein enlarge crash landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Moenchengladbach player came into the game late and failed with a lift to the bar.
His message was precisely formulated, it passed his lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher reputation than many past players.
And so his request was heeded in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb approvingly.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Give it to Tor zwei!
Implementation failed to materialise.
"Not everything was nice to look at today", admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have liked it to be "more relaxed".
The Hamburg team owe the 1-0 (1-0) to the head ball goal of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburg team.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class leader.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify it," said Marcell Jansen.
He senses that the tabular interim certificate stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-signed entries - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen, who has been forced away by FC Bayern - finds itself slowly, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," demanded Jol.
After the defeat
On Wall Street, there is fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily slump by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in its history.
Later the Dow caught something again.
At 20: 30 hrs, the world ’ s most important stock market barometer was down a good five percent at 10,579 points.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down by more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
The biggest losers at that time were the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent, and the Bank of America, which lost around 12 percent.
No title could win.
Shares in Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett acquired a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds will be made available for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage securities.
However, the sum is not to be paid out in one fell swoop, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock options from the finance companies, which could be redeemed at the appropriate price to reduce the burden on the treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and USA down
The billions in aid given to banks in Europe and the US do not remove the doubts of investors.
The share price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and pulls down the Dax.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The stock of the Munich-based real estate financier temporarily lost three-quarters of its value despite the rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell well below the psychologically important 6,000 points and was listed with a decline of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world have plummeted.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government ’ s $700 billion rescue package might not be enough to restart financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan; the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially dropped by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the leading Japanese index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points following initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the slope in the Seng ’ s index slid by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.

Privatbank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed for the 23 million new shares.
The retail and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity in research: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called Swing ’ by ’ manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein ’ s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
She is now threatened with cold death because of soon freezing fuel lines.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing by the anomaly.
The Swing ’ by is a manoeuvre performed by space probes that gives them additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
This physical trick was used by the European research probe “Cassini ” Huygens as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
However, what has astonished the researchers for years is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the time-honored law of gravitation.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him "Swing" by "Anomaly".
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein ’ s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing of anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space researchers for around ten years.
From it obviously an attracting force proceeds, whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit and reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
Six hostage-takers were allegedly killed in a shooting before their release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Ransom negotiations are already running.
Again and again Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al ’ Arabija and Italian media alike.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are just checking their state of health, "Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions are safe and sound, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear. According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, "the official said.
It was "only a matter of receiving the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather led to the death of a woman, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after having confessed to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had shackled and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts while her mother was away working in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The court learned, however, that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted for abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I used to tie her up and bind her eyes."
"I have not sexually coerced her.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still, it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not. "
He added: "I take note of the effect that, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, her deed has had on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman. "
Officials responsible for lost data will be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost highly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "They thought it would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged pursuant to paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Procuratorate recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of Al Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret place.
Housing companies look B & B costs in the eye
British housing companies could face costs of more than £80 million following the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley ’ s 2.6 million deposits.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it is "intolerable" that the companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to raise GBP 81 million for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Housing Association, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved prudently during the property boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records were made in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing associations and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
2010 will see interest due for a full year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bilateral organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by a further five pence per litre from Monday onwards.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations carried out by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they wish to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale market price of Jersey milk changed most recently in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to bail her on charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina ’ s long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government grant her unrestricted freedom for the time being.
The correspondents say that although her release was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear when she is released whether she will be able to remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers claim that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail because it says that she does not have to be given a bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique, ul Huq said.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court. "
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami ’ s alliance leader said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army took power in a supported interim government, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Anti-polio fears in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan left almost 200,000 children unvaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations implemented a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
This was the case, according to a UN spokesman, despite the Taliban ’ s promise not to attack or impede the thousands of vaccine-carrying staff.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its case against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share distorts competition and gives it an unfair influence over ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the competition authority reported that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the competition commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom communications department have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US public prosecutor ’ s case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to investigate the dismissal of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine US prosecutors from office in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors were being dismissed because of poor performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to regard the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in prosecuting senior Republican members of Congress, while others refused to investigate allegations of Democratic fraud.
US prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales, then head of the Ministry of Justice, came under fire for the redundancies and eventually resigned.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report specifically criticised the role of Gonzales, saying that he had assumed "primary responsibility" for the redundancies, had "abandoned" his leadership role and had shown "extraordinary disinterest" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell" during the Q Award ceremony.
The singer, who will receive his special golden award next week in London during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 Hitalalbum.
"Coldplay" leads the shortlist for this year's awards, having been shortlisted in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go beyond such material as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice provided by Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached # 15 in the UK charts.
But Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obskure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major thoroughfares, avenues, side streets, and other bypasses, some famous and others convenient.
However, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it is hard to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that has recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block.
But the Municipal Department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and for the street, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the municipal council this month, representatives of the municipality and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee favors the street remaining in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district councilor in the Council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to remain the property of the city," she said.
"There could be offers to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it would be repaving the small street and installing seats, which would include a café to which the company would like to rent out space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said that it was indeed the city ’ s wish to sell the road, and stressed that the department ’ s job was to develop rather than manage the property.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historic impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), has published a part of the conversation in the city's history about Extra Place, which appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac, which remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and week-old newspapers flying past gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked exactly the same recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished up a bit.
Fields added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the allure of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Associate in Caliphate Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why Middle Class Needs School Selection."
Addressing the Hispanic electorate is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama ’ s proposals on education are a case in point.
Obama ’ s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students ” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama ’ s curriculum recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition in education for those who are learning English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take the example of Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state examination in Math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practises the approach according to which the training takes place in an English-speaking environment, which is precisely the point that Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized classes.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a pupil who had just come from Mexico. Twelve months later, one would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama use a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with large numbers of Latin American and other English students?
The school ’ s achievements would make the answer easy, but educational positions within his own party (national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama ’ s response uncertain.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aimed at 'English only'.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close the gap, he should carefully consider education models that work, rather than disdain and trivialize them.
The price of oil is falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the American bailout plan might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures at the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been rocked by both Wall Street financial turmoil and powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 per barrel this month, only to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors once again expressed concern, even though congressmen had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan at the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the strained negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation deteriorates further, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to fall further.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From a commodity market perspective, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading globally, particularly to China."
The Bank ’ s analysts have revised downward their oil consumption expectations due to weak economic growth in the coming year, lowering their oil and gas price projections by 20% for 2009.
Team record established by series in the second quarter
Defenseman Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen it all, after he showed up more than anyone else in the jersey during the last eight and a half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, where the Jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumphal procession.
"I've never seen anything like that before," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
But when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernue ’ s Cole ’ s for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration made a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, one slipping as an outer defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't make much effort," Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
“He ’ s a super player.
Our vote was right, no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Cole were playing catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
Outside defender Darrelle Revis intercepted an unlucky throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss from Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into a 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, because the Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points to score without a single, said Mangini: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time. "
Rested Gebrselassie sets his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in Sunday ’ s Berlin Marathon and becoming the first person to complete the 42.2 kilometre course in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2: 04: 26 by 27 seconds, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his versatile career, achieving at least one world title or world record on every course from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon for fear, perhaps exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution might worsen his asthma problems.
Instead he has registered for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sunshine and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Ever since Kenya ’ s Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat switched to endurance, the marathon ’ s record time has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with a result of 2: 06: 05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Obviously he came back refreshed and not rusty after a break.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed practice a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end it was all great. "
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, relying too much on race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records above the competition.
But this criticism does little harm to Gebrselassie ’ s greatness as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the center of the course in 1: 02: 04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pace setters had slackened.
A little more than three miles before the finish Gebrselassie made his last attempt to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2: 05: 36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2: 07: 48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2: 19: 19.
The world record of 2: 15: 25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon with 2: 24: 14.
She missed the Games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has cleverly planned her run by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners break away, but overtaking them after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came in third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and strains in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Tucked away among the sprawling amusement parks in the Orlando area, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic bustle, lies a tranquil city where the pride and complications of the Afro-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the town with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city it describes - and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida guidebook produced at the time of the Depression by the Federal Writers Project - is, in many ways, a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he escapes."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation on race, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very careful how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a parish member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be true. "
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the black culture - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and wary.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville ’ s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Off the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds, which are always taken care of by Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the widow Dash ’ s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells all kinds of beverages and whatever suits the room at the time. ”
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," according to 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson ’ s girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty, full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came into town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers, in a city that, even today, imagines its venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Mr Franklin said.
But "it never stayed too long," he added while rocking in his chair, on a backward terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960 she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous writer, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings on a grand scale.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay out a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the town ’ s slow two-lane main street.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle against racial mingling brought hatred to the community.
"At that time, often a bunch of white boys came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting aside," Mr. Franklin said.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car. "
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court ’ s demand for integration by calling its decision in Brown ’ s case against the School Council “insulting rather than respecting my race. ”
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place, she added.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to make room for more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who disregarded prejudice, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on bookshelves, making it part of the American literary canon once again.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville ’ s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston ’ s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy by building the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district abandoned its road-building plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway enlivened the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, and awakened real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a bit simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
More and more people arrived, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past anew.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often treated with caution.
For most interviews a permit is necessary in advance and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represents black men with the field work - may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that their secluded community is being misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as Hurston ’ s festival grew, an increased degree of local pride was born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire breed: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and hard-working, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Franklin ’ s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work for the city administration or police who, according to him, might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only drive through here will think," Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others, "Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York people speak fluently financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn ’ t even realize that they were in the midst of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers, and hedge fund administrators that have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst day of horror since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea trolleys along sidewalks with loud rattles and transport trays loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still shuffling between apartments, like human pack animals laden with about 50 ironed t-shirts hanging from a similar pole on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting on their breakfast bars on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4pm and 7pm.
It didn ’ t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, after all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my obligation course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people queuing.
Not at the cash desk to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal banker with a license", were queuing up for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (somewhat resembling a building society), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that have branches only in one state, and say that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went bankrupt quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion worth of assets, went bankrupt, and last Friday, when New Yorkers went home for the weekend, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion worth of savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and retail workers who stood in front of me took their cash to a bank considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most Wall Street rescue purchases.
Ordinary New Yorkers have acquired fluent financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who telephoned my regular Chinese supermarket referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld with so much familiarity, as if she were blaspheming a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment building, has strayed from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated during right slide in Austria
On Thursday 17 January 2008, Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the right-wing Belgian Pertei Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamisation".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of desecration of graves in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, where extreme right-wing parties made considerable profits in the country ’ s parliamentary elections on the same weekend.
In the night from Friday to this morning more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were seriously damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but detectives consider this an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the funeral desecration that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan draws to a close.
At the same time, Austria is facing a round of soul-searching after sliding to the right in yesterday ’ s parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
The FPÖ (Freedom Party), which won 18% of the vote, won a campaign to ban headscarves and burkas, and even revealed its aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme right is the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam ’ s rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been legally banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges suspended Glitter for six months after he informed the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after they presented evidence to judges of Glitter ’ s criminal record of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
The Court's spokesman reported: "On Thursday 25 September, the Kent police at the Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person. "
As required by the register of sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent Police Unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimise any risk to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after a while.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for permission to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possessing pictures of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Secretary of the Interior Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I welcome the master behind the stage to capture his character ', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers, who give up concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artists
On the other hand personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture that is typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco' people ', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this point of view, he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'flamenco' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that they are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don ’ t have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character is in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera '.
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', went on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the available material, images were created that are reminiscent of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands flamenco: 'music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing per se, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and has been the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as' Portraits of the Veterans of Sport '(' SportARTproject ').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco' people 'are different, the photographer admits that' I like very much to photograph people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, people you sometimes don ’ t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas. '
The collection of portraits of today ’ s flamenco, entitled ‘ Flamenco ’ People ’, is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is' foolhardy '.
He doesn ’ t know yet where the plot of the novel takes place and what it ’ s all about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he ’ s currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the favourite Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is working on is' a foolhardy one 'and that' everything indicates that he does not have to write the novel '.
'If I were prudent, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it and hope to end the novel someday ', so he finished his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and to whom most of the attendees gave their votes, is compared with the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noticed that he had an audience in front of him, which noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humour, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was born, which arose out of an 'extraordinary thirst for adventure', out of 'pleasure in reading' and out of 'more than before'; how he writes and 'maintains discipline' to 'fill in the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentaries, numerous corrections and revisions that he does; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which 'images of memory' are the basis of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is' no way 'by which one can measure and how one can know whether books change life,' but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience, 'stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it' produces effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers' not to abandon themselves to lightness' and 'take responsibility' for 'his vocation'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play along: bullfighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the bullfighters announced that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was postponed to yesterday morning.
So the organizer, with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández's consent, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the feast was exposed to unstable weather, which meant that two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it was raining, so the second scheduled bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had succeeded in doing more by cantering than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded with boo calls in his second fight.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes to ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen asked the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the 28 year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when traffic police officers from the Álava region had already completed traffic checks on the N 1 and were passing through the city of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to do the route control, but the driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the road after a few kilometers. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car in order to flee over a country road into a forest area.
The Ertzaintza City police finally caught up with one of them. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2.178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with bunches of hashish, which were later taken to other police stations for precise laboratory analysis and weighing of the bunches.
Furthermore, officials found that the registration plate was' double ', so it did not correspond to the number plate stated in the vehicle documents, which led to an additional arrest for falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation in order to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, has managed to escape, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
Arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be brought before the custodial judge for the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for her role as Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness has observed how she tried to leave her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, reported spokesman of the traffic police of California to the magazine 'People'.
The witness detailed that Locklear 'pushed the gas pedal after 4: 30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car out of the parking space to the rear or the front, and as she drove backwards she grabbed her sunglasses several times'.
A little later the witness, who had probably not known the actress at the beginning, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the Emergency Service because she 'was afraid to live Locklears'.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed to be disoriented ', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to do a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'According to the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' said the speaker.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance, which could not be determined, and taken to a local detention centre at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona clinic after receiving treatment for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian federation of the United Left should be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and member of the United Left, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sport of the Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organisation will be the one that will have to take responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out how the party must deal with the person who has been a member of the Seville municipal council until now.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations that Silva might have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases get the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has' a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
'Sangre de mayo ': Hero Book of Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, in 'Sangre de mayo' José Luis Carci presents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with an investment of about 15 million euros for the shooting.
In this way, the cineaste tried to 'portray a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he had always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
'Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the Telemadrid channel as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures us that his' childhood dream 'came true thanks to this filming, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre who, three years ago, commissioned him from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second centenary on 2 November in Madrid. Especially because the story is based on' Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming offers Garci, as he added, the 'unique opportunity' to portray, with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the false leader for the fight, because the people had been put behind by the fight for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand the VII'.
However, the cineast regrets that it was not possible to count on the funding like in 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in 'Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', participated through his usual way of working: he stood on the stage next to the actors with whom one has to rehearse before shooting and for those who had not done a casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and respectful, 'part of the profession of film director consists in providing help in the theatre and in the cinema, in order to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many of the actors he meets in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar-winning candidate in four nominations (one of which he won), believes and asserts that none of the three candidates who this year represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish cinematography, neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés', nor, finally, the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
For this film Garci does not expect any awards.
'In the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's just for prosperity, and now you're happy if you've produced another film, 'explains Garci after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed me this role, which seemed impossible to me. '
'We try not to talk about her life, but to preserve her spirit, 'said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance basics helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly 'for example seemed to me like Guajira, or' the dance of the serpent 'like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area, 'she says.
The production counts on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco in Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her former students.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work and I feel very honoured. '
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'assumes the role of companion of the artists who were Divas, with whom he always falls in love.'
This work also tells a certain story of the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works are no longer appreciated by anyone today, and therefore even less appreciated ', claims Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20: 30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006 and 2008), the aim being to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
Thus, 'the triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will conclude with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that will take place in New York, with the restoration of the home museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez in Zenobia and with the traveling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez:' Aquel chopo de luz ', which was opened in May and, after having been in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and will be presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez, Enciso, with the aim of promoting the person and work of the Andalusian poet.
The USA can hardly imagine without Paul Newman
'Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them. '
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in 'Sensational Reporter', and from the then dominant notion of U.S. American cinema, which was abandoned, from all of America to Newman came with his enthusiastic imagination and followed her.
Look what it cost her to award him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow to everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend, 'Robert Redford said weeping,' my life and my country were the greatest perfidies of his life. '
No one was afraid neither to ridicule nor to exaggerate.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died at a sad moment when there was fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, when the depressed self-esteem of the U.S. Americans was searching hopelessly for reasons to restore dignity.
If in this difficult time without virtue few people remain who can be admired, one does not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and, like various losses, he also suffered profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs, founded in honour of his son from his first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift to the country, in which it took a great deal of effort to prevail against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of astonishment beats outrageous over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'The greatest of us all has left us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintain high standards of integrity, lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even impossible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many opportunities not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home? 'he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as those of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist, 'they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are poor.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure in 2012, maybe in 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my judgement it was the worst road with all the trimmings that existed.
Of course, that is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, such a thing would clearly not come through.
But let us go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the tickethole, which allows you to go first.
It doesn ’ t seem bad to me either, but if they let you go ahead, they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
Surely not.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense, which consists of only going there because of that) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The t-shirt was only available in the size 'S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it the case that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So, stuff like this is a trifle compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack there.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road began and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had been possible once, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
Furthermore, in those 40 minutes of waiting for rain, there was a temptation to organise a popular uprising and attack the house.
I believe that tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of the chip that I have received, I can imagine that the outcome has been stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect street, this street would never come to my mind.
So I think we will dream for a long time of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the advancement of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a creature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a route planner to move around the company ’ s campus), paying attention to what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is talking to her, and is not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, people talked very superficially about Microsoft ’ s change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer stated that if the computers were equipped with the essentials, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would function five times faster. Hey, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a statement, considering that in Windows versions Microsoft added one or another function and 'extras'.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Many skillfully pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to informing his mother-in-law.
That is true.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its' death ', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the Web ’ s browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the environment of the 'windows'.
What does half of computer applications do?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft ’ s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become an alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt. I bring you a small example.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the soft drink vending machine is a sign: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for research on the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 is in delay.
It will not be published at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for a way to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to market simultaneously.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already in the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the innumerable stars, we can fall back on the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted up heavy weights in a traveling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male cotton shirt, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speakers call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
Firstly, because of its great name, even though it is called 'Marcel' in a narrow circle. Legend has it that the origin of the name is connected with sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel 'towers over everyone because of its superb cotton, its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which has these T-shirts as a detail of the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company does not only concentrate on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, tee shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They are very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I am not worried about the candidate '
Her big appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full of joie de vivre.
Currently, the Gruz siblings take their new activities in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls, who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn / winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intensive work time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango?
My sister and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50 and 60 years; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, aren ’ t you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together in one and these areas have many things in common.
Ever since I was little, I have been fascinated by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's to rummage through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to look after the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is linked together, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh what.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was little and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, are you thinking of becoming a mother, or not?
For a long time I have known that I am becoming a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and educate him with much love.
As far as cinematography is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and which were shot last year.
That is exactly how it is, and I would very much like them to be presented to the public.
As a woman who comes from the theatre, I am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago you appeared on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's good, don't say anything like that.
It is not that I went on the walkway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity event of her organisation 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we are showing. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection were auctioned off for mango to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People do not know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they are not true.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is necessary.
Drivers who may relapse because of the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who has had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installs in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is drunken, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to them, it is a pilot project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver, so he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
Experience has shown that in addition to the General Prosecutor ’ s Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Technical Institute of Automobile Safety Foundation will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists who have been reported more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol, sat at the wheel again.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has done an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000 and the costs are borne by the person imposing the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevented up to 65% of regulatory violations in the first year after their introduction.
Spain is expected to save 115 lives annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: tackling this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be realized in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is demanded, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still not available in the Spanish markets, in no shop, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow of all days, the Chamber of Deputies will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers ’ Party, which is proposing to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep'
With British punctuality, at 17: 40, at the time envisaged by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Right on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so there you can take at the airport at this time of the peopleSie ist von hieroder so
No, she is Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, which deliver honour volley.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep fertig toes', perhaps was told that a thunderstorm was expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in which the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no better place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion, and there was probably no much more outstanding fashion designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton' Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the window of the Mango store on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
Incidentally, this is the second largest store of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m ².
The largest shop is located in London.
So many events have taken place that we would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for chairing the competition jury, which ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, pulled herself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and some jewelry from ELAH, which were breathtaking. He held on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a gentleman that he ended up together with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the shop and wore a pair of trousers and a shirt, which she modelled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black, sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning, we were delighted by the presence of Oliver Martínez, a character who always provokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There are not 1000, but one more possibility to forget chaotic and rapid everyday life.
And even if there are only a few of them, all of them are collected in a book that tells you how to relax, which will be available in bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 in the morning, but even worse seems the idea to get back into the hectic rhythm that the current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that lead to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of shutting down the world of work.
But the number is increasing, no more and no less than to 1001.
In addition to yoga, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The book against stress is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and so the tranquility that the book conveys comes to the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts is disproved by this manual of such faith.
In addition, the methods of staying in contact with nature are proposed or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance to the body and stress has become a problem, the time has come to sit down on the sofa, switch off the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children speak at night
I am not talking about those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but about the children who speak while they are asleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, during a high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is no reason for this phenomenon.
Often connections are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have mentioned before, it can be due to very high fibers, stressful situations or excessive demands.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks calmly in single words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (screams, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem that causes anxiety and in this way comes about.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, either, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep, apnea or with the stress).
What you can do is to perform a series of simple preventive actions:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a bit too wild.
For the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them to get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When speech occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear him out of sleep.
Although the child is speaking, he is sleeping, so he is resting.
Think about it, if it appears to be frightened after a couple, then it is recommended to seek advice or find out what reason the child has for the fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), they don't put pressure on the child to make an interrogation and get more information.
So you won't be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and can't think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don ’ t worry, it ’ s not bad, it ’ s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhäusern... finally
After a long dry spell, Illhäusern is finally back on the road to success.
With little effort, the yellow-and-black team gained numerous scoring chances and managed to realize one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had difficulty showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot passed close to the angle, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a long-range shot, then Hirn with a high-pass, and Romain with a shot with the toe tip, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi pass at the head of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two chances to score, won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which was exactly right to accept a ball that had been repulsed by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the illhäusische goal scorer should not be able to enjoy its luck for a long time and about twelve minutes later on the bank be sent, whereby its teammates numerically inferior had to play further.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not confront an Illhaeusian eleven with any major problems, which only withdrew a little to 'consolidate' their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the bar after a great mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
Given the firm stance taken by the fishermen who blocked access to several ports in Brittany and Normandy on Monday, the French President decided to arrive in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come up with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the fishermen of Brittany to impose measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record level of over EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée Palace, David Martinon, 'the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and secure the conditions of employment and pay of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing jams nearly ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle ’ île were not cut off.
The peninsula Quiberon was delimited with a barrier.
Already on Monday, seafarers demonstrated their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or in Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not sail, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire, Atlantique, dissolved the blockade of the important refinery in Donges.
The French from Boulogne, sur Mer, decided to await the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue ', because' the fishermen will not give in on any point 'and' do not want to go to Paris', announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently costs the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can be reached only with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 as a result of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinema legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its 2008 supply forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, is delivering 215 aircraft in 2008, according to its President, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
The aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft in the first half of the year.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which has received financial support from the US monetary authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that it has been granted.
AIG is ready to head for the sale of much of its business, beyond its international life insurance and retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met Sunday evening to review potential sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Among the assets that AIG would potentially dispose of are its aircraft leasing operations, its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments, the FT explains.
No final decision was taken on these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as quickly as possible in order to repay the loans of EUR 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall in prices on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson ’ s plan to bail out banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final numbers, the Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73, mainly in technology, and the widely used Standard & Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the Chamber of Deputies unexpectedly rejected the plan to bail out the banks, which was supposed to restore some stability to the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been battered at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the MEPs refused the finance secretary Henry Paulson the means he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
‘ A bad picture is being circulated that shows Congress as incapable of accepting a plan, ’ said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan ', she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come' too late '.
'If the project is indeed doomed (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the US Federal Reserve, ed.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further restrict credit conditions, 'warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza, emphasizing the sense of extreme urgency, stressed that 'every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial company' in the United States'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia's banking operations by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures for banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the markets are facing 'not just an American crisis but a global one', the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the Treasury within ten years has decreased Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and the revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first television duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who won, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the Republican and Democrat election QGs announced their own victory in this television duel, which was to be watched by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, while respectable, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his electoral decline five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup ’ s institute, which released an opinion poll on Saturday claiming that Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly doing better.
Among the undecided voters, those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls, with 39%, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has' good instincts', but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain never ceased to highlight his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, clearly underlining the 'naivety' of his opponent with regard to these issues, which were at the heart of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... 'he stressed several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become President, 'he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican advertising spots since yesterday.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He was brief and precise, without letting himself be upset.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, but Obama has', countered this weekend in a Democratic election advertisement, in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis weighing on 'Americans off the streets'.
‘ During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, ’ Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered in pouring rain at an election rally in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words' middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives a clear advantage to Obama, whom the Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss.
'Next week could be a decisive turning point ', estimated the influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's' good economic instincts' to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is' the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain '.
After reiterating that he might even succeed in cutting taxes on 95% of Americans, despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, Illinois ’ s senator pointed out that creating the country ’ s potential energy independence and promoting renewable energy, along with introducing a health-insurance system, was his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant consisting of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously sidestepped questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) plan to save the financial market, which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk? '
Young people and members of the opposition demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the market square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they did not vote in the first place: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my vote anyway', says one young person.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including not granting visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and freezing up certain assets, could be lifted if the observers deemed these elections to be clean.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count ', regretted Yuri Potemkin, spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and for us it is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television airtime, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition therefore owes it to itself to interfere in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a Russian protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent '.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that voter turnout seems too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of the Minsk electorate) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Did you notice that an election took place? 'asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in the parliament, and those who are closest to the ideas of the government. '
The silence of the night descends again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - Of blood that became safe again
Yesterday, Hema ’ Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema ’ Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained the public ’ s trust, which was severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s.
As is known, the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donation Service ’ s national blood reserves were contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, with the aim of shedding light on the circumstances which had led to such a tragedy and of drawing up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
Whereas Judge Krever hesitated to give his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system of blood administration in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks have been set up in Canada: the Quebec Blood Company, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company, which is responsible for the other provinces and the two territories.
'In 1998, when Hema, Quebec, began its work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood and through the work in this area over the following years, we have regained the trust of the public, 'she says, before proudly stressing that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema, or Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary remains aware that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Hema ’ s Quebec City has acted according to the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt, "Jakob" disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
'And we had not the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
We therefore referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are used when we do not know this and when a disease progresses slowly, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt, and Jakob, which manifests itself in a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proved beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the precautionary principle that we have applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NST) tests, which allow detecting the presence of the virus directly in the donor ’ s blood, rather than the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period, which takes place between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was substantially reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in every 12 million people is at risk of obtaining blood infected with HIV.
'In other words, it means that one would have to distribute 12 million canned blood before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema ’ Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 canned blood every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted through a blood bank could occur.
I believe that nowadays one can feel comfortable with receiving a blood transfusion or prescribing it in order to restore health ', says the director of the Hema Quebec.
'The challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya ’ virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil ’ virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We must monitor continuously, 'continues Dr Décary, before she emphasises that Hema ’ Quebec must also provide adequate care in addition to safe care.
'Demand is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population is also having an impact on the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebec residents eligible for blood donation. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they have AIDS or malaria, and anyone who has travelled to a country where malaria is endemic is excluded from donating blood for one year.
'With this 3% we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they grow older and unable to donate more blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep it and get it to become a regular donor.
Life today is so hectic that it is rare to find the time to spend an hour donating blood, 'regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema behandlung Quebec not only supplies blood, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema, Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which used to be regarded as biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand per year.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year," continues Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood loss program as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to it ', because Hema ’ Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact im Halbfinale »
Montreal ’ s Impact qualified for the semi-final of the USL First Division elimination games yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 with all goals) over Seattle ’ s Sounders in the second and final game of the quarter-final series at Saputo ’ s stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the deciding goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half without goal for both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for Montreal ’ s lineup.
Roger Levesque was the only one standing in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let ’ s remember that in the first game of the series of forwards and replays on Friday Impact brought a 2 to 1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-final Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night, Thunder made up for a 3-1 deficit with a 4-3 win in the return leg in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semi-final with a 5-4 goal ratio.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - victory gate by Kovalev
The number one ranked trio of the Canadian team is ready to tackle the season.
Last night, the unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev turned a pass in this winning game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preliminaries.
Kovalev scored the victory by scoring the only goal of the whole shootout.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel good. '
'He was too focused on it in the first half, remarked Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received tumultuous applause. '
Charest bets on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (Left) is trying to be elected in today's part-election.
'Moving the course of our last great border in the North ': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levi, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
Spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc. were shown on three huge screens.
Great resources as during the parliamentary term.
Incidentally, the Prime Minister refused to rule out holding elections this autumn, even though he said that his schedule was very busy.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the Prime Minister is said to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was' a jewel with enormous potential ', but did not give a date, investment figures or precise priorities for future projects.
At most, some perspectives on what more could be done: first of all on hydropower, on forests, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to the enumeration by Mr. Charest, the North has nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This' area twice the size of France '' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is within us', he stressed, as if to show clearly that he is trying to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the North, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
‘ It ’ s ours, it ’ s our future, ’ he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude followed by all governments.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and if the opportunity arises I will resume this position on behalf of the government, 'he said.
Furthermore, 'with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the North', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be passable all year round due to the melting of the ice.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec Government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist deputy of Ungava) have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) plays an important role, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the Plan North will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
'Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to transform the challenges into new growth and development hubs.
Incidentally, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage ’ s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power station to the Adélard, the Godbout, the dam.
‘ From Godbout, who created Hydro ’ Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James ’ Bay, our party has always known how to determine the future, ’ Jean Charest explained.
To the press he referred to another, this time conservative, project, the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
'That remains with us, but I intend to be there, 'he confided to his party members, which provoked those storms of applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly no elections in 2009, has not in fact ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which he can do by law.
It stresses, however, that its agenda is full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly at the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, primarily 'constitutional goals', which were accepted without further ado: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the 'special nature of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto over Quebec decisions.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of Plan Nord were received with scepticism.
The head of the Québécois Parti, Pauline Marois, has revived the policy of development of the North of Quebec that the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it refrained from applying it.
If she had done so, 'we would have gone much further today', said Mrs Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Claude Talon (where the election is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
‘ But what we want is for this not just to be a big show, ’ explained party leader Sébastien Proulx on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is back on holiday today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Mr Vic Toews, ex-Justice Minister (what an irony) in the Harper cabinet, took the liberty of saying last summer about Louise Arbour that she was a 'disgrace' to Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering it with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing with a government which is the only one from all the countries concerned not to bring home its compatriot, who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that he is accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, is breaking its word and allowing a child soldier to vegetate in inhumane conditions.
The only one to descend into a parody of justice in order to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association in particular are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that also turns a blind eye to torture: it is of little interest to them that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will surely be forever mentally broken.
We are not yet aware of this, but what we are witnessing here is an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', a word that Harper is constantly carrying in front of him like a flag and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily mistreated, tortured and imprisoned, at the discretion of a head of government who is still supported by the minority (may he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they can find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its 17 September issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice Director General of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
It confirms, following an Orwellian logic, that the largest gold mining company in the world sought a libel suit of over six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening up a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of defamation, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to engage in a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to hold one of her opposing views.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editors of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal battles, moreover, is often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the opposing side and also deters anyone who dares to return to the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things to public opinion.
Contrary to what is common in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas and not through blows of sticks.
It would therefore have been enough if the gold mine had opened up its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a wave of his hand.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how, at the same time, he can ask for a 'public' debate while ignoring the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice-President, this word covers only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, is doing so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag, a complaint (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada asking them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth discovery that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the world's rich companies do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could conduct it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold ’ s disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university world, as well as to public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit this type of unwarranted complaint.
Wall Street bailout – Democrats and Republicans get along well
The Bush administration and senior Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to end the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
The main points are: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public funds, new orders to reduce the number of houses seized due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the companies supported.
The US Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective," said the Bush administration's representative, Henry Paulson.
'Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street crisis, 'declared the Democrat.
'The fundamental point is that if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest in Americans' daily lives will be enormous, 'declared Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the effect that another failure would have had on investor sentiment.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates who took part in the negotiations late were more likely to support the agreement, but without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to hit them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those that would allow owners to keep their homes, and those that would affect the salaries of the executives of companies saved by the state.
'Asking taxpayers to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of certain people is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary ', he explained on the American television channels.
When asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guiding principles that I have read [show] that this is a thing that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is quite simply unacceptable, 'he said.
The 700 billion dollars ’ plan is aimed at using taxpayers ’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime), before expanding to other forms of more widespread debt (PCAA), and then to a freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who last week failed the first attempt at agreement.
Ever since democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of distressed societies should only be secured by the government and not bought, people have believed that they are escaping the impasse.
To round off the perspective for all in Congress, an injunction has also been added stating that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which a further 100 billion can be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington will receive shares in the subsidized companies, which will earn dividends in case of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will be able to stop the seizure proceedings relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan, and will also be able to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
Indeed, more voices were raised yesterday against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
‘ Obviously Washington does not understand us, ’ Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Finance Commission, told his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of making taxpayers pay '.
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called 'the caucus of the sceptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us that we ask Congress not to be pressured and to consider carefully which way to go, 'he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have again had proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risky property loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," declared Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
As compensation, we receive voting rights and influence in the Bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are looming. '
During that time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of home loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to nationalise the British Government since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump card, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent probably also kept him away from a position of power that gave birth to the really terrible monsters.
But what a great continuous run!
Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch on Friday at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the blowing up of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jew and Hungarian mother.
Its European roots were to become one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality feature.
For it reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, with the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This very man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Man, and also a sex symbol, although he had lived with actress Joanne Woodward in a model relationship since 1958.
Along with him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and hypersensitive star, whose mystery you will never completely solve, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman plunged cinema lovers into a frenzy this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of the memoirs.
More than half a century of American cinematic art in constant change passes him by.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958, are remembered again.
A much more recent memory (1990) is evoked, that of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer, Rocky Graziano, from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, who was taken up again after his death and whom Newman really made famous in 1956.
This likeable crook in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
As bitter and vengeful billard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still he.
Epochs unite in his curriculum vitae.
The youth especially knows him from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role in 2003 as godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes the circle came full circle.
In contrast to several cinema legends who withdrew early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, its fortune, its pomp and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to 'underplaying', when he judged his excessively expressive achievements.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, evildoers or desperate people, whose perfect portrayal reflected his sliding and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of honours that bestowed upon Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade in arms, Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), was deeply moved: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and zest for life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift, is now also going down the drain.
We have probably often seen him stand with his foot in bowls of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this considered quite tasteless, although we initially found it funny.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the point of firing.
He left his five daughters a letter with these words: 'Always and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honour to be here. '
And it was an honour for us to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations on the criminal case against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the accused are accused of involvement in organised crime, gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office, the funds generated from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often counterfeit invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the local government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have gone partly into the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal and partly into the private coffers of individual citizens.
According to the information provided by the investigating authorities, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the clubs are said not to have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were falsified.
The billing blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision to which companies the invoices should be issued was made on the tour north of Lake Balaton to which János István Lados was awarded the contract.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded bills of consumption in order to be able to issue bills based on these bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, and the Municipality of Budapest.
The majority of these accounts were manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, who, according to our information, was responsible for drafting the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer bar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag und Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the boss of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also contained serious errors in form and content.
A guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, is said to have accommodated 130 guests.
There were apparently no limits to the invoice counterfeiters ’ imagination when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering establishment whose accounts do not even mention the clients Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá, according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that the documents were forged when he was presented with documents by the prosecution during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly printed on the stamp".
Furthermore, apart from formal errors, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated a hundred people after having eleven rooms in total, which cannot possibly accommodate so many people, was also incorrect.
Also on the invoice had been stated catering, but the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The busy invoice forgers also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offers trips abroad, and so they indicated Hungary ’ s trips on the cash payment invoice, which also contradicted the company ’ s accounting practice.
As the investigation revealed, they have also included VAT on their invoices, even though travel agencies operating outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company only charges 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and the employees only issue invoices by machine, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made by the "accountants" was that, in one case, they had stated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the investment consultancy firm, the prosecution said.
Further formal errors - incorrect invoice format, incorrect stamp - were to be owed that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be unmasked as forgeries.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers affirmed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" was made by the forgers at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in the process of dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület is said to have eaten there - consequently, the mass administrator stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Consciously counterfeit
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they had to pay fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the executive director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious bills.
Biogate Kft. which is also in the process of liquidation is also said to have cooperated with the award of the contract: in 2003, the limited liability company is said to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with counterfeit invoices with a total value of HUF 5 million relating to services not provided.
There was no payment either, however, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, but the persons concerned have forgotten to note this in their documents.
The third group of accountants comprises persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company that cannot be found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computerised components for a total value of about HUF 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, was the purchaser of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he himself had collected their value.
It is said that the companies Fa ’ Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos ’ Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
In reality, however, none of these firms were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to a lack of contracts.
Nevertheless, he was able to profit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of the preparation of the company foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlasz and Y ’ Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices with a total value of HUF 14.2 million to the organizations on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa. Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor ’ s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as VAT.
Kubatov is even said to have misused the company Szi / Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to Biztos Pont's applications.
In January 2006, the Y ’ s Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért companies submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but misused these amounts.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft to the TMA.
Incidentally, these bills were secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the hearings, some defendants are now expected to make a confession about the procedure for falsifying invoices, as they had already been filed before the prosecution.
A sensation could be if Jáno ’ s principal defendant decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His information so far has been less detailed, and although he has promised on several occasions to give a full account of everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains as to whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have made a pact with him to compensate him for most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the supplementary allowance is prepared to accept responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that Zuschlag is now playing the "offended" game after his requests for mitigation of the detention and house arrest fell on deaf ears.
Whereas other criminals who have caused far greater damage with economic crimes and have not paid for them are at large, or at least under house arrest, Zuschlag is denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Beating - or Why We Are Willing to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and overvalue what is offered.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now discovered the neurological basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play the lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants could win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured with losers of the auction, in which the outbid of the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To substantiate their thesis, the economists in the Research Unit also conducted studies on the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their inserts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward if they emerged as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in case of a lost game.
So the only difference between the two groups was that the emphasis in one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the group playing "against losing" were prepared for higher stakes than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These justified so far the behavior observed with auctions only with the joy over winning, and / or the risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to imaging techniques, so we now have a third explanation, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the generic term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids (such as semen, vaginal secretions or saliva).
In any case, travellers are recommended vaccination against the A and B viruses, and there is no vaccine against the C virus.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear approximately two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that jaundice acts on a skin and in eyes, the stool becomes light, urine is dark, and recovery can proceed to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, around 1 million people die each year from the far more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten of those infected is on medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in good time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
The 30th of September is the World Day of Hepatitis, held in 2004 for the first time by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Like newest research results prove that the religious faith works as a kind of "painkiller", which already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Oxford University scientists have carried out an interesting experiment: they investigated the extent to which belief in God influences people's perception of pain, the British paper Telegraph reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using a brain-based scan technology, it has even been shown that Catholics could activate the part of their brain that regulates pain.
The study was the first in a research project involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the experiment, the test persons were connected to the left hand with a sparkling device, which delivered the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Ermine".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke among the faithful a kind of religious trance, while they chose da Vinci ’ s painting because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while viewing either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for", and they had felt "rest and peace".
While viewing the religious painting they reported about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo's work before their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced in the atheists with other strong images, one only had to find the corresponding photo.
"We have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing the faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases, ” Wright said.
After these excellent results, all that remains is the question of what effect a Madonna of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the regulation of the faithful ’ s pain.
Would the high quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you tell us about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it can be found in people ’ s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that ’ s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google ’ s managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets them be directed: These would overlook the very essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said that Google ’ s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users, thereby coming closer to the company ’ s original goal of “organizing all information around the world. ”
Schmidt said that after ten years of changing the world, Google is still only at the beginning of the information gathering process.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google were able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs were not yet able to do so because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which the search was made, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows visitors to save their own search history and access it later, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the so-called "Recommendations" are based on the same logic, with which the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
The users wonder, however, what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look up, what I do" - show some are concerned about the google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that is frightening, rather than the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom, or the revolt against power that many Internet users reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, where Google provided the Brazilian Government with information collected by the community site called 'Orkut', which also allowed paedophilia to be identified.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe a sigh of relief in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully took the FBI to court: according to this, Google cannot be forced to disclose information to the FBI on secret request under any constitutional provision.
(However, the Federal Government successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the law on the protection of minors passed years ago. However, it was withheld from the list of individual users and their web and search term lists for two months retrospectively.)
So Google ’ s image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear losing their privacy and intimacy by using Google ’ s services are castigating the company with the indignation that the conservative firms deserve.
Meanwhile, the American "geek" culture, which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if they are both fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require any identification codes from its users, and provides its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and program “package ” may seem far more attractive, youthful, and cool than the official practices of the software“ giant. ”
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has moved to the center of attention in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
In fact, "Web 2.0" is all about collaboration, meaning that users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can manage their profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, connecting them through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and finally integrating all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can have blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a series of other exemplary cases proves: Looking at the party photos of the past night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee is dismissed because he in his blog only too honestly gives vent to his anger about the management - one thing is certain: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he reveals about himself - this is how one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And those who try to keep something secret, or even to bypass Google ’ s monopoly, are welcome to do so – such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google ’ s search engine, but deliberately leaves no trace.
Quite a few people deliberately don ’ t register on community sites so that they can ’ t be found, but Google ’ s online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also deal with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore don ’ t generate the best possible user profile.
Public opinion, however, waits spellbound for Google to show its true face.
With a current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords / AdSense is threatening the revenue of advertising agencies, and the ever-faster introduction of services is a headache not only for Microsoft, but also for other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing opposite poles: For example, the corporate management has completely rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the company ’ s kindergarten had been doubled, and the management also said that the repeated feeding of the employees was too expensive. However, all this seems to be almost mild against the fact that Google even went to its knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed to an agreement according to which all dissident hits, or those that offend against good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could change a lot: While some think that Google's book and magazine scan and archiving project is now assuming proportions, that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, so others are rather concerned about the system "Health", which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, Doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building up a genetic database is already providing the next generation of Sci-Fi authors with the stuff - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian manner a future in which a person becomes frighteningly near thanks to data related to Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two youths suspected of helping to remove the traces, reported the spokesman of the police station Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people have confessed and are currently being accused of aiding and abetting.
According to information from the MTI news agency, they are two girls who are defending themselves at large.
Aid carries a term of imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old resident, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed for money.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had owed a larger sum of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the crime long in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon used and the circumstances surrounding its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange launches offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were formerly excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly state-owned.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer from the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The newspaper reports that so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this might even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to be CZK 5 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The Financial Crisis from the Perspective of European Newspapers
In their commentary on the ever-worsening international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European papers spoke of the "second 11 September".
We owe the global financial catastrophe to the American president, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to get his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also find the scapegoat in Washington.
According to "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush ’ s plan was not perfect, but now, following the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will have no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva-based "Daily Scoreboard".
Still, some governments could bail out their shaky financial institutions, and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers ’ money.
But if a domino effect is triggered and more banks fail, neither further injections nor other emergency measures will help.
In the long run, the EU would need to move beyond member states and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to ailing financial institutions, the Vienna newspaper "Der Standard" points out. Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concern that European taxpayers will have to dig deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis is becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
The "saviors" would not have to "wag" several hundred billion euros immediately, but it would be advisable to note in which case it would be sensible to touch taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not the obstacle of mimicking sensors from nature?
For example, that of the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired Nissan ’ s bumblebee engineers to create new accident avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the automobile guided biomimetic system BR23C, a miniature car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collision.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology, PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manoeuvre is purely instinctive.
"If it were not so, the car robot could not react fast enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they evade other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, unlike bees, it cannot go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the tyre's manoeuvrability.
Whereas the bees have an infinite number of possibilities here to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotation movement, i.e. acceleration and deceleration, of the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium-ion batteries, which are lighter and more energy-efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that what matters is the instinctive, intelligent response, rather than the processing of the data, and even less the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly.
It does not need to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so that it only needs a handful of KB memory each time.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan expects will be in production within the next ten years.
The technology could also be applied to GPS satellite navigation, by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles to the destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now we have the written version of the 700 billion dollar rescue package, which will be implemented in several stages and is aimed at the purchase of bad loans from banks.
In the first pass half of money should be issued.
At a meeting that ended after East Coast local time at midnight on Saturday, Congressmen reached agreement on a $700 billion bailout package after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the US House of Representatives, who said that the agreement simply needed to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the rescue package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the outcome: the program will be effective and efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about taking the helm of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not cause a flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the Chamber of Deputies votes first on the draft law to stabilise the economy in 2008, and then it is the Senate ’ s turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
But the program deviates from the Bush administration ’ s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent all at once on buying bad debt securities.
In the first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion will be spent, with 250 billion immediately available, after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of bad debt securities, and on the other 100 billion USD is to be decided by the president.
The programme will be reviewed by a special commission, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made either in an auction, or directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: "The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it be for large-scale bad money purchases, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, said Paulson.
But the heads of troubled banks, now reliant on state aid, can expect the government to cut back on their operations, which are loosely called "golden handshakes" overseas.
There will only be a cut in salaries in certain cases, and those cuts will depend on how the Treasury assists.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry buys in the course of an auction, then the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the retired bank head is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers ’ salaries are not exaggerated.
Part of the picture is that the existing Golden Handshake treaties are not changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers ’ salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented the measure.
The state gains equity rights in the participating banks, reducing the risk for taxpayers as they can participate as soon as the economy, and thus the rescued bank, is better off.
The bill requires the president to propose to Congress over the next five years how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
But there have been skeptics on both sides who have expressed doubts about the plan.
That is not what American citizens expect of us; the plan does not protect taxpayers ’ money at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
According to the Central Statistical Office, sales prices in Germany rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1% higher than in July 2008, and down 3.9% over the previous year.
Due to domestic price changes and the export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices increased only slightly, i.e. by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Also the selling prices of the processing industry rose only slightly - 0.1 per cent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 per cent) - primarily for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 per cent, with prices for shoes rising by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove up prices for chemicals and production considerably (1.6 percent).
Price decreases were recorded for crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and slightly for wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the processing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic industrial markets, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supplies, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the gas price increase introduced on 1 July.
If one considers the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year comparison, the prices in the crude oil processing rose most strongly (32.4 per cent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A price decline was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical appliances (0.3 percent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent year-on-year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the fixed goods sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sector prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector compared to the same period in 2007 (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent and a price reduction of 1.4 percent were noted for fixed goods.
Industrial export prices measured in forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decline of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency was 1.7 percent weaker than the euro, 7.1 percent weaker than the dollar, and compared to the exchange rate of August 2007, it was 7.5 percent stronger than the euro, and even 15.9 percent stronger than the dollar.
No more visa to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the entry into force of the US-based Hungarian visa agreement around 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now only depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in time overseas."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register in advance.
Starting today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington.
She will meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom she will present the "Mean Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain Support Bank Bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion rescue package for banks on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon deliberations on Sunday morning, Congress and government officials announced that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claiming to be better suited than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama has been able to extend his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain ’ s high, which brought him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to the Republican Convention, has also melted.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly approve the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain's economic vision as' obsolete '.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time of it (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an option."
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribed the establishment of a control commission for the Treasury Secretary, as well as the restriction of clearance for top-level managers - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the Secretary.
On Sunday, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking countries
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp became more self-confident - so commented "Der Spiegel" the poor performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-and-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the CSU ’ s dramatic defeat in his article "Bayerns Revolution vertilgt ihre Väter".
In the opinion of the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Hubert-Duo took office.
The Christian-social have renewed Bavarians for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break of the epoch is at the same time a problem of the Christian democracy, like also for Angela Merkel.
The CSU disaster did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already apparent almost exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Because already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU lands with 47.7 per cent and fell with it for the first time since the fifties under the fifty per cent.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections of 2005, still in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
Finally, the modernization consistently pursued by the CSU in the federal state has wiped out their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this as long as 40 years ago, but miscalculated considerably at the same time. However, the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain without consequences.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is conspicuous that in the last weeks almost the classical citizen groups expressed the largest distance to the CSU: the free occupations, the commercial middle class and voters with Abitur like university graduation.
Here the support of the CSU sank to under 40 per cent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily "Wer mit wem? Parteichefs zurückhaltend in Coalition Questions" reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it ’ s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party ’ s leaders barely looked into their cards.
Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) head Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is indeed possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could envisage a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor.
As he said, voters would have voted out of the way of the bowl, "Molterer".
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question.
However, Molterer has reacted cautiously to red bids.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally by the ÖVP.
BZÖ is boss Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red black, we are ready to take over government responsibility", said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, hosted this year by France, the country holding the EU Presidency, began today in Paris.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz ’ MEP, drew particular attention to the segregation of education, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and is the biggest obstacle to their right to be recognised.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz MEP ’ s press office, Járóka has pointed out that apart from discrimination in job search, the Roma are being squeezed out of the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can graduate from higher education."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which has a key role to play in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the EU member states ’ economies.
In the opinion of the MEPs it is important that these connections become aware of as broad a circle as possible - thus Roma and not infer Roma -.
Because the sooner a Roma pupil starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market increase; and through income tax and VAT, they contribute to national spending.
"As EU citizens, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped", said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, goal- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", Járóka said.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the Summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at both European and national level, in line with the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber and Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling yet; at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in office, but the question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% vote loss will be decided on the last weekend in October at the extraordinary party conference.
The much-scolded duo, however, already let it be known that they do not want to stick to their chairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which, one day after the "Bavarian tsunami", demanded personal consequences in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber they could secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole ruler" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern province, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor to Huber, Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the fact-finding team, which will hold exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and right-wing "Free Voters" on a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the list of "Free Voters" the Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance was first exploited by Huber ’ s Beckstein Duo, only to then mercilessly dismiss the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has pulled the strings from the background so far, will have an active role to play. Stoiber, the former prime minister and chairman of the CSU, called 28 September the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks to the CDU -- in his view, the CSU deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU, and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a great deal to the success at the national level in 2005, is not re-established with a joint effort, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU ’ s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
But what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko, opposition: 110, 0
In Sunday ’ s elections, no opposition deputy made it into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10 million inhabitants has been able to do without opposition for decades, the opposing party, gathered under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), earnestly hoped that Lukashenko, who had renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would this time "allow" some members of the opposition in parliament.
Therefore ODS has even refrained from the boycotts planned before.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports. Loans have even been taken out to ease the price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell the belt-trans gas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. Thus, in the background of the opposition ’ s expectations was the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections, caused a temporary easing of tension.
However, the OECD's rapid report on Monday already criticised the campaign - opposition figures must not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition is seeing an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, for example, and Minsk is even prepared to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse to recognise the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has been considering the two territories as independent for a month.
“We took two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun, ” Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, despite the fact that 'the powerful have become afraid of allowing even one opposition member into parliament'.
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in the light of the results, but is rather trying to make the need for economic reform clear to the voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put obstacles in our way of distribution, but I see that more and more people support change, even the older ones," Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the creation of social security.
"Thanks to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before" social security ", reminiscent of the silence of a cemetery, begins to crumble," said Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe in deeds, not words." The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on we will have breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
Starting today, the measure against those smart eggs that first stamp and then go during working hours coffee drinking will come into force.
The new Anti-Laziness Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
">" Rotating doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services ", said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism, "stresses Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the institution ends in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "the choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all there is no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
Meeting of the Supreme Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
of Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months, the absences of civil servants have been reduced to 50%, that is to say, 60.000 more people per year are present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their pay" dynamics - according to the Minister - were in the last 8 "10 years twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to oppose Brunetta ’ s “decree ” as part of the Codacon-sponsored appeal.
"While the Minister for the Civil Service profiles himself with figures about lower absences at work - so writes the consumer center - the people of the 'active lazy' continues to grow.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree. "
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is essential"
Every day, 2500 occupational accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For the year 2007 the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, in all the provinces of Italy, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will mark the 58th National Day for the Victims of Occupational Accidents in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of recent days confirm how crucial the question of prevention in the workplace is", confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to assistance for the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"An indignant 'Basta' has arisen; understandable in the case of tragedies which, in terms of their magnitude, cause quite a stir in the media and public sympathy. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events which can even repeat themselves in their own dynamic."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
Of particular importance are the many initiatives aimed at raising the awareness of young people who feed on the world of work in school settings.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to divert attention from its social seriousness; a legislative norm must be enforced and improved.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards definite rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on occupational accidents seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasizes President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this' positive tendency 'to mean less attention, which is what causes the tragedy in the end."
"We believe that, basically, we do not do enough to combat the phenomenon of accidents, and we can fight it through various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary in our opinion - so Mercandelli; in addition, stronger measures for the clearing-up of the workers, who already begin in the school ".
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and public opinion awareness.
But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency is called for ".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration in the level of protection for victims of industrial accidents" and denounced "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, decided from time to time by a legislator".
Mp3 in Player under indictment: Danger of hearing impairment
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable devices, such as MP3 Players, can result in permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report circulated today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
"It is clear from the report - it says in a note - that 5% of those who listen to loud music with portable music equipment for at least five years a week for longer than an hour a day risk permanent loss of hearing".
"I am worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - so it is called on the part of the Eu - a clear risk shows up, which urges to fast acting.
What really matters is to make consumers aware and to make this information public.
In the light of this scientific knowledge, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology. "
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to consider the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - concludes the EU Communication - confirm that there is justifiable concern and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders, will now investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music equipment and similar devices."
There is currently already a European standard limiting the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB. Concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise exposure.
This damage can be very limited by using solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the Eu Scientific Committee points out that when users of portable music devices listen to loud music (louder than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at work have already been exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would therefore affect 5% 10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, it is supposed to be over in March, and we will take stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital, Rome, which met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the Municipal and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno stresses. "It will put forward proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders will remain the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of competences, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be dissolved, since such a project must have a time-bound end point.
In June, the Mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission. "
Anyone who questions the competence of the Commission, because its opinion is not binding, Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali ’ s Commission does, it delivers quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the day-to-day problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to keep an eye on a longer period of time in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city from a deeper perspective. "
The Mayor of Rome stresses that "this commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a qualitative leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama - the first anti American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is keen to be considered independent, has written: "Barack Obama will be the second anti American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who through his decisions decimated the economy of the United States and cultivated relationships with the enemy Islam (and still does so today as a private individual). "
The attacks on Obama are becoming increasingly violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators! ".
In fact, these attacks don ’ t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don ’ t answer the voters ’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win by a large margin.
In this case too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the far south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the voting booth will we know whom the true American patriot will vote for.
Here comes a mentality of the USA to light, which was kept hidden to the last.
"Say what you will, then we will decide for whom we will make our sign, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4 500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, for the majority, Iraq remains Bush ’ s weak point.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: you can feel the cuts in the newspapers, and many accuse the Internet of being the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control over the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not express any real concern for the overall credibility of the information concerning those responsible.
They do not feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to this are the major problems arising from the cuts made to the newsroom, the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that has to be solved - according to the interviewed journalists - if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from not shrinking substantially.
Today, the American journalist is filled with a clear but complicated pessimism.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors in the printing press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, there are even about 65% of executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the Web is heading.
The most important publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology in the hope that "it will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between newsroom editors and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with 'safety at work'.
Farm managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
The figure for journalists is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", editor's note) is always a hot topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer as they please and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief very often receive very high wages, while the editor can sometimes only get EUR 10,000 per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As far as holidays are concerned, things get complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, and finally, after a certain number of years, 15 days of holidays.
But, as they admit, American journalists often become "sick" during the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF JUSTICE IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Trial Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the estate agent who asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for Bankrot in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol.
In the course of the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was transformed into a compulsory stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the estate agent to move from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (which the public prosecutor ’ s office had opposed) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House ’ s $700 billion austerity package: a large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday ’ s edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis is dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and the neoconservative party, which is hostile to “those in Washington ” and the financial world and is winning voters, especially in the south and the center of the state.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
The example I have just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even represents: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events which, under these new conditions, are finally taking shape and coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the outrageous renaissance of the state combined with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means the decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, which also represent an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism thus appears to have been sidelined and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been provided by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the USA is in the economic position to save itself without external help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions that cannot be overestimated - under certain circumstances - to which no other international organization and no market will be able to fall back in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the growing importance recently attached in the economy to a very closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered into a networked empire, a realm of constantly differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we suddenly have to find out how our future will depend more and more on the essentially material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, but they are nevertheless linked to a closely circumscribed piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, those who have such a territory have an advantage over those who live in a cropless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which requires a brief insertion.
Who says territory, who says government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation against the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more worrying aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, an image of inexpediency, a sense of distance, all directed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
This seems to pave the way for the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content presents itself to the majority as increasingly foreign and outdated.
The demand for leadership thus fuels underground a ramified but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden upheaval of the collective mood of recent times: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, through the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American deputies against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their stature, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is going on today in the lower social strata of the West, which is still intensified by the financial crisis and driven to an extreme.
In view of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But it is certainly not to keep one's eyes wide open.
The super glue that lets go up walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now appears to have almost reached its destination.
Using an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100-kg body to a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon - nanotubes.
"The principle of adhesive can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged in a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the durability of the reptile feet and at the same time "easily removes from the wall," according to Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
ALONG WALLS? "This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Like Spiderman rising from the walls? Maybe, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating use, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall into the field of space travel.
So for the moment the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER WAY OF RESEARCH - also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibres that, like hair moving on a surface, cleans itself of dust and thus always retains perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are mainly consumed in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin abundance, can cause serious damage to health if taken at the same time as certain essential medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices in combination with medication. At the 236th Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to such an extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs, such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
DANGEROUS MEDICATIONS - The same drug agency warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, stressing to pay attention to what is consumed in connection with drugs such as diazepan or metadone.
IT'S NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUITS - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal by Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately passed on to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the leaflet and, if there are still uncertainties, not to be shy to ask a pharmacist or doctor, "emphasizes the expert of Ansa bureau.
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration ’ s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in an editorial in the New York Times that this second event was more crucial to US history than the attacks.
A prediction that received no small amount of polemics as an answer, and which was reproached to the economist years later, but which now proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the Enron and Worldcom scandals has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti geous Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; as a free replacement for Microsoft Office, open source software is gaining a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some novelties to the public: in addition to a revised and now more spartan designed start menu, finally a fundamentally guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x has been achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
The compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice, was also emphasized.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the ability to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, making it easier to send by email, including the ability to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while preserving the page ’ s original appearance.
"Hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical Adobe ® format graphics with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multi-handed by different users, avoiding conflicts in case of changes; in the case of the word processor, each processor is assigned a color to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Apart from Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, you can have the Installation CD sent to your home or office.
If, however, the free of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed the big hit: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
Indeed, there is not even a lack of training, which is an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program, which aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, for the creation of presentations as with PowerPoint; Dbase for the operation of databases in place of the more well-known Access; and Draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a target that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Also Kohl tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up in the framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is classified third and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The daily newspaper L'Equipe published the news on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth rider to have tested positive for Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this had already been the case for the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl ’ s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay / Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest and also notified the Austrian authorities according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and claimed the jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRATION TOPIC: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RACISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of the emigrants has recently become one of the favorite countries for immigrants", which are received only with reluctance.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is the question asked by the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely to the issue of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of biscuits.
The case testifies to what The Times calls "the paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "the most integration and employment opportunities" exist, yet "the highest level of anti-immigrant sentiments and the greatest support for the Lega Nord".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, The Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only that.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and to speed up the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement also underlined by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "At a meeting at the Quirinal, Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope for cooperation between Church and State in the fight against racism."
Female students victims of up to 900 €per room high rental prices
The housing market for students is not crises.
According to the latest study by Sunia, the Tenants Union, a single room can cost a student up to €900 in Milan, €700 in Florence, €650 in Naples and €600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious characteristics: entire flocks of students are effectively losing their right to study, since their families are not able to support them at this level", says Laura Mariani, responsible for Sunia. "In these cities, the great demand on the part of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, lack of registrations, no rental price limit, illegal subletting.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures leading to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
A closer look at the study reveals that in Milan, a place to sleep in the Brianza district requires around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts, or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350 / 400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the districts around the university, 250 / 280 euros are needed for a place to sleep, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Just a little lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who go to the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar districts.
In Naples, it takes 300 to 450 euros for a bed, and 400 to 600 euros for a room in the most expensive neighborhoods, Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
A place to sleep in Bari costs 250 Euro, a single room at least 350 Euro.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater impact on the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25% higher than the average are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of excluding cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-hall complexes in the periphery, in the long run means the death of the single-screen cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of a cultural crime.
Mostly historical places full of memories are concerned, "it is like losing a friend with whom you have covered a stretch of road full of emotions", according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who 20 years ago won him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak volumes: in the last five years, the enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas has had to close; this has been largely borne by the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia and Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is in these three regions that the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the list, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way", says Paolo Protti, the president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but the first priority is the preservation of the already existing one, because if a hall in the city closes, not all of its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the Trade Association of the External Eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from an ethical moral standpoint that the government does not respect existing laws.
To maintain the sector, between EUR 16 and 18 million per year would be needed ".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that decided to protect the old cinemas through an agreement between the Municipality and Anec, due to the fears about the old cinemas; this is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged, there will also be tax advantages for cinema operators and benefits for the public in terms of public transport: it will be permitted to enter the areas of the city centre with reduced traffic charges and to park at a cheaper rate.
"It is a good initiative", said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also come up with new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of multiplex halls, because today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important theme for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been toying with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; passing by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations made this morning by the Anti-mafia Association of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro for involvement in mafia business are serious.
Also handcuffed was Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan ’ s boss, had already been convicted for involvement in Mafia criminal organizations, at the time for a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm", the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for counselling activities".
"Thus it was made possible for the mafia group - according to the judges - to enter the town halls by official means and to participate in determining the policy of the public administration."
Agazio Loiero, president of the Regional Committee of Calabria, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to find connections between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who keep a clean slate. "
This morning ’ s arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 - and even then because of alleged links between organised crime and the local administration - the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the coalition of the right wing after the runoff in May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He then referred the case to Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning ’ s arrest warrant, state that the Piromalli ’ s clan had even dared to request a change to the A3.
From an interception in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has been shown to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - whereby the actions of the public administration have become identical with the interests of this clan. "
When the energy springs from the waves, the big ones suddenly rise
It is an inexhaustible source of money that covers over 70% of the planet ’ s surface, and only now do the world ’ s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents, and tides are the new renewable energy sources that all now look to, and even seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been under consideration and studied for 70 years; it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of ocean energy was lost, but now environmental organizations and the increased price of oil are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world ’ s energy needs could be met by energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice the amount of energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there were currents and tides.
Giants at the attack.
The first company to rely on ocean energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, it is now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that rely on marine energy production.
"Chevron is exploring these technologies," the Wall Street Journal spokesman for a company known to the U.S. giant said, "and is evaluating the opportunity to work with us."
This is about obtaining a license from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that should not be underestimated, especially when one considers that in Alaska in particular oil is still being extracted by the USA and that President Bush only recently started plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Technologies still to be improved.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the move, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland have been of a rather small scale and do not appear to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, large-scale energy production requires technologies that have a far greater impact on the environment.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by means of pistons and cylinders within the floats.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
So far, there are four planned plants of this type, which are only waiting for government approval, and some of the energy produced could also be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, meanwhile, already produces energy for a merchandise store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in New York ’ s East River.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotary motion.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, the potential that lies in the tides deserves special attention at the moment.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and are therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
