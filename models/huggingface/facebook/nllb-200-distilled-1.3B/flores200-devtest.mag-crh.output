This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already abundant, but provides details that fossils cannot usually color and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the wings of these animals were shaggy-brown above and pear or carotenoid underneath.

Because dinosaurs did not have a well-developed wing shaft, called a rachis, but had other wing features - barbs and barbels - researchers speculated that rachis were likely to evolve later evolutionarily to have these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were used for temperature regulation or performance rather than in flight. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the adult specimen shows wings rather than the underside of a chuja.

He found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of the stars in the system is governed by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic transition.

Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, was found in Blue Ash, Ohio, a suburb about 15 miles north of Cincinnati, lying on the ground on the side of the road in a T-shirt and underwear, apparently in a heavily medicated state.
He directed the officer to his black Oldsmobile Intrigue which was 500 feet away.

The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms contain a proton and an electron).
Two dry grains rolled together and then, with clean wet hands, squeezed them into a ball.

Their secret to success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat holds that prevents them from competing with others.
The lion is the most social of cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride is made up of one to three related adult males, as well as thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely associated with each other due to having a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion Pride behaves very much like a pack of wolves or dogs, the animals behave surprisingly similarly to lions (but not other large cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, can climb tigers (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the strength of a stronger human.

The native population has not changed at all, they still need adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.

Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Agora's fame began around 400 AD as a center of luxury, and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The situation further declined during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.

Sustainable agriculture is agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
️Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system, which uses seeds saved in that environmental zone in combination with crop cycles or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subculture may be special due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of all elements.

One of the most common methods used to explain the importance of socialization is to note some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse when they were growing up.

All feral children must have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children display almost entirely caring animal-like behaviors (within physical limits), such as fear or indifference to humans.

Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that assists people who are gaining experience learning new things such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.

We see the foster care system as a safety zone for all these children.
Our parental care system is understood to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Parent-care is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were first taken.
The Internet serves as a link between both mass communication and interactive communication.
The Internet is taking on additional dimensions in terms of specific properties, usage and satisfaction.

Individual participation andcontinuous relationships were also identified as new motivational factors by Eghami and McCord (1998) when they examined the reactions of viewers to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial activity, which last for a few milliseconds.

Oliver Sachs indicated in his paper The Presidential Speech that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to correctly assess honesty.
He has also argued that such a capacity to explain human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection now removes apparent variation from the group.
Isolation and recombination alter the variation between the two groups in each generation.
In savannas, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty meeting their amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.

The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and pulses, but primates like us find them difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Unlike the agora, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only readily digestible, but they provide high amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised that our suppliers solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the same way as chimpanzees do on savannah today.

If you can reset the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of this room, which you can comfortably exit the bed to turn off.
All other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of liquid things (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to urinate.
The amount of peace within a person is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and soul.

Navies' job has traditionally been to ensure that their countries maintain the ability to move their people and goods, while simultaneously, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
The German Navy was trying to stop this traffic, primarily using U-boats.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to win over Britain because it had the rest of Europe.

Older cultures and tribes have started keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed mountains or other grazing areas, which were especially similar to the more widely known herdsmen, which were children or adolescents.

150 and 200 copies were made at night, now known as "Dunlop Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document is given by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on 6 July to George Washington, who read the agora to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
25 Dunlop Broadsides are still extant which are the oldest surviving copies of the document. No original handwritten copies have survived.

Naturalistics and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-perpetuating oscillators that will continue periods of free-running cycling even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase experiments were one of the major suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He performed two experiments to either label the protein of the phase with DNA with radioactive phosphorus in the phase or with radioactive sulfur.
The mutation can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether or not the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Mutations in only germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while elsewhere mutations can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.

Transport systems generate such complaints, that they fail on a daily basis? that transport engineers are just incompetent? or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers behave within reasonably consistent ranges; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable constancy and can be represented mathematically roughly.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.

The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was still used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed Agora and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave Agora after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badia and Agora was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders, who established the Ozza trading base.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.

Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on Upolu Island and the population of the Aor is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
