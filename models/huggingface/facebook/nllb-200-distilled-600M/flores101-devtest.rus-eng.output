Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widely accepted theory, but it also provides details that can't usually be obtained from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say the animal's fur was brownish brown above, and pale below or carotenoid pigmented.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed stem called a rachis, but still have other distinctive features  bearded and bearded  researchers have concluded that rachis likely appeared later by evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control and demonstration.
The researchers suggested that although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen had the tail of an adult, not a chicken's.
A car was detonated near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to mimic observations of the Milky Way in the Arrow.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the Milky Way galaxy in the Milky Way.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, much of the dark matter around the galaxy is in the shape of an orel and consists of a large number of small particles.

In a study in the southern African region of KwaZulu-Natal , Dr. Tony Moll was able to detect extremely high drug resistance (XDR-TB) tuberculosis .
In an interview, he said the new strain "is a very high concern, as it leads to a very high mortality rate".

In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: the voter closes in a booth and puts a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the official verifies the identity of the voter, he or she leaves the envelope in the polling station and signs on the voter list.
French electoral laws have a pretty strict system.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added to them other than those of the people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been properly counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the entire process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with a special procedure.

He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Later, the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged Adéko with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any testimony can be distorted because her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have found the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be on the verge of danger by publishing photos and other information about suspects".
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for prosecuting the case, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment is handed down.
The document, according to the leak, will deal with the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly involved the future condition of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The arrows involved in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
As part of the NPWS partnership with the Australian Sports Shooter Association (NSW), the Association of Sports Shooters has recruited qualified volunteers to help with the shooting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage at the National Park Service, four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety instruction.
Yesterday, Martea took the oath of office of the new Interim Electoral Council (ITC), which consists of nine members.
This is Martey's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous Interim Election Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There were about 60 cases of overheating of failed iPods, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 clusters associated with these devices.
Last week, the Department of Economics, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "unseemly".
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report "very regrettable".
At 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) there was an earthquake in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has stolen a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held hostage Hong Kong tourists.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been declared dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had been flushed into the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, in his spare time, he began investigating premature births.
His study showed that if the hormone is injected, it can increase the maturation of the baby's lungs during the developmental period.
According to Xinhua, on Wednesday, state investigators discovered two on-board autographs, or, in other words, "black boxes".
The wrestlers also paid tribute to the moon.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon became the first Queen of the Extreme. She was my first manager. The moon died on the night of two moons. It's a unique event, just like her.
Dustin "Goldast" Runnels said, "The moon was as plague-like as I was... maybe even more plague-like... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in the best place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed her opinion that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed agree and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The survey found that 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical form is now in doubt.
He couldn't take the pain medication because it's banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest known simple number to date.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water to Earth and the source of organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political talk and stupidity".
He's supposed to run for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that the US Federal Aviation Administration has assured will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of old technology based on ground-based radar, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
There's no additional transportation in Wembley, no ground trains, and no parking and interception on the surface.
Fears of a lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A description of the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, says that a new species of bird has appeared in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of Darwin's endemic snail (Geospiza fortes) with the migrating cactus snail (Geospiza conirostris), the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer.
Gold can be shaped in any shape, it can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be woven and plated, or it can be rolled or rolled.
It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "face manuscripts".
It's called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice varies depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH indicator is determined by the degree of hydrogen ion saturation (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions  are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
You can get a new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then blend the balls with your clean, wet hands.
The weight on your hands will react with the upper layer, which will be unusual, and then form a shell-like shape.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a sink toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
The surviving fragments of sewer systems were found in the houses of Minoan towns on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space takes the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space, and scientists are using telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision to some extent.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways, and the most important thing the wheel has done for us is it has given us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Underneath them are more medium-sized cats that eat small prey from rabbits to antelope and deer.
And finally, many little cats (including strolling domestic cats) eat and hunt for much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat type does that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of one to three adult males, as well as females and young, which can reach thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion praids behave very similarly to wolf herds or dogs  animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous to their victims.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as the lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-blown roar of a lion, but more like the shouting of words that are not clear.
Survivors love to eat small animals, and if they do, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the octopus preys on are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the animal trail and find prey by sniffing through the smell of its movement through the earth.
They have excellent night vision and can move almost unnoticed, and the survivors trace the prey by blending in with the environment and then they rush for prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or changes from those it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all  it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it's impossible to say they're the same species.
We call this the formation of species, the emergence of new species, and species formation is a necessary consequence and an extremely important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed on the sun by photosynthesis, and they also shade.
We build our houses and we make our clothes from plants, and most of our food is plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosaic was the most formidable predator of its time, so it was afraid of no one but other mosaics.
His long jaws were dotted with more than 70 sharp teeth, and there was an extra row on his back, so those who met him on his way had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was split, and he ate turtles, big fish, other mosas, and he could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus could not match it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts, such as caban, peacock, snail, and a rodent such as sunflower.
There was another difference: while the poor and the poor ate in chairs, the rich enjoyed having their cake together while they were eating on their sides.
The ancient Romans' diet could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a sanctuary for each of the gods, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods in ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as elements of the temple, special pyramid-shaped towers called "zikkurates" were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of much importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops had open shelves that went out.
The land of Canaan was not forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse saga tells of Erik Ridge being expelled from Iceland for murder, and moving westward, he discovered Greenland and named it.
But regardless of its discovery, it was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Treasure of the Nation", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it reads: "The True Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days this large parchment document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was folded for convenient storage.
So it's quite possible that the recording was added just as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not.
It was under the control of the French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France and the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the forces of Free France and the Americans liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
Civilization is a separate culture, the bearers of which are a fairly large group of people living and working together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil" and is related to the Latin words civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of society in a certain way.
Civilization culture involves the transfer of knowledge through several generations, the continuous cultural presence and continuous distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen states, in accordance with the Articles of Confederation, formed a weak central government for the first time, with Congress as the sole governing body.
Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and since there was no nationwide executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities who often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all its acts.
It also had no authority to repeal state tax laws or tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles required the unanimous approval of all states, but the states were so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One auto racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is  Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its membership in a cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
Taiwan dates back many years to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by wrote the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Tsing government signed the Simonosek Treaty, which ceded the rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihwatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Chambers.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for static photography in the world is 35mm, and that was the dominant size of the film at the dawn of the analogue era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio inherited the size of the digital camera image.
The 35-millimeter format is actually a bit confusing, it's 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small integers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The often-used and often-mocked rule of thirds  is a simple recommendation that creates a dynamic while maintaining a certain amount of order in the image.
It says that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was the object of intense attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her pervasive power touched everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church money exists for that very purpose.
The center of church power has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question the validity of this dogma.
Shortly after the start of the war, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated the widely accepted international laws set forth in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean sectors, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unhindered underwater military action.
Most citizens and peoples in the 1920s were pacifists and isolationists.
Knowing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted an offer to work for Edison in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique way of denoting periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period there were fierce military actions between many noble men fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history, with thousands of people killed fighting for a seat on the throne in a large palace in Sian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, jobs were opened up for all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because ranks are based on qualities, not on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressive workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics not related to the worldly life. He often visited a cave that became known as the "Hira" on Mount Noor (the light) for meditation.
Well, the cave that has survived to this day gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's very hard to detect, even for someone who knows it exists.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above the head and the many mountains around it, and from the depths of the cave, only a very small part of the world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Heops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives of Heops and his relatives.
The upward movement of the snout marks looks like a V, and the downward movement of the snout marks like a clamp or square without a bottom.
"Up" means you have to start at the tip and move the plunger forward, and "down" means you have to start where your hand holds the plunger and move it back.
The movement of the plunger upward usually produces a softer sound, while the movement of the plunger downward is stronger and more intense.
You can draw your own stripes, but remember that the stripes are printed for musical reasons, and they usually have to be followed.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of angry women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Maria-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their windows wide.
At some point, one of the members of this crowd slapped the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in the presence of a frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay most of the expenses and interest on the bond loans that were transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street bankers.
Of course, the surplus profits from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led them to create the Order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the XI, XII and XIII centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages replaced earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted viewpoint, ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destinies are driven by the fundamental logic of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technology development is virtually untouched by cultural or political influence and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties, not society.
For example, you could say that the automobile is a necessary factor in the development of roads.
However, the national road network is economically unprofitable for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to an increase in road traffic accidents, which leads to the invention of new health care treatments for injuries.
Romanticism was largely a cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture associated with it emerged that, in harmony with the place of residence of the given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than the goods offered on the Byzantine markets.
At this point, the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style flourished between the XXI century and the XIV century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles may lag by 25 to 30 years.
The Western European style began to develop in the late Middle Ages, and one of the greatest achievements of the time was the use of buttons to attach clothes.
Natural agriculture  is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, system of farming that uses seeds of plants growing in this ecosystem, along with the use of crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in agriculture for food, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they are undercut by society's standards, and allow those people to define who they are.
Subcultures may differ based on age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people they are composed of.
Characteristics that define a subculture as separate can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their belonging through their unique and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate a few unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of attention, mismatch or deliberate abuse, have not been able to communicate with adults during their adulthood.
Some children are isolated from humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases, such rejection of their child is the result of their parents' failure to accept their child's serious intellectual or physical inferiority.
Street children may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before fleeing or being abandoned.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some lived in the wild on their own.
If he is fully raised by animals instead of humans, the wild child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost in everything similar to the particular animal that raised him  for example, his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more interesting, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a form of assistance to those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
In other words, teacher  is a form of scaffolding, but it's also a Scrapyard in Microsoft Office.
Virtual learning aid is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that students might find too difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Children should not grow up in a environment where there is no education, care, or education, but they grow up.
We consider the foster care system safe for children.
Our care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The patronage education should provide for all the needs that were missing in the house from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scope in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, the idea that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivators for using the Internet is expressed (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contacts" were also called new motivational aspects by Emmy and McCord (1998) when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting the microgenerations  of a person's movements of several milliseconds in length.
In particular, it is argued that a person's lie can be determined by correctly interpreting his micro-expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
He suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies conducted in the 20th century have shown that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation brings in a new genetic variation, while selection takes it out of the set of variations that are manifesting.
Segregation and recombination with each generation drags variations between the two pools.
In a savannas with a digestive system like humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs at the expense of the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences such as slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and beans, but they're poorly assimilated by primates like us if they're not cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (anthocytes, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of protein, containing all the basic amino acids.
Given all of this, it's no surprise that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" much as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (1060 minutes).
It's easy to do with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to your senses and not wake you up completely.
If you find that you're re-establishing your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include taking large amounts of fluid (in particular water or tea, a known urine-retardant) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force you have, and each person has the potential to experience absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
The energy of kundalini (enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is aroused through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The Yoga of the Gods is the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are launched and the consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years, and it would be fought in real life using an indirect army on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other parts of the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian platsdam.
However, these plans became inactive almost overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the occupation of Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The traditional job of seafarers is to ensure the ability of a country to move its people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Company during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop the movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have milk, wool, meat, and skin under their control.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pasture areas, often overseen by kosopasses, usually children or adolescents, which is similar to the more common herd activity.
The roads for transport were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the wedgeways were only parallel tree trunks, they allowed horses to carry larger loads and at a higher speed than the slightly more rugged roads of the time.
The use of spades was long established to hold the rails in place, but later it became clear that the rails were more efficient with a railway made of iron from above.
This became common practice, but the iron led to more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In 1767 the first railways were built entirely of iron.
The first known form of transportation was foot travel, and people began walking just two million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus (which means straight man).
For their Australopithecus ancestors, straight walking was not so common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the remains of Australopithecus from the age of 4,23,9 million years ago, although perhaps the sahelanthrop walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living with a greater environmental concern, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to ease the suffering a little bit.
It's usually like treating symptoms, and if we need more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and fix it.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly under the influence of human scientific and technological progress, and the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle have made the problems more widespread.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, the manuscript, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing workshop.
Overnight, 150 200 copies were made, now known as "Danlap leaflets".
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read to his troops in New York.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one of the groups of dinosaurs that survived to this day is called birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are able to fly.
But there's a lot more to say about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two back legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information processing, which is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits"  or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
It can be difficult to spot oral poisoning immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to diagnose quickly.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of a drug or toxic household chemical.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "jock" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from the ancient bed bugs known as insects, which are perfectly adapted to parasitic behavior in humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species adapted to live in their owner's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making multiple sclerosis the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that multiple sclerosis affects twice as many women as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their interests or in the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adopting or adopting, biological parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world is organized using the scientific method, which is actually the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), questioning and observation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their development through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a reaction to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle autonomously over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, marking the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus and the radioactive grey protein of the phage.
Mutations can cause a wide variety of results, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected slice of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can pass on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism is of interest to those who enjoy nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and information on ecosystems.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns to go to work, and people who have just left work are passing by.
In this active transport movement, everyone is connected and maintained by a transport system based on personal vehicles.
Now, science shows that the huge hydrocarbon economy has influenced one of the stable states of the biosphere that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do we get so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of transport flows.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of traffic because you can't predict the behavior of the driver with a hundred percent probability.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often fairly systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better picture transport flow, the relationships between three main quantities were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made them easier to escape from enemies, to find food, and to find partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more shelter from predators.
The stork and the stork are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems like a good idea, because we can't feel the Earth moving, can we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers to our oceans flows from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza never exceeded.
In the new kingdom, the ancient Egyptians were admired for the monuments they had built over a thousand years ago.
The Vatican has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in pure form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also assumed that they would pass into a new state to produce what we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of the smallest particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them can fit in the end of this sentence.
Thus, pencils became a good friend to many people when they first appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil lost its original status and became less common.
Now people are texting on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a thumbnail.
You can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard, with the advent of more new technology.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that for many protons and neutrons to be in the same nucleus, energy is needed.
It's like lifting a heavy cart up a hill, and then the nuclear fission releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with or without small impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km under the continents.
It's thinner under the moon seas and thicker under the hills.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner, and the lava is easier to climb to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding what makes people act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate within them as they grow older.
These theories deal with what makes specific people want to do what they do, and what makes their environment do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content  are the Maslow Need Pyramid and the Herzberg Two-Factor Motivation Theory.
There are usually two types of behavior when managers start to lead people who were once their peers.
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to discipline, to evaluate the results of their work, to allocate responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and take it for himself.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams follow the same skill standards as regular teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often perform the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They're usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which isn't always understandable by local management.
The presence of this "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasta, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is a team of leaders that reports to each participant.
Why do organizations go through the laborious process of creating self-learning organizations? One of the goals of applying self-learning concepts to practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional units of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can be demonstrated.
As a result, the organization's concerted efforts to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that will serve the interests of the client.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and experience building.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
And this neurobiology data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and this narrows the scope of the study, and it gets a lot more accurate.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is being used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, injuries, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
It provides us with a huge amount of data and material to create imitative models that help us understand the processes that are happening in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science that looks at machine learning and machine behavior and the "advancement" of intelligence.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples: monitoring, planning and scheduling, response to diagnoses and customer questions, and facial recognition, handwriting and voice.
These questions are divided into disciplines that are designed to solve the problems we face in our lives.
Nowadays, AI is often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being embedded in some home computer and video game software applications.
School tours are very important for any classroom, and often teachers want to take their students to places they can't get to by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Putting a tour in a virtual space for public view  is also a great way to refresh the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year that website is updated, but access to the old versions still remains  they serve as a memorable album.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blog using sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to audience attendance.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
The blog also "makes students understand the world better". Students are inspired to be smart and interesting, drawing the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to expand their knowledge acquisition beyond the traditional school day.
Using blogs properly can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical, and by actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in the context of others' work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital with a huge number of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and north is a haven of pristine natural beauty for Muscogee and surrounding areas.
All of this and more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some of them are almost unpopulated.
A surprising comparison of the population: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gamma opened the way through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual family situation.
It 's also good to wear a ring (just not too expensive to look like).
Women should realize that because of cultural differences, they may feel that they are being harassed, that women are often being persecuted, that they are being held by the hand, and so on.
Be firm and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (that's not acceptable regardless of your culture!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians and Merenians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Ed Dar El Baida, and the Spanish traders who established trading bases here named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping spots in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as taxes, pottery, leather goods, garments and a wide variety of other crafts, but all this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, information on any trips outside Goma should be clarified in advance to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyragongo volcano, and you can also see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can take a motor taxi in Goma, which costs 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for exotic far-off land.
Today, Tombuctù is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat from desert sands.
One of the most important stops was made here during the filming of Henry Louis Gates's "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is predominantly Arab in color, not African.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered by the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of  19,500 km2; it has 14 different ecoregions, each of which is a habitat of different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading among South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, this park has a daily fee for its protection and visitation.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South Africa's national parks either selectively or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place many tourists consider their main focus.
The verandah of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline is compared to a glittering column diagram, highlighted by the waters of Victoria Bay.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head for the coast of the Jilong Peninsula, which is across the street.
Most of the urban areas of Hong Kong Island are concentrated on the sea-coastal land on the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove swamps stretching from the coast to the continent in Bangladesh and India for 80 km (50 mi).
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps  they are also some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and according to current estimates, its territory is home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer.
Buses depart from the inter-districts bus station (beyond the river) throughout the day, although most, especially eastbound and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, convenient and reliable Japanese Coaster buses.
The route  is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 nultrooms) and Punakha (200 nultrooms).
The bridge across the Oiapoque River is a vantage bridge that spans the Oiapoque River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
These two towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes of traffic 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge's height is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection sites are expected to be completed.
The Guarini were the largest indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced natural agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various local tribes, such as the Guaikuru and the Paiaguas, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "huge province of the East Indies", was created by the Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams in the world, as well as the best players in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Less major tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
For news on polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association's website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is in Port Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted on the islands, and the credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; please explain in advance to the owners which payment method is acceptable.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is almost impossible to exchange outside of the Falkland Islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures above 30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than what the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rain" and "dry" seasons here: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, nature is still wild, so animals need not be fed or disturbed.
The park administration warns against getting closer than 100 yards to bears and wolves, and no more than 25 yards to any other wildlife!
No matter how meek they may appear, bison, elk, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep the distance they need to, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so keep them private.
Also, bear in mind that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, killing about 200 American and German sailors.
During the Maoist movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader of Tupua, Tamses Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here because Oakland is located on the shores of two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded by trees like the Putucava.
In the central area of Oakland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers are located in Waitemath Bay, Tamaki Drive beaches have spread.
It's a crowded family beach with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste.
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better transported.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, you'll find bottled water.
The idea of flat white is not well understood by Australians. "Little black" is an espresso, a cappuccino served with a high layer of whipped cream (not with a foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and while fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
There are a lot of trips to the reef year round, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the instructions of the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cuboid is found near beaches and river mouths north of the 1770s from October to April.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The rocky crocodiles do not live in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travellers to avoid worrying about where to stay when they arrive.
Tour agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a tour agent and other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Tour agents usually sell package offers that include breakfast, airport transfer or even combined packages that include a flight and hotel accommodation.
They may also keep your booking if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants spend the night on the festival grounds, and most consider it a must-have part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive in advance to find a campsite near the music.
Remember, even if the music on the main stages is over, there may be venues at the festival where the music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, learn about the location of the cabin, as walking on ice can cause quite a scary noise that can interfere with sleep for the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city walks.
Usually casinos make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time and money as possible in the establishment, where there are no windows or clocks, and the exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and not leave the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness clouds the mind, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone who is going to travel through high-altitude areas or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
On the ice and snow roads, friction is low, and you can't drive the same as on regular asphalt.
During a storm, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short time.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfall, hail, condensate or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost continuously year round.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday usage means a journey to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach machines, so you can get a good look with the usual equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you can look at them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "stove exploration", "hiking safari" or "walking walk") consists of a hike that lasts from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 airline tickets and accommodation before the date of the postponement was announced, you may be faced with a difficult situation.
The rules for cancelling orders may vary, but as of late March most of the rules related to the coronavirus do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer a flat board and a flatbed, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a strap on your hand or you don't like the idea of wearing a pair of socks, you can try a fan if you have one.
Do not expose the tissue to too high a temperature (which can cause clots or in very rare cases burns).
There are different ways to treat water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it takes just a minute to boil water, in others, it takes a few minutes.
Filters are effective in many ways, and if you're in doubt, you should consider buying water from sealed bottles and from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pests they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods at certain points without taxes or excise.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The short distance between Point Marion and Fermon is the most difficult on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, often passing through isolated, deaf and forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow alleys and steep turns prevail.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than those set at previous and subsequent sites  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict compliance with them is even more important than anything else.
But oddly enough, mobile phone connectivity is much better here than at many other routes, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery is quite good, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, and it is similar to that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is common, apple baking is available year round, and cherries and plums appear in summer.
German baking often uses almonds, pudding and other nuts, and often the popular cakes are perfectly combined with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but satisfying flour confectionery, try what, depending on the region, is called olat or donuts with filling.
Curry is a herbal and spicy dish made with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of Pakistan and North India, yogurt is used extensively in curry. In South India and some regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term used to refer to the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without further specification, the term most often refers to food native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of unpretentious spices.
The arrows are the legs of the rider, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can be a safety concern, as there is a possibility of leg strangulation.
If a horse has thrown a rider but his leg is stuck in a trail, a running horse may drag him along.
First, most riders wear heels with smooth, rather thin bottom.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English ones, are equipped with protective arcs, which allow the leather strain to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is the main destination for mountaineering in Chile. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
The mountainside is spectacular, and the cliffs from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its enormous potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending on snow-covered terrain on foot-mounted skis or snowboarding.
Mountain skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski lovers (sometimes called "ski busybodies"), who plan their vacation entirely around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Mountain skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Skiing is also called backcountry, skiing or ski hiking.
This is related, but usually does not include walking up the summit and then descending unprepared slopes, as skiing requires more rigid skiing and boots.
Imagine that a ski route  is a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover a few more distances than you can on foot, but you can only achieve this speed on a ski run in the very rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and have a stretched ski.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would require visa applications and repeated passport checks.
But the Schengen area is functioning as a single country in this respect.
You can usually cross the border without going through the passport control points again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen country separately, which will save you time and money and avoid paper fuss.

And it's not cheap. You'll pay four times as much for business as you normally would in a savings class and eleven times as much for first class.
It usually doesn't even make sense to look for business class or first-class discounts for direct flights from A to B.
