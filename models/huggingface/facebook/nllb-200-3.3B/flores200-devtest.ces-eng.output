This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory that is now widely accepted) but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brown on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed ridge called the rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or displaying a feather.
Scientists believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it is a specimen of the adult animal's plumage and not the dusty plumage of a young one.
A car bomb that exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is apparently determined by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
Based on the luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of the star is determined, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic rotation.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was looking for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on Earth and causes the ebb and flow of sea level, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is around the galaxy in some sort of "square galaxy" and is made up of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered an extremely drug-resistant strain of TB (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "highly concerning, even alarming, because of its high lethality".
Dr. Moll thinks that some of the patients may have picked up the virus at the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital orderlies.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with TB still seems low; 6,000 people out of the 330,000 infected at any one time in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million doses of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare health agencies for next year.
Vaccination schedules for delivery to historically most at risk areas for this year were delayed due to lack of resources and low prioritization compared to other diseases.

All the entrances to the cave, which have been called the Seven Sisters, are at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet) in diameter.
Infrared images show how the temperature differences between day and night indicate that this is probably a cave.
 They are cooler by day than the surrounding surface and warmer by night.
Their thermal changes are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but this is consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing, of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, based in Flagstaff.
In France, voting is conducted traditionally without modern technology: Voters isolate themselves in a voting booth and insert a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope, indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will put the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a rather strict codification of the election process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and observers can prove that no envelopes were present before the start of the voting and that no envelopes other than those inserted by the counting and credentialing of voters were added.
Candidates can send their representatives to witness the entire process, and in the evening, the votes are tallied by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were evacuating the drivers from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but witness evidence could be compromised because her footage was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists may be walking on thin ice if they publish photos of even suspects.
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has indicated to the press that no further information will be provided at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will address border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics seem to be included the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the treaty, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for five years only.
The shooters were under strict supervision by the rangers during the supplemental pest control study as the studies were monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Sport Shooting Association), qualified volunteers were recruited under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's conservation division, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the measures to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by electoral setbacks, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
There have been approximately 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating, causing a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 plant-related accidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The Department of Justice responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "a regrettable fact".
The quake struck at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT) in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead at this time.
The six hostages, including children and elderly persons, were soon released, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady because she needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone is given, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators had discovered two black boxes containing flight logs in the center.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes, my first manager, Luna died on the night when there were two moons in the sky, unique as she was, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was a strong woman, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was strong, she was, she was strong, she was, she was strong, she was, she was strong, she was, she was strong, she was, she was, she was strong, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she, she was, she was, she was, she was, she, she was, she, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she was, she, she was, she was, she was, she was, she, she was, she was, she was, she was, she, she was, she was,
Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I loved her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's somewhere better.
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disapprove of Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Chief Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
As for the extreme views in the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple backflip at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his objections, his eligibility was questioned.
He was unable to take the medicine he needed to overcome the pain, as drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water supplies to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth has formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and indiscretion".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions every year.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
No emergency services will be introduced, no overground railway will be built at Wembley, no parking or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have increased the chances that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that new species have evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process takes much longer, due to breeding between endemic, intermediate, and immigrant cactus and conifer plumage.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes, and it can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and braided, it can be melted or pressed into sheets.
It can be made to a considerable thickness and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it has often been used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of the chemical, and you can make your own indicator using the juice of red cabbage.
The juice of cabbage changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry tablets together and then use your clean wet hands to make a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will result in a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in ancient Rome, they were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women used to bathe together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite to call.
A satellite in space receives the call, and then the signal bounces back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and field of view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a large rocket that measures over 100 feet.
The bicycle changed the world in ways that had never been seen before, and the most important thing it did was make transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us a train, an automobile, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cat-like prey, whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) whose diet is largely composed of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success is the ecological niches system, where each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called packs.
The flock consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to 30 females and their young.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves similar to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals strikingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can howl.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion with its throat full, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by smell, using their sense of smell to determine where they have been on the earth.
They have excellent night vision and can move very quietly. The birds hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, when they cross a mountain range or a river or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as new populations adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain their nutrients from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its day, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set set of teeth planted in the upper floor, meaning that anything that crossed its path had no chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a tongue that was open, and their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their meals would be familiar to us, the Romans did their share in strange or unusual compositions of guests, including wild boar, peacocks, sloths and a species of rodent called the plch.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their meals sitting on chairs, while rich men enjoyed feasting together, eating on their sides.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that had only been introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by means of rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of temples, special pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurates were built.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; shops were only open with counters facing the street; houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was very expensive.
The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it the Greenland.
Despite its discovery, tribes of Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were part of Scandinavia, many differences existed between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a map to the treasure.
Although the document has a written text on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence contains the words Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is evident that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
So it is likely that the entry was simply added as an appendix.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south of the country had not yet been liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a certain culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work cooperatively with each other, i.e. together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and it is related to the Latin civis, meaning civ, meaning citizen, and also civitas, meaning city or city state, and at the same time it defines the size of a society in a certain way.
The precursors of nations were city states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and adequate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the war of independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being the only component, subject to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state agencies, which often failed to cooperate, to enforce the laws.
Nor did it have any power to abolish the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states and could only be amended afterwards.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and in 2006 Italy won the World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in northern areas, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic trials.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, and the largest of them is Honshu, making Japan actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes called an "island" in a geographical sense.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing nearby recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, and begins to transform the original grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the southwestern and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main peaks: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analogue film era.
They're still made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has taken over the formats of digital camera sensors.
Although it's a bit confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
So the ratio of the sides of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) equals or comes close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed 'rule of thirds' is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in the image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired wealth and power, became the object of scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
A central Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are there for this very purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over 1,000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle had been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain was crossing international waters to keep ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited undersea military forces.
During the 1920's, pacifist and isolationist attitudes prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelty of World War I, the nations desired to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (the supervisor from his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing between different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Qin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war was fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the throne in the Great Palace of Sian.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, because instead of military ranks based on class, it's now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their own countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of secular life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on a mountain called Noor (light) and meditated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists, because it's completely isolated inside the cave.
There is nothing to see but a beautiful clear sky and a great number of surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramid-shaped structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The symbol 'upper-leaf' looks like a letter V and the symbol 'lower-leaf' looks like a square or a button with the bottom missing.
Top means you start at the tip and push the string, bottom means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the string) and pull the string.
Moving upwards usually produces a softer sound, while moving downwards is stronger and more penetrating.
You can write your own markings on the sheet with a pencil, but keep in mind that the markings printed have a musical purpose, so they should usually be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Elizabeth Philippine of France, were forced by a mob on October 6, 1789 to return from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage that surrounded the angry crowd and shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a criminal group waved the head of the royal guard at the distraught queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, with the interest on the bonds being paid in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
The extra surplus value derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, represent the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which most view ends about the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that far exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology has an influence on societies that is inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor vehicles appear, they inevitably lead to the development of roads.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, which is causing new techniques in health care to be invented to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographically formed individuals and over time, there were customs and cultures associated with that geography, and these, because they were in line with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance waned during the 12th century, especially because the Crusaders took valuables, such as silks and spices, back to Europe, and these were valued at a higher price than the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th and 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
But because of the slow communication, the Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce only the amount of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel oppressed by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be different in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some werewolf children were imprisoned for long periods of time (usually by their own parents), in some cases living in abandonment, because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, and then been abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been domesticated animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
In complete non-human animal rearing, the feral child exhibits nearly identical behaviour (within physical capabilities) to that of the caretaker, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes further.
The framework is not a learning method but rather a support tool that provides support to individuals who are embarking on new practice, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it's also a little snapshot in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates virtual constructs to analyse, motivate and explain procedures that might be too demanding for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where he or she is not properly nourished, cared for, and educated, but such instances do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster care, stable education and reliable health care.
The care of the child is to provide for all needs that have not been met in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are proposed as important motivating elements for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continued interest were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighme and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micromessages  facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
In particular, correctly interpreting micro-signs can help you determine whether someone is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, suggested how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination blend in both directions, blending differences between the two sets within each generation.
For primates with digestive systems similar to humans, it is difficult to meet the amino acid needs from plant sources that are available in the open savannah.
Failure to do so, in turn, has serious consequences: growing depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us, as for primates, to digest unless they are cooked.
By contrast, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your sleep alarm, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to sleep, as this forces you to get up and go to the toilet.
The degree of inner calmness of a man is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more good life force brings, and every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple in principle, and they are Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened by the postures of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The medium of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years, and it really did fight proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
But these plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after the soldiers invaded the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using transport to ship is by far the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but it was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and material across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this activity, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, then Germany might have conquered Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in flocks, roaming the hills or other pastures, and often guarded by herdsmen, often from among children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar sheep herders.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage roads were mostly parallel planks, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the other rough roads of the day.
The rails were introduced early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually found that the tracks were more efficient if they had a belt of iron on their surface.
This became commonplace, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, with humans starting to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor Australopithecus did not normally walk upright.
The two-legged are found in the fossil record of the Australopithecus between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce some future suffering, we can live more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic treatment, but if we want to find a temporary solution, we should seek the cause of the problem and get rid of it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of man's scientific and technological advancement, and problems have increased because of man's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten bill, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
Some 150 to 200 copies were made overnight, and these are now called "Dunlap's copies".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and one copy arrived in London on August 10.
The earliest known surviving copies of the document are the Dunlap broadsides, a collection of 25 prints from Dunlap's printer, the original manuscript of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But the birds still have a lot of dinosaur-like features.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are denoted as the binary digit  or in computer jargon bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the description for specific first aid instructions for a specific poison.
The term beetle is used in entomology for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with the maggot, an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the stinging insects and the bugs are cunning, adapting to life in the nest or home of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis reported across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can opt for a plan to adopt their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the child's parents can become another couple.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the basis for most scientific research.
But it's not experimenting in itself, an experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but it's also important for scientific research to ask questions and to observe.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms recorded in physiology and behavior often depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues its time in a free-flowing cycle even without the presence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the germ line cells were affected.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people with an interest in visiting natural areas for the purpose of admiring the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in their cars to go to work, and others pass by while they drive to work, where they have just left.
Everyone participates in this dynamic shuttle transport and supports the transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its steady state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely see such complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is there something deeper?
Operation is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly to a certain extent; therefore, the traffic usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to evade predators and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, they're the only insects that can't fold wings, dragonflies and fireflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moved around the earth.
That makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or technical precision.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the relics of their ancestors, which were at that time more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, humans have known about such basic chemicals as gold, silver, and copper, since these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they were transformed into new substances that form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget, there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that have a small amount of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a dot at the end of this sentence would fit a trillion of them.
Thus, after its invention, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil was relegated to a lowly position and secondary use.
People are typing messages on computer screens now, so they won't be able to get in touch with the clipboard.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The principle of a hydrogen bomb is that it takes energy to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a hill, and then by splitting the nucleus of an atom, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the upside and about 100 kilometers thick on the downside.
It's weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
The closer side, the more lunar seas can be found, because the crust is thinner here, so the lava could have gotten to the surface more easily.
Content theories are about finding out what people are attracted to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they take for granted during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues  peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain  one of them (or one of them).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you're transformed into a non-entity and you feel like you have to change everything the team does and do it your way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a so-called 'invisible team' (Larson  LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
If all available resources are used effectively across the functional components of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be displayed.
As a result, the process of a cooperating organisation to overcome a barrier can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
To be innovative, an organisation must have a management culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method by which organisations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of the cochlea, narrowing and refining this area of research.
Scientists in their research are promoting the relationship between brain disease and behavior.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations in science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning and intelligence adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is built into a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every course, and the teacher would often like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual sharing of excursions is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, they revise the website, but the old version stays online and serves as an album.
Blogs can also improve the writing of students, and while their blogging is often marked by sloppy spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also encourages students to have an overview of the world around them.The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs allow students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively reacting to online materials, students can define their attitudes in the context of other texts and formulate their view of a matter in specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, and to the north the beauties of Muskoka and beyond are still waiting to be discovered.
All of this and more underscores the fact that Ontario is a typical part of Canada for foreigners.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised by the following population statistic: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of wildlife, it can be considered a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to these countries, too, and the Comoros and Mayotte prospered.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The Sahel is to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers should report as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just make sure it does not look too expensive).
Women should bear in mind that because of cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment, and that it is not unusual for a man to follow a woman as she walks, to hold her hand, and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't excuse it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the town and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Badja, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of cetticas, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out given the current state of fighting that continues to take place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for the climb of Nyiragongo and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla viewing in Africa.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi).
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has its own airport.
In 1990, the desert sands were added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS Divy World Africa program hosted by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it's more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of the JAR and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there is an entrance fee and a nature conservation contribution.
Also beneficial may be the purchase of a Wild Card, which allows entry to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which many tourists consider to be their main travel destination.
The array of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is like a sparkling column graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are to be had if you leave the island and head for the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's dense urban sprawl is located on the sea-acquired territory along the northern coast.
This is the place that British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland parts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stretches of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water bodies or wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian Axis tigers can currently be found in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, we recommend that you buy your ticket several days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m], the bridge is 1,282 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 12-foot [3.5 m] wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the operation was launched in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the area we know today as eastern Paraguay, living as Polynesian hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also seen at other times of the year.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo games, look at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
While credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, you may be able to use British and American currency.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange it before you leave.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winters can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but together with the wind and humidity, the air seems colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific 'rain and dry' periods: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals in the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Despite their apparent peacefulness, buffalo, deer, moose, bear, and almost any other large animal can strike.
Every year, many visitors are injured because of the lack of proper distancing, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, bear and other wildlife attract odors, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy foods and keep your camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous naval standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with nearly 200 Americans and Germans killed.
During the independence movement organized by the Mau, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the Supreme Chairman, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, given that Auckland lies between two harbours, and the most popular beaches are found in three areas.
The North Shore (in North Harbour County) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming and most shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are off the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after Mission Bay and St. Heliers neighbourhoods of central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Drinking water from the tap is not a problem here, but if you are afraid, bottled water is usually available.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign. A small black is an espresso, a cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're top-notch.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The four-horned rhinoceros is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of Seventeen Seventy, and occasionally outside of this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The sea crocodile is not actively in the ocean, its primary refuge is the river estuary north of the town of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives travellers the assurance that they will have somewhere to stay at the destination of their trip.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but they can also be used to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport, or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp directly on site, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the middle of the action, you'll need to arrive as soon as possible to get a camping spot that's close to the music production.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival, the music may continue late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you are sailing across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as sailing through the ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
The St Petersburg cruises include time in the city.
Casinos usually try to keep their guests in as much as possible, and spend as much money as possible, but they often lack windows and clocks, and it's often difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offers to keep visitors in good spirits and on the casino grounds.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house's behalf, but drunkenness adversely affects judgment, so all good players know the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or in a mountain gorge should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as well as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or by snowfall or ice on the vehicle windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and for many tourists, it represents the highlight of the trip.
The term safari, in the familiar sense of the word, refers to a journey by land to view the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with a telescope.
A tourist safari is a hike that lasts from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in different locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 tickets and accommodation before the announcement of the delay, this situation may be difficult for you.
The rules for cancelling events may vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellations did not apply for the July 2020 Olympics.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry him out, and many hotels have irons and ironing boards for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have a comb or you do not like to wear ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause clots or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're worried, you should buy bottled water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
A troublesome insect can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, spread of venom, or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and other duties in the areas concerned.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when buying products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging for driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep corners, narrow lanes, and sharp bends are common.
The maximum speed is significantly lower than the preceding and following sections  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and its strict adherence is even more important.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service here is far better than in many parts of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, much like their southern neighbours in Austria.
Fruit is common, and apples are used all year round, followed by cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds and hazelnuts, and the popular dessert is often served with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some lavish sweets, try the desserts that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern part of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available across the archipelago, contains many simple flavored dishes, which are flavored with peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The scales on either side of the saddle serve as footrests for the rider.
They provide greater stability for riders, but may be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse, but his foot gets caught in the bridle and the horse starts running, the rider may pull behind him.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole that is relatively narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety skiing, which allows the three-beat strap to fall off the saddle when the rider pulls behind it.

As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which saves you time, money and paperwork.

Back currents are returning waves that crash on the beach, often at the site of a cliff or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, and that's where the fast current into deep water can form.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head for a place where you won't be struck again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, wait for help.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (there is a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer and can be more severe.
