Republican strategy to resist Obama 's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that election fraud is rarer than death by lightning in the United States.
And Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the American system of democracy.
Unlike Canada, the states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
That's why most state governments since 2009 have passed laws that make it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed that restricted voting rights in 41 states.
New election laws require that voters present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce early voting, abolish the right to register to vote on election day, and deprive citizens with a criminal record of the right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no state in the United States required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an Indiana law in 2008.
Republican officials quickly expanded the practice to other states.
In the last two years, they've initiated bills requiring voters to show photo ID in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity document such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
And five million new voters in 2012 don't have one.
The cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 percent of African-Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 percent of people over the age of 65, and 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Student voters, who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates, are not permitted in several states to use photo IDs issued by their school.
But those same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly Republican, to use the voting cards issued by those clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
Arizona is the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the voting of Latinos.
Two-thirds of Latino voters are believed to vote for the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated legislation in 2011 abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
They also restricted the ability of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction was not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 elections, a voter registration campaign helped to register some 10 million citizens.
Meanwhile, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early voters were African American, although the latter made up only 13% of the state's total voters.
The same thing happened with the Latin Americans.
Representing only 11% of the electorate, they made up 24% of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, only 46% of those who voted early voted.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been active in opposing the passage of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended by the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This has helped to limit the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have laws requiring photo ID.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing them as clearly aimed at influencing the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are in part discrediting the American system of democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: Should I take it or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives false negatives, sometimes false positives, which leads to useless medical intervention.
Men, who are reluctant to go to the hospital, have even more to worry about.
To take the test or not?
We asked two experts.
Studies in the United States have seen many cases of infection in the study groups, so the data is difficult to interpret and to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found different mortality rates in those who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the chances of metastasis were 30 to 40 percent higher in those who had not been screened.
So I would recommend getting tested at age 50, or at age 40 if you have a close relative who's had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is found.
Cancers can be either aggressive or slow-moving.
You need to explain to the patient the risk of his cancer, offering him options, not necessarily treating prostate cancer that is not life threatening in the long term, but choosing, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not seek treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
We are increasingly defining criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend that you take the test.
But it's also important to talk to your doctor about whether or not you should have this test.
In collaboration with the International Urological Association, Movember has developed a tool that can evaluate the pros and cons of a PSA test.
This document (which is not yet available in English, but will be translated shortly) can be downloaded from: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic formula to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce your risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate a healthy diet and got enough exercise, 30% of all cancers could be prevented.
"If more people stopped smoking, that number would have increased to at least 50 percent", says André Boullier, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers are hereditary.
A few cancers remain completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Association continues to make smoking a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 percent of lung cancers.
And it's a risk factor for many others.
It's doing tremendous damage to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", says spokesman André Bolier.
The encouraging fact is that after 10 years of quitting, your risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the development of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life is protective against colon cancer", adds the Association.
Power supply
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too high a dose, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by cooking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage cells and cause cancer", explains the association.
The vitamins .
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But at this point, the results of these studies are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies have produced conflicting results.
If one showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other showed the opposite.
The impact of vitamin D on cancer is also not fully understood.
However, Mr. Bole stresses that it is important to discuss your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Giving in to the test does not lead to cancer".
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, the news that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused quite a stir - and for good reason.
This boson is thought to account for the mass of all particles in the universe, no matter how much or how little.
It is also the last particle predicted to exist in the Standard Model - our best, or at least least least "least perfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has never been detected experimentally before.
But physicists are not yet sure that this is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
And new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to support that, although some data is not yet available to be sure.
But let's say we're talking about the Higgs boson, because the chances of being wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is absolutely inescapable, which is that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, don't even try too hard, or you will hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it too has one law of a similar nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which posits that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment in time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" is, in general, some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, there are the bosons, a vile gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the highly unusual Particle Adventure site at Berkeley Lab, these bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't discuss here, and "force particles", which are the main forces of nature, and which the Higgs boson is a part of.
These bosons themselves, it should be emphasized, are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you're able to read this history, it's because of one incredibly mundane boson: the photon, or "light particle", which is the courier of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it disrupts the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "breach" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "force carriers" bosons.
A more stable field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, except that in order for this boson to be created, another field, the Higgs field, must be violated.
But the Higgs boson is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to get it excited, you have to reach very, very high energies, as if you were talking about a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large rock.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one that's operating at CERN -- the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring that's 27 kilometers across! -- to achieve these enormous energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some of them, like magnets, interact, and some of them don't interact, like a piece of paper, which will never stick to the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do interact have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) don't.
So, what does all this research "can bring", asks Mrs. Plaumondon?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to detect discrepancies between observational results and SM predictions.
And some of them are eager to see that discrepancy uncovered, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to new physics and close some of the holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe (oh-oh!).
But so far, no such discrepancy has been found at CERN.
The Consequences
It's harder to predict how this research will benefit the average person's daily life, but it would be a mistake to assume it doesn't.
Look: back in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not have even imagined the revolution their work would bring.
They envisioned their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that originally the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gadget".
I mean, imagine that.
And also, an app can be found for the toolkit that accompanies the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, is now the eye of all digital cameras in the world and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Now, this doesn't mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it does show that anything is possible.
Palliative care is the best way to die...
The Quebec Commission for a Decent Death recently discussed the sensitive issue of end-of-life.
The debate is due to resume shortly, and a bill is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this vital area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Montereggio.
Prostate cancer, which had been destroying him from the inside, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven", he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the Victor-Gadboua palliative care shelter in Belloy, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, and you can't prepare for it", he says.
The disease does its job: incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom or even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a delicious meal, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He's alive, even manages to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage in the face of a common death.
"My greatest desire is to be cured of diarrhea, which is humiliating", he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
"Throughout life, we are taught that a man should urinate standing up", says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois shelter.
To regress to the status of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"It's all about the ability of people" to accept decline, he says.
Because, according to many people in palliative care, the most important events happen in the midst of this decline.
The patients who come to Victor Gadbois' hospice are all cancer patients.
The prognosis is three months to live, tops.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing what is called "therapeutic" care.
Mrs. A., 89, has the greatest fear of dying "in consciousness from suffocation".
But the illness has allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I don't want anything more in my life", she says before being given permission to put on a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for the last visit of her son, who has arrived from Italy.
The Victor Gadbois shelter provides care and nutrition assistance through a group of volunteers.
It's the palliative care that's left over when there's nothing more to do.
To make dying more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one place in a palliative care facility for every 11,700 residents.
It's not much, considering we're all gonna die sooner or later.
Life here continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the hospice's doctors.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
We will agree to give the dying person mouth rinses of brandy or Pepsi, depending on what he asks for.
We don't make diabetics control their blood sugar anymore.
And death is a part of everyday life.
We brought beer last night to Mr. X, who died tonight.
His son drank that beer in the dead man's legs this morning.
"We are helping the families as well as the patients", says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
At Victor Gadbois, no day is the same.
Alongside a 93-year-old man enjoying his last encounter with his family in the backyard, reclining on his pillows while a toast is made to him, tragically dies a young man of 36 surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and who has tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45", says Dr. Christian Martel with concern.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadboa's shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is the care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stages of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbois Home and the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this gap in Quebec's health care system that is making many palliative care practitioners fearful of a bill that would legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by the luminaries of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapuant, expressing their disapproval of such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not efficient enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia is allowed.
She says, "I recently saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in excruciating pain, and no one took the necessary steps to help her.
I'm afraid that patients are willing to die because they don't get the proper care.
At the same time, many cancer doctors are still trying to save their patients, despite the pessimistic prognosis.
Helen Richards's chances of survival were already slim when she stopped the grueling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was stopping the fight", she says.
She told me that my days were numbered!
There is no cure-all.
Dr. Martell believes that 90 percent of patients who ask for death thank the nursing staff for not granting their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not an absolute panacea for pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of death, either occasionally or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we are unaware of this suffering.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients in pain always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized", it means "I want to feel better".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials in charge of road construction, construction contractors, party fundraisers, and Italian mafia experts tell day after day what they know about the colossal "system" that surrounds the construction industry, government employees, politicians, union officials, and mafiosi.
"Industry", which has come at a great cost to Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how this system falls apart after all the resources have been put into the case", jokes Jacques Duchesne, a deputy and former chief of police in Montreal.
It was he who caused the 2011 scandal, as a by-product of the investigation of official misconduct related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Chare, reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchene Report established a direct link between industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", he points out, if some had restrained their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already removed two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "uncover the schemes behind the individuals".
Permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which was created in 2011 and includes a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Hammer", who after 2009 forced the "sweep cartel" of Montreal to stop overestimating the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Risharu Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next up is Gilles Vaillant, recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly taking bribes in the placement of state orders.
In addition, formal charges were brought against several Montreal railway engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter set off a real bombshell by telling the investigation about a "system" for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito had been giving 3% of the value of contracts made in Montreal to a certain intermediary connected with the mafia, who, in turn, had been transferring money to Mayor Gerald Trumbull's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito was a money-spinner, having transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly to the Liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to illegally collecting funds for former Liberal Party deputy prime minister Natali Normando.
Sewerage contracts that overstate the value
In Montreal, the system of corruption was working.
Gilles Surprén, a former civil engineer, described it in detail to the commission: in ten years, he had received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the value of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they were paid handsomely, overpaying bills by 30-40% with fake additions.
Then one mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trumbull of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that was filling the party coffers with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairi district in the east of the island, she has been opposing since 2010 the sale of a municipal site bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a building boom.
70% of the dirty money in the election campaign .
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will "pull the strings to understand the functioning of the ant-infestation system, to stop gangrene and identify the culprits".
She characterizes this process as "painful but positive".
We're in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid a return of questionable practices.
How we clean the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesne notes that "the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" but did not participate in the scheme.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the electoral campaign in Quebec is as high as 70%, he jokes, "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but, he says, that won't change the situation: "Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics".
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of awarding government contracts and funding parties: "We cannot go lower; by going boldly into the heart of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality".
If this story is casting a shadow over the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesne calls on those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You've made a great leap this season at PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
It could be explained by individual consciousness, but it could also be explained by a new dimension of the P.S.I.
The big players are here.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors are driving me to improve my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
Everything in football happens very fast.
But I'm not going to get excited.
From my early days at the NIF Pre-Training Centre in Clairfontaine to my arrival at Saint-Étienne, I was always a forward-thinking person.
So you're taking advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
It's not unusual for this summer's reserves to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is important.
It's what makes a player like me so eager to be on the level and play to the max.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti is helping me with my positioning.
He's helped by substitutes like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the boss?
I'm sure you are.
Angelotti has a great respect for all the technicians.
Today, he is the best manager in the Premier League and one of the best in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had a very encouraging conversation with him in January.
I was coming off a series of injuries.
The trust he has in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season at PSG?
In the Premier League, Lyon took away our leader.
But we're still on the alert.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the last eight in a spectacular way.
What is the club's goal in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
We'll be able to speak face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, so we can take a return match in the last one.
Can PSG become a top-flight European club in the short term?
He's got the budget for it...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure a position for the long term.
Today is not.
The PSG has the financial means to make this project a reality.
Not winning the Premier League title like last season is a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win the championship.
We came this close last season.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Normally, 79 points means the championship.
But the other team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that the title is contested by such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expects too much from the PSG?
It's normal that we're expected to do a lot, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We're fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troy and we're still criticized for it, of course, it's a little upsetting.
We ask ourselves, what is the first thing people want from us?
We'll never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game design.
A team is built over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can meet the challenges of our time.
Look at Manchester United, who have not made it to the last eight for two seasons, even though they have spent a lot of money!
With the money we've invested, we thought you'd be 15 points ahead by the winter break.
It would be a disrespect to our opponents and to the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at their best last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
It just goes to show how exciting the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we won the result.
PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say there's a "gold addiction" thing going on?
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's come for it and he's proving he's a major league star.
Wherever he's played, he's shown he's a great player and a world-class star.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly extraordinary.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's such a disappointment.
I really wanted to be in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting some playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
I 'm playing good qualifiers today .
It's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blue.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first few months as the Blue's captain?
They're productive for him.
He's got a good position in the World Cup qualifying group.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and he inspires them to win.
What Laurent Blanc was like.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he has qualified us for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1), pulled on October 16 in Spain - is this the fundamental match?
This game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for all.
Before the shock in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of current monetary exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties and the commission fees for processing them.
And then, as is so often the case with these technologies, there is obviously a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros ...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been logged from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.
Bitcoin peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, then dropped to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency published in October, took an interest in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as "credits" used to promote a video game, which are earned in the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange is always controlled and processed by some central organ.
In Bitcoin, all nodes are simultaneously book-keepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information pertaining to this transaction is signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Because of the contents of the file, it's possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this ledger.
It goes through a mathematical problem sent to the computer, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
It's the phase of hashing a file, which is converting a large file into a digital signature that's short and unique.
The computers take the new transaction and add a number to it before hashing it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it's correct.
The transaction thus becomes indissolubly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of fraud, a user would very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wish to pay twice for the same money, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred million, which still leaves a reserve...
The complexity of the problem also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the web has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and Bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect in use is not the protocol itself", says Pierre Nouaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, allow it.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
The "giant sale" was announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars has been exchanged", says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a company that converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nouaise, another currency expert, strongly believes in the technology's potential as an operational network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Nouaz, assuring that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to re-evaluate hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB's report also suggests that the system's success should be accompanied by a review of the various risks that are now considered to be increased.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are supposed to follow suit in late 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take back control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not relying on us.
We have mostly targeted Afghan peasants, who we considered terrorists.
And here we are, with 88 soldiers dead, and wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They're tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, but they'll be gone once the West starts to be more sensitive.
The French troops were withdrawing from the base in the Negev, which I had observed from the hills of almond trees, thanks to French loans, in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, escorted by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attacks in Kabul by the end of 2014 .
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable rise from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Their taking control of the country was seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the darkness of these peasants, which Al Qaeda has overtaken, but their situation has not improved in the present day.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subservient position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They've turned into dealers, seizing state land to resell it for development to repatriates from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US subcontracting contracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, never even fought in the war themselves.
The people, I hear, in the countryside want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from the American generosity: the capital outflow is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
We must provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world and are watched everywhere.
Right now, there is an army.
Will the powers that be beholden to it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who were fighting the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking steps to restore the provincial troops, which would not be subject to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be to some extent decentralized, following the example of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even before, has been dependent on foreign aid.
No industry was put on its feet, no dam was functioning, no irrigation system was repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by thirty years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had vast mineral wealth.
It only reinforced the feeling that the Western powers were there only to take over.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site, without the means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already abandoned the Mes Ainak copper deposit, leaving the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, should also restore normal relations.
The French withdrawal of combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lycée for girls, for boys, the faculty of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "civil-military activity" service under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has promoted numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase in arable land.
What will we be remembered for, after spending two billion euros on military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, who live in these harsh valleys, often at altitudes of over 2,000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers want, as they told me, they need a little non-military support that is well-controlled and goes directly to them.
The heavy birth of Egypt's Constitution
This is another risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
With Egypt more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he has decided to play it safe.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has relied on a draft text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only further divided the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "violet the given word" and "trample the law".
In the camp of his followers, this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that makes the Brothers abandon their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
It's also a way for the president to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor, as he stated in an interview with the American magazine Time.
Moreover, the call for an early vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I reserve extraordinary powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to make a statement.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To reach the necessary quorum, 11 people, reserve participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, most of the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators were amused, by the way, by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day was around... the time for prayer, as some committee members felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were set incorrectly.
The text, which was still on the ballot yesterday, contains 234 articles.
The subject of much public attention, Article 2 ultimately remained the identical article from the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their more rigorous application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", say the liberals, who see it as a PR stunt.
Because they think the Islamization of the Constitution is happening through other articles.
They pointed in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly in checking the compliance of laws with the Sharia.
This is alarming, according to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, because "the people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can see the emergence of a theocracy".
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next president of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious interference at this time.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university-educated people, some trained in the French system", says Alexis Bloy, who is writing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "confusion may arise around Article 220, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This is particularly true of "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, - ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to rule on this".
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they are much smaller than they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention is the authority of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the defence budget will be considered not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will it prohibit the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the pleas of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered to be detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy is preserved, and from now on, insult is forbidden, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles speak about protecting women anymore, points out Heba Moraef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive, she says, is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Navel of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern conveniences, and the pristine nature of the land.
The AIF has identified the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let 's worship the sacred places .
He is standing by the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters the dome is granted divine favor.
Galilee is the site of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on water, calming a storm, and filling the nets.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But most holy is Jerusalem.
Here, the faithful follow the Way of Sorrows or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia, the Praetorium, where the court was, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on the Mount of Golgotha, the place of the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone and the burial place of Jesus.
It is also the site of the Christian symbol, the Navel of the Earth, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which Jesus' cross was made grew.
Jerusalem also has the Jewish holiest site, the Western Wall, a remnant of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
It is a tradition for people of all faiths to leave wishes here, which are then fulfilled.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the fortress of Massada are what remains of the secret refuge from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on the slopes of the mountains at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level.
And only those who love mountaineering can reach them on their own.
The rest of us are being transported to this historic peak by a cable car.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 meters, is the famous ski resort of Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
There's a shuttle bus from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski trails is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountain's summit.
Visiting the Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't get to all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the oldest known Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is worth a visit.
The exhibition is widely represented by the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renouard, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which is a series of old Turkish bath houses with the mock-ups of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, the unique private Raleigh Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire Dali and Rodin's sculptures.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells one of the most dramatic stories in history.
The most tragic section - the children's memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who perished in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in, and you're in total darkness.
The stars are twinkling.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are being read.
Ukraine is mentioned there, too.
Get well .
Israel's three main resort areas are located on the Mediterranean, Red, and Dead Seas.
Each has a swimming pool, water park, dolphinarium, and oceanarium.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is a popular swimming spot even in the winter months, as the water temperature never drops below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21°C) and the air warms to 80 degrees (23°C).
The Dead Sea is warmer, and bathing is done year-round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is located at the lowest point on the planet - 417 meters below sea level.
Its turquoise water is brine that easily keeps even the most unskilled of swimmers afloat.
The scenery is so beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with salt water, rapeseed, and curative mud, and to heal the health of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring back the nerves that have been shaken.
To touch the secrets of the ancient
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv - the Mediterranean town of Jaffa.
It was the site of the famous Sea Route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, fortune will be kind.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can visit the Roman theater and "take" the Crusader fortress.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A tourist to note
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population knows Russian.
It is better to take money for travel in dollars rather than in euros, which are easily exchanged for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
City transport is mostly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa, the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
It's basically an underground funicular.
The fare for all forms of public transport is 6 shekels, which can be used for a ride of 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish Sabbath is observed on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transportation are closed.
And then Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels serve only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales, and dishes that combine milk with meat.
There is a wide variety of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, hammered nut balls - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are plenty of fat cats who are very good at walking around on their own.
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The marmots love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Depending on the brand, renting a car can cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance, $15 a day.
And a bicycle rental will cost 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In the language of numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The most popular destinations for travel and leisure were the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than the same indicator in 2010, until the visa was canceled on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will bring to Moscow: migrants are hoarding money on the tongue
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the mandatory language test law will bring, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million tourists come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support their families back home.
On December 1, a law came into force that requires every migrant worker to take a Russian language test.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, the housing and communal services sector, the household sector and retail trade.
However, the FMS promises that in time, testing will be mandatory for all visitors.
Besides, you'll have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history, and the basics of legislation.
You will need to prove your knowledge of the language both for obtaining and for extending your work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law does not apply to those who have received certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, Punishment and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, SPbSU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights activists had asked the press many times: what will it actually give?
What will the mandatory knowledge of the language change for both Russians and foreigners themselves?
First of all, says the immigration officials, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian FMS representative office in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise from migrants who have no profession, no education, no language, no medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will force him into a creepy, cramped barrack where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, toiling for 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In their homeland, they are promised one thing, but when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken, and their promised salary is not paid", confirms the head of the Main Department of Labour Migration of the Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear, you squatter!
However, many Central Asian citizens who are going to Russia to earn money admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they are seeking, but also have difficulty writing in their own.
Of course, it's not so much their fault as it is the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajikis can afford to get even a basic education in interpreting.
Their families have nothing to feed their children, much less to dress them properly, to dress them properly, and to equip them for school.
By the time they reach adolescence, they are ready to go to work at any opportunity.
It's hard if you're not fluent in the language, they admit.
"Feeling humiliated and inferior".
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
The testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If you don't have a status, you won't get an exam, and you won't get a job.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or no strangers allowed"
Many of the newcomers claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is the same bureaucratic hurdles and language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only $1,500.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", - said a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Khushkadamov.
"Fly in, don't skimp, buy the painting"
On the first day of the language law's entry into force, it was discovered that not only immigrant registration documents were fake.
Several fake language test certificates have already been seized by the FMS.
The forged paper is printed on a standard color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for nothing: each of the migrants, who hoped to ease the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That's more than twice the cost of the official testing procedure: it costs a migrant worker 3,000.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that "shorts" cannot simply be bought, authorities and human rights activists agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who failed to pass the test successfully the first time, time to study a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs in areas that do not involve active interaction with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs will not take up the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is proposing tougher laws against civilian gun owners.
This is the authorities' reaction to recent incidents: the shooting at weddings, when no one was killed, and the massacre, arranged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, in which seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the wearing of body armor in public and raise the age at which you can get a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Countering Corruption, Irina Yarupova, and promised that amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the Russian authorities' attempt to fight the problem by "twisting the nuts".
An open letter has appeared online, in which the authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand to abandon "senseless hardening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC, the lawyer-criminologist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 firearms offences were registered in the internal affairs bodies in the first six months of 2012, while 1,168,000 crimes were registered in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not prevent the criminal from going to the "black" market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, you can get any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior claims to be monitoring the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: From factories to officers
The black market is being filled by several channels.
Five are the main channels, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site accepting orders for weapons
The first is "army or military trace", that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were drawn by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves", says Baranec.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from members of the security forces.
Baranetz explains that this includes both stolen goods from police stores and stolen goods from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "stoves" are being sold from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses have been subject to frequent explosions.
"There are well-documented versions that some of the fires were set on purpose - to cover up the shortfall", says the former military man.
According to Barantz, the weapons industry is making its contribution.
"Now there are private weapons factories that cannot compete in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow", the expert says.
Another source of black market money is smuggling.
The main source of guns and machine guns comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production, sometimes a craftsman, and a mafia formed, which organized the flow", the former military explains.
Where'd you get the gun?
Experts have calculated what the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market is.
A report on this was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Management Design in 2011.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all black-market weapons were "caused by officials whose jobs are related to weapons", says the report.
Researchers found that 17% of the weapons came from armed conflict, 14% of the weapons were stolen during production, and 5% were "black archaeology".
A sales consultant for a gun shop, who asked not to be named, said that the weapons found by the black diggers have been out of stock for a long time - too old.
He says that the most common way that salespeople get new shipments is to go to a military warehouse.
Through a P.O.A., a person purchases a unit, such as a TT pistol.
They write it out, they pass it through the screen.
"He takes it to the city and sells it here for 900 euros a piece with two shops", he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when the crime plan is burning, they conduct a control purchase from the illegal arms dealers", the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at websites, blogs, until a comrade answered, who suggested coming to the platform "Begovaia", where there would be a person who would take me to the "corner", where we would trade.
I only knew the price of the gun there.
Military columnist Victor Baranec
"I need a friend who has a way out", says the sales consultant. "I have a friend who has a way out, but I'm not sure about him".
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell you that his daughter's tooth fell out".
I'm even getting a couple of cassettes through a guy I'm sure of.
He only delivers to me, too, because he knows I won't give him up.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The patterns, he said, hadn't changed.
He was given a photo album with "anything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Lamb, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client, so I don't just buy, we take the salesman into the woods, we set up a target.
"I get a chance to shoot, and when I'm sure the gun is good, we start trading", the expert describes the procedure.
The shop on the couch.
Internet search engines direct users to Vkontakte sites and groups that offer to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No paperwork or face-to-face meetings are required.
"All you need is a certain amount of money", says a banner on the website Buying a Fighting Gun or Machine Gun.
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
What about minors?
"Without a license of course", asks an "Ivan" user (spelling is correct).
"The cup of the TT.Moscow" - laconically formulates the request of the Fedorenkov.
The FSB has now spread a vast web of fake websites and people wanting to buy weapons with a shovel.
People come like hungry fish to the feeding station, then they go to Siberia to mine coal.
Military commentator and former military man Victor Baranec
I've heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The customer pays at the ATM.
"They send back a photograph and instructions on where the weapons are hidden", says Dmytro Kislov, a spokesman for the right-to-weapon organization.
Viktor Baranec claims that leaving a request on the site can leave you unarmed and put you in jail.
The FSB has now dispersed a vast network of fake websites and people who want to buy weapons are shoveling.
"People are coming like hungry fish for fodder, and then they are mining for coal in Siberia", he says.
The 100 bucks worth of macarons
Experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be saved by buying illegal firearms.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Weapons organization, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100 to $300.
It'll take a month or a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage by the management of these mid-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the department, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has swept across America at Walmart department stores and popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or whether it will be extinguished in the early stages.
The action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to the modest salaries that ordinary Walmart and fast food workers receive, the protestors' goal is to create unions in them.
So far, this sector of the economy has barely been covered by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on what is known as Black Friday, when America was hit by a frenzy of cheap sales that captured the imagination of millions of shoppers and sometimes led to a brawl.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, walked off their jobs and picketed the company's stores, which cater to the lower and middle-income groups, along with trade unions and left-wing activists.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers and hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners and eggs and milk.
Its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than the big supermarkets.
So many low-paid Walmart employees are stuck in their jobs.
The affordability and variety of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods cheaper partly because it pays its workers less.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, for example, a lack of forklift trucks or hand-held scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee, making $9.50 an hour, they said, that's out of their pocket.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley have argued that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she spends on her current salary.
If Walmart were to pass on the entire pay rise to the shoulders of its customers, each visit to the store would cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they'll spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters point out that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
Black Friday ran in its stores from 8pm on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart was selling about 5,000 items a second.
In total, its cash registers processed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a representative of the corporation, claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left the workplace, and that the protest was merely "an ordinary publicity stunt" by the union that organized it.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the target was not Walmart (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you sick leave or pay you for honest work!
Jumeine Williams, member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York state law, is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but not much, and the average New York City employee is paid $8.90 an hour.
That's the lowest anyone can earn in this expensive city.
How you can exist in New York with that kind of money is beyond me.
At one time, McDonald's was a place where a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school, living with their parents.
Few people saw it as a major source of livelihood or planned to stay there for long.
Now I'm constantly interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live off that salary and sometimes even feed their kids on it.
On the other hand, there's a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum where the author says it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're feeding them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of the fast food system be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that there be a union in the fast-food industry.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing union activists with dismissal and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But getting fast food unionism is hard for objective reasons, too.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary fluidity of the frame.
Disagree
Noisy protests took place on this day at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The action culminated in a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, including city council member Jumeine Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you sick leave and doesn't pay you for honest work!"
The protesters were joined by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said "we must come together to support fast food workers to achieve the fair pay and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
The New York Times described it as the largest such action in the history of the American fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were employees of the fast-food chain that employs tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It's not clear if this spark will ignite a mass movement.
"So far, cheating the brain is average".
The popular augmented reality theme among modern technology enthusiasts has been viewed through the lens of special glasses.
First, Google showed the current model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for a corresponding patent.
But speaking to Sharam Izadi, the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge Lab, the company's scientists say that the glasses are a thing of the past.
They're fascinated by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell us, in general, what your research group does?
- We're doing a human-machine interaction, but we're trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in the phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking at them with a finger.
We want to look five to 10 years ahead and see how this interaction is going to change.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without the Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is ahead?
- Even though Kinect has taken interaction to a physical level, a lot of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system gets more data), but the output is not very good.
And what we're trying to change is we're working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems that are based on a variety of technologies, including projective.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
But to do that, you have to understand not only the user, but also the space around them.
Then we can add virtual objects to the real world in a much more convenient form.
And to hell with the stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice control?
It's a popular item, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - it's a privacy issue, because you don't always want to let people know what you're doing or what you're planning.
Actually, all kinds of computer interactions are good, but each one is in a different niche.
For example, for controlling devices in public spaces, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not the big ones, but the small ones, the small ones.
The gestures were recorded not by the device's camera, but by a wrist bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
It's big, but theoretically, it could be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But the future is mixed control, like gesture plus voice.
- What's that?
- Like how you're asking me to hand you this can of soda?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual bond.
I think in the near future, we're going to have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that allow us to more accurately measure human responses.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good depth resolution, that's very important.
Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your complaint with the modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth or something?
- Basically, the current generation is what we can use as a starting point for our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to have an 8-megapixel camera with 1000fps.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
In the final analysis, all the current technologies are not good enough for us -- it's adding work to the algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not just the X and Y, but the Z.
And also very important is the speed, the frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 knots is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bethices of our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with a controllable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern mass-produced sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
I could really use an equivalent in my work, but it doesn't require touch, so it's a lot more frames per second.
- Do we need to increase the cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a reflected signal receiver.
And now the third camera is actually a regular visible-band sensor.
It's not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of computation required.
It would be nice to build a flexible Kinect analog, play with the curvature of the camera layout and see how it helps in 3D positioning.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, has never publicly presented its glasses.
Don't you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with your smartphone in your hand all the time is not very comfortable, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "transitional" augmented reality, where you could switch from glasses to smartphone, projection display and so on, based on a cloud platform.
The glasses are very personal devices, and that's their strength -- private things only you can see -- and their weakness at the same time -- augmented reality based on the glasses won't let you work on virtual objects with other people.
- Let's assume for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but to a mere mortal.
There's one problem that critics often point to: there's no tactile feedback!
My hands are numb!
What responses is your team preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensation.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of a substrate for the image.
She's got a great sense of touch!
But there are technologies that are really meant to give these "pictures in the air" a sense of touch -- like the interference of a few directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is, giving a sensation, but so far very faint -- like you're being blown on a pillow.
And then there are wrist bracelets that affect nerve endings in the fingers -- another promising area.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Make him think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There's another challenge that we're going to be struggling with for a long time -- how do you make a person who is physically in a very confined space believe that they're walking in an open, virtually infinite space -- and we're working on the concepts of running tracks (not club tracks), moving platforms, and also huge balloons.
While the brain is being cheated on average, the work is still years away.
And that's what makes virtual reality work so compelling for researchers -- a lot of stuff is in its infancy.
The taste of the culture - Rosbaltru.
Rosbalt continues the project "Peterburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-list already includes bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosebalt" is the epitome artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, who is found here at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable parties and vernissages.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social-philosophical fairy-tale writers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
He's also a city man, a man who makes people smile by appearing on the streets, who lifts the spirits of the people.
He has recently taken up the role of St. Petersburg's charm-artist, as he is ripe for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you go around in red instead of yellow or turquoise?
I chose red as a fashion designer, as a designer of looks and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and society.
Although in society, anything that is not slightly gray causes aggression and excitement of the negative property.
But my provocations are meant to start a conversation.
My whole history of provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you know you wanted to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the Nevskiy Museum, where my work was exhibited.
I realized this was my path.
Then the wave of the old free, informal artists passed, and the new, free types of me were unintelligible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, the post-Gazan movement that led to the "Pushkin-10", and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, all kinds of things except words.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkin-10, and there, until there was a repair, there was a musical-artistic club, bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemian.
A lot of people were born there, but we, Tequila Jazz, remember bringing in the Strings with the Van Gogh Ear project.
The string and his friends sang light songs under the faner, they were in a wrap-around trico, among them was the fashionable now composer Igor Vdowin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the times of the Khali-Ghali.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he had a great career, and he had his basic education and upbringing with us.
D137 Gallery, the "Gribble Club" is an echo from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I'm a hero of a century ago, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city".
I was named Artist of the Year, and that was the end of my culmination.
In new times, by old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In this age, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, with a strong sense of urgency and acuity.
I'm having a program exhibit, "Russian museum in clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, but now it's painful and scary.
But clowns are all about the drama, the tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have some grotesque ideas.
Like saving the world by a totalitarian makeover in an orderly fashion.
Now, the way people meet is by their clothes, by their outward mechanics, not by their inner man.
Maybe you shouldn't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by a disguise.
- The cultural city should have a hero like that.
Who else but me could be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art now has to be neat, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people used to get together in a pack. Bohemians liked one thing, but not the other.
Now that everyone's in a micro-community, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to be liked.
You have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov is worth several thousand!
- It's where the brownies come in, where the sex-social sphere kicks in.
And on the cultural level, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't, and you end up with less management, less money, and everything goes down the tubes.
I have fans, and the important thing is not to cheat them, not to ruin the profits.
I painted such pictures when I was young that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually end with.
There's a lot of confusion about that these days.
They say that culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, raised on the examples of artists who lived and died in poverty, who gave up money to paint paint.
I'm all for that culture.
- Kirill, what is it that St. Petersburg lacks?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a term for this: a cultural official.
But not all of them can practice culture.
It wasn't like that with the right kings, the kings, they may not have been very knowledgeable in culture, but they knew that you had to have the right experts.
Moscow has good consultants now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're being pushed back because we need higher experts to properly evaluate these experts and give them a pass.
Now the taste buds are thriving.
Same Errata, but they're different because they honestly say that not all contemporary art is accepted, there are artists who have to find other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg to you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is soil.
And it's hard for art to grow on our rocks.
We need a cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers now, and that's wrong.
There are many curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of toner.
We need to make art fashionable, like it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the grant of St. Petersburg
To be born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with Earthlings on board are being sent out to search for a backup planet.
To save humanity, the big question is how to continue our species in zero gravity or on the same spare planet?
I think it's a small choice.
There are only two real planets that can be explored, hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars", - said Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg (GASI).
But if Mars is more conducive to life, Venus' surface is 500 degrees.
Life can only be lived at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The first approach to space reproduction was the flora.
They've been experimenting on plants for half a century.
The four generations of the orbiting pea were no different from their Earth counterparts.
Then, the orbiting of the insects, the tiny fruit flies, the drozophiles.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo would develop in zero-gravity.
We're getting a perfectly normal chick on the way out.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem is that this chick has to find a support, it has to stand on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find a place to stand, the chicks were left to roar.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of their instincts.
The chicks didn't respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they were dead within four days.
"We hatched chicks twice, but then we gave up because it was impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev, who has failed to carry chicks into space.
The last time a biological mini-traveler flew an animal into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, the Bion will only be carrying a single-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with a fetus.
Basically, there's nothing supernatural there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment, and such research should be conducted", - Vladimir Sychev notes.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But we're not really going to be able to do this in space.
It's not easy.
Animals, when they lose their natural habitat, can't use their sexual instincts.
A human being, unlike a beast, can.
Homo sapiens have an abstract mind, and are able to create the appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been going to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive its flight into space.
If she can bear a child after this flight.
"This is a question that nobody has answered", says veteran rocket scientist Vakhtang Vakhnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after her first spaceflight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitsky, who twice visited orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
But the risk remains.
We're a small, single group of astronauts who have made it through long flights, and we're growing a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights", - sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, creating artificial gravity.
The CPC hydrology lab is a mandatory flight training phase.
Here, in zero buoyancy, astronauts are honing their skills in outer space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If water, though comfortable, is a foreign environment to adults, it is a natural environment to infants.
The tiny ichthyanders seem to confirm that life emerged from the ocean.
There's a connection between the baby being in the mother's amniotic fluid for about nine months, and then getting used to the water.
It makes sense, because from the time you were born, from the time you took that first bath, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something", says the instructor of cradle swimming, Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for a child to be born, gravity is necessary for a woman.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvis, the ability to push the fetus out, all shrink.
All right, let's lower that, too, relying on the birth stimulants.
You can go to the delivery room, it'll push him out.
"What's next?" is a question that is not trivial.
On the other hand, the baby needs artificial gravity, too.
Without the gravity, the body cannot form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special training loading suit.
He will simply be deprived of what he will need to survive.
"And this experiment, which we will go with you, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely unadapted person", - foresees the head of the bioethics committee of the RASB IMBP Igor Pestov.
So far, having babies in space is a matter of theory.
But in time, it will be a reality, when Earthlings in their ships will travel to a distant planet, which will be home to their spaced-out offspring.
The control of the schwarz system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kal, vice president of the Supreme Control and Audit Office, in an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which I think we lack", said Kala, commenting on the current situation.
Such conclusions are drawn by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of a wrong practice, Peter Nechas's approach to the so-called schwarz system is cited.
Recently the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother the entrepreneurs with inspections - is this prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, the prime minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions that are charged with the duty to check and enforce obligations", says Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
I mean, parallel testing, which we started, like, two years ago.
In short, it is about European legislation determining how public procurement should be carried out, followed by national legislation and then also the practical application.
All the information was collected and, even with the verification still incomplete, interesting differences were discovered - to put it simply, our legislation may be "accurate and infallible", but in practice we are inferior to Germany in some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, we must focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the refinement of laws, the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it's not a fact that we're going to achieve that by lowering the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be overwhelmed with paperwork so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much more easily than if the restriction were not lowered.
You're talking about internal problems with the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the system of control work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU (control and revision office) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is structured on our principle, as our central authority, and there is also a board, which works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in a similar way.
And also, the powers are somewhat similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are audit departments and at the federal level, their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal counting houses.
Is it easier for them to enforce local laws than for us?
I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some ways, Germany is a good example, but you can't say that it's better in everything.
Is it because they're better at control?
Certainly not, but I repeat, I don't like that comparison.
But even the model countries have a lot of problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any benefit from working with our office, would they?
Speaking of domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution, are they having any effect?
Given the short legal term of these amendments, it has not yet been reflected in our control work.
Since we're conducting a fact-checking, we need to take some delay into account.
We're just taking this into account in the process of preparing for future audits -- we started using our new "risk of non-economic" tool, which we've run through almost 14,000 government contracts, we've analyzed them, and there, of course, these changes will be reflected because the restrictions change, the conditions change for certain types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the passage of this bill will benefit or add to the burden of bureaucracy?
I think this bill is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it proves to be.
The problem that can arise is that the rules become "harsher" and it becomes impossible to follow them.
In the operation of the previous rules, the controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it to end up in such a harsh way?
I think not this way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let's face it, this is a dead end.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GDP will not bother businessmen with the checks of the so-called Schwarz system.
Is the Schwarz System forbidden or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of bodies that are charged with the duty to check and enforce compliance.
You can say, "We're going to change this law and fix this", but you can't say we're going to pretend like nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act has pretty strict rules about how and what should be done formally, and that's right.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best bid is disqualified because of a formal flaw.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow-covered.
Mostly passable, but with a little more caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovar region, the roads were passable, but in some places frozen and snowed.
Temperatures have dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but should be warming up a little bit during the day.
Snow has stopped falling in the region, only a small layer remains in the lowlands.
However, the Ore Mountains are covered with about a foot [30 cm] of snow.
From information received from the regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was a lower visibility due to the fog.
The R6 expressway and first class roads in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, care should be taken, for example, on bridges where the surface may be rough and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain roads, are passable.
But in some areas, the remains of the frozen snow still remain.
The roads on high ground are especially dangerous.
The Pardubice and the Kralevo-Gradec regions
The Czech Roads and Motorways Administration informs on its website that some roads in the eastern part of the Czech Republic are threatened with hail, and on mountain roads and roads located on high altitudes, there may be a layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about the ice that can form especially in the highlands of the Pardubice region.
The glacier may be near Lanskroun, Usti-nad-Orlicem, Polick, Svitavi or Visoke-Mito especially on second and third class roads.
I/43 and I/34, near Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Snow is particularly heavy on the roads of the Krkonoše and Orlic Mountains.
The snow cover is on roads located on the high ground in the districts of Rykhnow nad Kneznou and Trutnow.
In the eastern Czech Republic today is a changeable cloudy without rainfall.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degrees Celsius, with light winds.
The region of Plzeň
Roads in the Pilsner region are passable this morning, but in some places you have to be careful and adapt to the weather.
The morning is chilly, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, some places may be slippery.
At times, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information provided by the regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now almost unrestricted, however, road operators recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzeň and Tahowe, there may be some areas of open ground.
Class 2 and 3 roads are wet, and in this case too, a warning is in effect due to the possibility of slippery sections.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the little-used roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the Olomouc Highlands should be aware of the snow on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Kršij.
At night, snowfall forced road workers to go out, according to information from the road administration, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperka.
In other areas of the country, the roads are generally open.
"On the heights of Shumperka, there are remnants of snow.
Drivers heading towards Yesenik should be aware of the presence of snow in the Chervenogorsk Saddle", the dispatcher of the Chernobyl Road Administration told Czech News Agency.
At night, their colleagues from Yesenik went to clear the roads, they made sure that the roads on the heights after being treated with chemicals remained bare and wet.
In Olomowitz, the roads are open to all traffic, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in the forested areas, where the humidity is still present.
The Usti region, the Liberec region
This morning, road workers in northern Bohemia are reporting that there are still some hard-to-reach spots.
According to the police database, apart from several places with ice or snow, the mountain road from Telnitsya to Klinec in the Ustech region is closed.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so the snow and ice on the roads remain. In the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Czech Sredníhorje, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
No reports of any roadway complications.
Road workers report a hailstorm in the vicinity of Stetti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for its formation at night - it rained and snowed all day, and the night sky cleared and frosts began.
There are reports of unfavorable conditions on the main highway and on the I/13 road on the border of the Ustech and Liberec Territories.
Due to the curved under the layer of snow, the branches of trees touching the road were forced to close the road in Telnitsa on Kninitsa.
Shimon Ornest: We want to build positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world coming in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing stories that we humans have so easy access to.
The Tap Tap and I are constantly joking about this and saying that we are the only band in the world that can harness enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In fact, in December you're going to give three concerts, all very unique, against the end of the world.
Could you tell us more about that for our readers?
This is a nationwide fundraiser that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing power of the Mayan calendar, which is set to end on December 21st at 11:10.
The day before this event, December 20 at 21:00 three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with that idea?
It was my idea at first, but then we came up with it with our artist Gonzalo Augusta.
In addition to wanting to build up enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think, together with the public, about the kind of world we will one day pass on to our children.
To celebrate the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and in this way you can also support us.
The Tap Tap band along with other musicians also performed an anti-doomsday anthem, which is called "Doomsday Canceled".
Will the YouTube anthem that has become a favorite of the audience be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the end, if it works out and the world doesn't end.
It's sung by all the artists at all the concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be played simultaneously on Czech television.
The lyrics were written by and portrayed Jesus in the music video by Tomas Ganak, also featuring Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other figures in Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively involve them in these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What's the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
We have been working with the civil society group Tap at the Edlichka Institute for six years to purchase equipment for the STUDEO, a barrier-free education centre.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Yedlichka Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves don't have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them that opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Edlicki Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
What were the criteria for selection?
We've tried to make a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bongo and Irgi Suhi will perform.
For more details, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "grand events" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the U.S., would love to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have plans for abroad, you've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How are you coping with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of luggage and tool boxes.
However, so far we have been able to do this without any problems. ČSA Czech Airlines and British Airways British Airways have always been excellent for us, which has surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we just returned, everything went smoothly.
And so traveling abroad allows you to compare different countries in terms of accessibility, attitudes of the public towards the disabled and so on.
What have you faced up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything is working better than here, in Russia we have witnessed that in the East it is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, Moscow has many barriers, and it is still a novelty to move independently in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Nor are such trivial things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are also social organizations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, is the point where we have to keep up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are way behind the curve.
But it's important to remember that improving a situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it's normal for people with severe disabilities to be able to walk on their own, to go to the toilet, to the museum, to go anywhere...
It's not very common for a lot of people with disabilities to be active in the community, but we're a little bit ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Public respect or tolerance is one thing, but the moment we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us, then things really start to change.
So far, these are the only people with strong wills.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band right now, but let's go back two years, what made you start it in 1998?
I went to the Edlichka Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself and I play the saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, as our host Ladzia Angelovich says, over time, it got a little out of control.
Has the popularity only come in the last few years, or am I confused?
It's true, we've been helped by the fact that we've started to join the famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the band.
We've come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate is essentially non-existent.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Was it your goal to do The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of things in show business that imitate each other.
It's logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering and all the abandoned individuals that we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities are successful, it's not just a change for them, it's a change for society.
Did the fact that you are the strict leader that many people think you are, ensure your success?
If we want to do a job well, we have to be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think that's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and they're flying high, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend a prep class and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
There is only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012, at 9:00 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - in the Fléda club and in Ostrava - in the Plynojem center with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a bridge as The Tap Tap performs "The End of the World is Nowhere".
The goal of this project is to raise 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert are 400 CZK, for children up to 12 years old, the entrance is free.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the European Space Agency Ministerial Meeting, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has taken an active part in a number of the agency's projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in spaceflight, but this was not always met with understanding.
I will remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory the ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Petri and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was a prominent astronomer and cosmonaut who was a pioneer in the field of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned propagandist of space science, and his contribution was recognized in part by the naming of one of the craters on the far side of the Moon in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway train, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It's not even clear if a missile was used to accelerate or to slow the carriage.
The only information about this drezinja is from the press of that era.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The research was carried out by the Section of Armament Technology in cooperation with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzitski.
The surviving material shows that the research had reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter-rocket, proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the next year the work "Air rocket-torpedo and aviation rocket-bomb" by author Leliwy-Kzywoblotsky was published.
Both designs were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all military projects of missile technology were handled by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity, the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of the society was in the November 1954 issue of the magazine "Problemy", which published four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in cosmonautics.
At that time, satellite projects were gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn POA became its full member.
The following year, the first chairman of the PIA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the Polish Air Force has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was subsequently built, and in the summer of 1959 tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were conducted in the Bled Desert.
This missile was about 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kilograms.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could cover 14.5 km, and its task was to observe high-altitude winds.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B had a space of 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C had a space of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aviation developed the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The 380 kg launch weight of the Meteor-2 rocket was capable of carrying a 10 kg payload to an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in the research of space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Germashovsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repeal of the public works act is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court overturned the public works law.
The decision sparked a lively debate in the community.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
What this essentially means is that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
It's about the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The result of a significant difference in the cost of labour (wage) is a price tension.
Under this concept, we must understand the state when the producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to survive in economic competition by "beating" the value of the competitor in order to take a large part of the market and, thus, increase their own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production overseas, or buying cheaply overseas, or disappearing, resulting in higher unemployment in those countries where labor costs are higher than in others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditure of the state on social needs is growing.
In general, the situation is exacerbated by the reluctance of businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and economic damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
The unfair practices of private capital create a situation at the level of the economies of individual states, where governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving their own people over to private capital, despite the social decay.
This is reflected above all in changes to the existing legislation.
The aim is to force its people economically to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for curtailing the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing, and so is the gap between the rich and the poor.
For several years now, the Federal Republic of Germany has been providing food to the poor, who cannot feed themselves.
The number of these people is already approaching one million.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases where people in employment receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra money to ensure that they receive the minimum subsistence.
A similar scandal became public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern EU states are undoubtedly leading to the same situation, where people, under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status, are either forced to emigrate, as they did in the 19th century, or to live on a meager wage in the back of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, the Indian, the Brazilian, the Turkish, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still work for a share of the European wage.
This is all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are sick of the idea that the state cannot participate in the capital of the economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by controlling its actions.
The next question is whether private capital, which now practically controls politics and the state as a whole, is acting for its own selfish purposes.
The answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, in mutual benefit, in a law where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to lack of funds, the state ministries entrust the drafting of bills to private law firms that are closely connected with industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution says, but from financial and power groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly finding itself in the situation described by Appian in "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has long since collapsed, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal charity with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote"...the ordinary people did not run for the post of ruler at all, after all, once the state remained without a consul for eight months".. .. "Seriously began to talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person ".. Appian thought that it would be Pompey, but it became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy with autocracy.
As in the past, today's society is dominated by the reckless pursuit of self-interest, without regard for the public interest.
Private capital is not, by its very nature, intended for public use.
The result is the same as it was in the past: an unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out deeper reforms.
So the reason for the rise of fascist and communist regimes is that we have to look for the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
The first tragedy is that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity as we know it from old and new history.
Repeal of the public works law is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at the international, national and European levels, the Czech government will be forced to continue to seek ways to further lower the social standard of the population.
This is a systemic trend.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's share in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence, and it never can". Sting, "Fragile", where the main line of the chorus is "we never forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, they would not have been". - dying Gutel Schnapper, wife of Meir Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza has, as always, caused a lot of reactions.
Some support Israel, arguing that Israel has the right to defend itself, while Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the Israeli state is racist, that Palestinians are genocidal, and that Israel is a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the perpetrator and who the victim in these periodic waves of murder, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-ruled territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and did not witness the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of it is derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the prime mover of events in modern history.
Human history is primarily the history of power struggles.
In every age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not clear is whether these men always took their own steps, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions toward predetermined goals.
It must be assumed that we live in a period when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes with it could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered the head of the spur (I don't know if someone stands above them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They're not much of a story.
Of course you do.
They bought their first news agency, Reuters, in the 1890s to stop the rumors linking their name to criminal activities in the higher realms, which they were shadowed by, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both.
They have large equity stakes in almost all the world's central banks, and they are waging or preparing war against countries in whose central banks they do not have a stake (there were only 7 countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Qaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began issuing his own (poni-mai - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
John F. Kennedy, who started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963.
Their lust for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a three world wars plan created by the great 33rd degree Mason Albert Pike.
The first war was to destroy the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (there would be enough slaves to provide them with comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism could not be anything other than a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is to call for a crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which was supposed to prevent a repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they had succeeded in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, starting a Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge military reparations, which created the prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only to throw the Germans a strong enough, exposing the guilty and offering simple solutions Leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and indeed played the role of the fifth column, in igniting the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created the preconditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it's hard to judge whether Hitler broke free from the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by war reparations for World War II, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed for World War III.
If the international bankers manage to unravel it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become a victim of the fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, to put it more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only domestically but internationally (just take the sharp division of people into pro-Israel and anti-Israel).
Who is the guilty party and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
It is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, the international bankers are pushing people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, international banker-loyal politician who will do anything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of all the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
How true are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will embrace a new world order".
The new world order they envision is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocrats who enjoy the comforts of home.
A world where every newborn organism is implanted with a chip that makes them a fully controlled being.
"It makes all persons, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one can buy or sell except the one having the mark, the name of the beast or the number of its name.
This calls for wisdom. Anyone who has insight can calculate the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.
Operation Argo: When the worst comes to the worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution to the United States, which had been a patron of his regime for decades.
The US administration did not see the positive outcome of the situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
Defeat in Iran was a major factor in Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
Directed by actor Ben Affleck, Operation Argo is an episode in history that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult stint, they ended their journey at the Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, working with the Canadian government, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story that they had left on Canadian passports as part of a film crew looking for a location in the country for a science fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, the film was written about in the magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The Affleck film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "movie-kinopus", the story of a successful plot, a scam - an example can be a series of films about the friends of Ocean.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, the documentary-conceived scenes from Tehran (titles show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the light-hearted Hollywood passages, interspersed with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other agencies, where men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the agency's stairs, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has done a great job of resetting his career.
The mocked actor became a respected director, and his performance was no longer the object of ridicule.
Operation Argo is his third feature film, following the dark detective Goodbye Baby Goodbye (2007) and the thriller The City (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film not to be shot in the director's hometown of Boston.
The sense of place is one of the qualities that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows that in Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the embassy fall are impressive with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere suddenly the story changes.
Afflek and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite well with these few, sometimes he makes things up - there it all comes out not so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at the Tehran airport, and the chase on the runway looks rather fanciful).
The disadvantage of Argo is the scatteriness associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood co-stars are indeed charming, but their characters deserve more space, and they're far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the staging and the retro style that recreates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to catch.
But this is enough to remind us of one still somewhat alive story, and to show how the idea of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence agencies is exaggerated.
Rules of ballooning, bananas and the circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop".
"We were spurred to this by the latest development, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies", Patrick Nager, the organizer of the poll, told Prav.
Among the absurdities already nominated is the recent decision of the European Court to unite the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
Until now, women have had the benefit of life insurance because insurance companies have seen them as objectively less exposed to risk.
"The next incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward for competition by the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place until the end of February 2013", Nager said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel, which has resulted in environmental damage, the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively few dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of the cage for chickens, which has resulted in a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term "sandwich oil" or the removal of classic light bulbs from sale has also been criticized.
A good banana is about four inches long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes decisions under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even defends the demands of its banks under the threat of veto).
The lobby's interests are as follows: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and could not show "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission's justification was that it was only harmonizing existing disparate national rules that were making trade difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, has softened standards on fruit and vegetables, citing that the existing directives will lead to waste.
Last year's EU regulation, which requires that balloons be marked with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision, may also be a candidate to win the poll.
The EU has turned to US studies that show that balloons are a potential cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are prohibited from blowing into fairground fights.
Funny ideas are born at home too
The rule for European officials themselves is also absurd enough: anyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, but must instead say "BYRM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the liberal economists' association "The Non-Interference Principle" (Laissez Faire), has proposed for voting, in addition to the few absurd rules mentioned above, for example, the EU rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of the member state.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks that can be stored in the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the prescribed quantities of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for the application for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation", said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslaw Palas (PSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the state had full warehouses of stocks that had to be taken out.
Because the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
The subsidy was offered to the villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be used to draw up an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Exceptional orders are the exception
While decisions in member states are easily criticized, the EU's efforts to regulate and to make the EU more efficient and more developed are, in the opinion of many experts, more to be commended.
The problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU funds for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have agreed to at budgetary level.
It is also causing emotions among the Czechs that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians kept the name "Olomoutsky syrky", however, "Tuzemsky rum", whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename it "Tuzemak".
Only products made from cane distillate can be called rum, not sugar beet.
The official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous "feta" and "gorgonzol" cheeses, marzipan from the German Lübeck or Parma ham, has already been, for example, Karlovy Vary sausages, Gorzhelya and Trzebny carp and Zhatta.
The Pardubice Gingerbread and the Gorgie Pipes are also proud of their EU trademark.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says.
Senator, how does a man think of running for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If things were running smoothly in this country, I wouldn't run for office.
But I can't stand to see this country go from rags to riches, from thieves to tax increases to retirement ages.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent man, not affiliated with any party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but then you went to the presidential palace.
Do you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've said all along that I would run for the presidency depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
I don't want to be in a position, but a position is a tool to implement my ideas.
So I need the most influence and the most power.
But the problem is not just that we as a nation are sitting in our bars and watching TV, but that we are ready to trample on anyone who tries to make a difference.
Add to that the media that denigrates the individual and that confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was accused of bribing journalists or of being an advisor to Irja Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You started the presidential campaign with a thesis on the financial and criminal responsibility of politicians and on the return of property declarations for an amount of more than twenty million.
To do that, we need to change the law.
You as president have no such authority, and only the full Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for the tourism industry to be free enterprise, it was pushed.
The problem is that politicians, when someone comes with a good proposal, left or right, they deliberately create obstacles, and that holds back the citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more right-wing or more left-wing?
From a Czech perspective, I think people think of me as more of a leftist.
It doesn't matter to me at all whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about being left or right, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether it is proposed by the CPPM or the GDP, and I will be against a bad idea in the same way.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove that by what you've said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and visions.
And that's what you're trying to get to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already operating in the world, or are being discussed by leading experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with nothing but slogans.
And you won't last long in politics with that.
Or do you think that if you go out and talk to people, you can get away with criminal and financial liability?
I don't have any other options.
Just convince the politicians, the journalists and the public and try to win them over so that we can get our way.
If I were elected president, it would be no problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize financial and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there's a strong personality who can speak out about abuse, then we can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president -- it was the result of public pressure.
I'll be blunt, I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to stand up for my beliefs and my views.
I'm just a newcomer to politics, and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to get my own business going, and if that doesn't work, I'm going to graduate in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds partly as if Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know I can't do anything on my own, so I've rounded up a number of prominent people with offers to run for the Senate.
I went to see Radem Janchur, he said no because of the amount of work.
I also at least supported the leading investigative journalist, Jana Lorenzova, who exposed the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I'm running because people are really unhappy, but right now I feel like I'm on a scale.
Sixty percent of the people didn't vote, and most of those who did voted for the establishment.
There are only two of us independents in the Senate.
The people have elected the Senate in such a way that change will be difficult to bring about.
But I will fight for my beliefs, for example, in the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the background of every potential supporter, and I don't have the money.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, and I have only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property taxes, how are your own affairs with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately $60 million.
I have a property in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth a million, and a few more millions in the account.
And by the way, I got the Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream, and I always liked James Bond, who drove around, was gentle with women, and at the same time, fought against vice and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, own $60 million in real estate, and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million dollars to campaign with.
I have to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors is a sign that my program isn't very interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses will be covered by my senate salary.
But I wouldn't have lived on that money, for example, to pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut back on this activity?
But it's not about the salary.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be the silver-haired one who would keep the Republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much do you usually make as an entrepreneur every month?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, that's what I get, and then some.
And if I were president, I'd be done with my business.

MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not just in the imagination - Spekkenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, we finally have something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, walking along the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a large company nearby, says, "No, this building is really beautiful".
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPads, and e-books.
Nobody volunteers for old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
Speikennisse, a sleepy little town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate situation, it was decided some years ago to contribute to the general education system by building seven fictitious bridges, which are depicted on the euro banknotes as colorful miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this enlightenment initiative was modest.
And then the town fathers realized that the only way they had left to beat the statistics was to build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, master of bold column diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, took on the task with his usual composure and appeared at the competition audition in 2003 with five books under his mouse and a grin on his face.
As the jury looked around and shook their heads, the impudent Maas built a pyramid out of his original gift and concluded his defense of the project with the words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Speknisse, the so called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain worth 30 million euros has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office, and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, "Knijnsberg" was awarded the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the Dutch national competition for wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb that previously offered nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades evoke the idea of a dairy, has become richer in one modern architectural work.
But the most important thing is that in Spaykeniss the first public building of cultural significance in the history of this town appeared.
The long road to the book
First impression: a book El Dorado under the cheese cover.
There is only one elevator, which runs through the center of the mountain range, so true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore the area on foot.
The light-filled, easily visible glassed-in building, its hard-painted floors, and its elegant street lamps all create the unmistakable feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The eye is searching for benches, dogs, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves are along the facades, and in the middle is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and faceless", says Vini Maas.
We've turned the classic configuration of space upside down and pulled the reading area inward.
The interior of the book mountain is well-used: the center has offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center, and technical facilities.
Especially pleasing are the black bookshelves, which serve as walls, railings, and stair rails.
They have a unique look, texture, and smell.
Even the most experienced architects and civil engineers are puzzled by this unknown material.
"We were looking to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trauborst, the project manager representing the community of Spekenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once, on an agricultural farm in Frisland, we found a suitable by-product of farming.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a root pad.
It's cheap and it saves time.
Thin textiles are good for a season or two, after which they can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas -- the first of its kind -- was pressed into a four-centimeter-thick panel.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) is transformed into a dark, uniform, durable material, with a smell a little like a new car and a little like a pair of sneakers.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who makes the 500-mile journey will be rewarded at the literary café with not only fantastic views of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and wood ficus in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, and first of all the right humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an example of an ecological project", says Troeborst.
The earth's heat is used to heat and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain is covered with a glass cover, even on clear days the sun only shines inside for a short time.
The wide cork-wood farms, perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned earlier, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaeghe was here too.
And also a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buckenberg "the Speknisses soul that has long been missing".
The reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his or her congregation.
These books were to fill the empty shelves of the not-yet-fully-stocked library - at that time it contained 70,000 books.
It worked.
The regiments are all set up.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that because of our invitation, every resident is now connected in some way to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
So MVRDV has solved the royal task, which in professional jargon is called creating an identity.
Speikennisse wrote his literary history.
And they're very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
In the opinion of Stefan Sabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, by doing so, Berlin is balancing on a diplomatic tightrope.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first made it clear earlier this week that it would vote against the Palestinian bid for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why? Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
NATO eventually made this offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from a policy that was, so to speak, run by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a common policy.
So the Germans are again caught between two fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I believe that while they are only beginning to play their role, they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or the UK have.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is the willingness to take a position in your national interest that is not dependent on the position of the United States or your European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other large states, and Germany must therefore protect its own interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly the Gulf states.
So she needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab world.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't put too much stock in it, it's not a completely one-way communication.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany hurt its relationship with the United States by abstaining on important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the German position is being understood.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly vetoed it.
Is there a disagreement between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But given the political situation in the country, the government cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that the significant differences in opinion are not at all as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is not at all fond of Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and its status as a key partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would have been a little bit easier if there had been a unified, uncontroversial European policy, but that's not the case now.
So they can't speak to the larger picture and instead have to act on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the formulation of a common European position.
It's not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties to Israel.
It's always been a touchy subject.
But I think the Germans understand that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take the lead?
Or is Germany still struggling to take the lead?
Germany is not used to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still always difficult to play a significant role.
Take the euro crisis, for example, where every time Germany takes a big role, there are all kinds of anti-German sentiments.
The Germans are not easily able to cope with this.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
She has to consider the different neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is steadily declining, but at the moment the EU is not filling that vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more significant role.
Even if you don't like it, or it's unpleasant or it makes you feel unloved, that's life!

China's "trademark protection": when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a fully registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies it's derived from.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
But it's still unclear whether they'll be able to assert their rights.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to defend their trademarks in China", says Thomas Patloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in trademark infringement cases in the Far East.
I have a new case like this on my desk every week.
For copycats, it's just a matter of adding a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci you get Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma, are being legally copied in this way.
Patloche opens the file with records from the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are the world champions in copyright infringement.
In the big cities there are department stores with many floors, selling almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattolach's case is not like that, for he opposes the idea that Chinese companies should be granted the right to use a trademark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "ban minpai", the mark of a passenger.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
It's a nickname for women who go after rich men.
Chinese authorities deny any involvement
"It's damaging to business, and it needs to be addressed", Patloch believes.
"The brand is being eroded, the unique position is being lost, the image is being hurt very badly".
The financial losses and the procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market, with sales of 15 billion euros a year.
However, it is difficult and expensive to obtain the deletion of questionable entries in the register of trademarks.
The process can take up to nine years, with no clear outcome.
Patloch tells of cases in which the court rejected claims, since after a long time the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unsuccessful, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, since he damaged his trademark in China, Patloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court case against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, which had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
So the Chinese still have the right to use the Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo, Geely, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be at fault.
The CTMO's trademark office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to lack of staff and equipment.
But last year, there was a "return to normalcy in the workflow from an emergency".
The number of pending objections dropped by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, a 75 percent increase over the previous year.
However, at least 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
It 's costly to fight .
As is often the case in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
The record means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, the agency said.
The same goes for the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
Protesting against it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to get the illegal production of counterfeit car parts to stop.
However, the impersonator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a personal omission, since surnames are not protected in Germany, says Hannon Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trademark office of the CTMO rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won the next two instances, but the other side continues to fight until now.
The Need to Be on the Watch
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a successful conclusion and praises the professionalism of the court.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of our time, money and nerves".
The internal costs are barely accounted for, and the firm's archives have had to sift through even century-old records to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had offered the other side a "large six-figure sum in euros" for a settlement, but to no avail.
"This shows how much it costs us", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over into Europe.
That is, if the impersonators register unregistered trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long since ceased production in these areas, but despite this, it was able to prevent registration.
"You have to be on your toes", says Wentzler.
Both he and Attorney Patloch are advising German businesses to be very careful with China.
Rather than relying on international trademark laws, Wentzler says, foreigners should "register anything that is worth protecting in China as well".
Otherwise, it could cost a lot more than registering.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the other party the licensing fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we'll be forced out of the market in a contested segment.
The World AIDS Day: to help, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg, the ImBonga Choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are rejoicing.
A story of a relationship that spans more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, the clap-clap: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boats, and men's slippers pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only after this do the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly grow in number, advancing, charming, and following one another.
Fitte Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his mother-of-pearl shoes as he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imboga choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from human genetics to janitor, came to rehearse.
"Om" "Obani" is a difficult thing, because each voice in the choir has its own text, and it's in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to the estimate of Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, there are some 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans of AIDS in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzgeni, Voices for Africa found a chef in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares them for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on the guardian role.
It guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi is Zulu for storyteller or praiser.
This is a hall where they don't speak Bantu fluently, but they can sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign, soft language, and occasionally even bringing them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzjeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent of the population is infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents to HIV.
Esitjeni is a miniature of the disease of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male genitalia, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost unheard of in the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and death in their mid-forties is not uncommon.
The choir discovered this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the members of Imbogny saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but also simply: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by the individual participants to send their child to school for a few euros a year and to give them a hot meal once a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has been caring almost professionally for AIDS orphans in Esetjune ever since.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
The lobular pediculosis and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
Among heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
The HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but they account for about 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than other population groups.
European data show that three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
We also have a high incidence of human papillomavirus among young people.
How is the number of cases of infection changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than last year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases may cause genital ulcers, urinary complaints, discharge, lower abdominal pain, and blisters or thickening.
However, they often go unnoticed and are not accompanied by pain or other symptoms.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
In fact, some sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
So experts recommend regular checkups, especially if you have frequently switched partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid long-term consequences.
The leadership, the donations and, not least, the fees for the choir's performances all over Germany make it possible to collect something.
"We have already sent about €200,000 to Essythenie", says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscientious and active woman.
She also ensures that the orphans are well-settled, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the Zulu call the old women, are the mainstay of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, giving them shelter and making sure that the children in uniform show up for school on time every day.
Those who have no relatives are taken to the shelter by Hanicile, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who prepare food for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, arranged for many villagers to be tested for HIV.
It's hard to imagine, but the disease that's so obvious across the country, is being kept quiet.
The King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it is associated with sexuality".
Quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent years.
But it also lies with the migrant workers who are spreading the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally everywhere, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh".
To encourage a little cultural exchange, the Ibmoghi Choir travels to southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many in the southern tip of the continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good cheer and joy, but even, on occasion, has brought tears to the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esztergom, where the singers visit the children in the underground.
Although the small village is hard to find on a map, it is more than famous in the valley of the Ezulveni River.
"Go to Eszgenit, there is light", - say the locals.
And after the 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that the light is also burning here.
NASA is discovering ice on Mercury .
The Messenger probe found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that the planet's perpetually shadowed region is covered in ice.
It must be at least 12 inches [30 cm] thick, and possibly up to 65 feet [20 m] thick.
The water is thought to have come from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the probe's scientific director, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other places in the solar system.
Undetected by the people of Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots like the Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send back images to Earth, little windows into an endless valley.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a planet, according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union definition.
This fragment of the Spitzer infrared image is a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars as blue dots, the pink "newborn" stars more difficult to identify in the stellar circle.
This star-forming region - scientists unflinchingly call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This extreme heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is made of material that the star discarded in the process of dying.
In the giant Triffid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are being born from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope has captured this image of the galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
Of course, with a telescope, the colors work better.
As the red eye flashes the observer, the Centipede Nebula is seen in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity to the earth's continent has given the nebula its nickname, "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides a vivid color rendering.
This new star in all its glory was photographed only by the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came to be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's possible that these are fragments of a Saturn moon that vanished without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most vivid Hubble images ever taken: the Milky Way
Depending on the colour transmission, the images of spiral galaxies are transformed into works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula, a star several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Triphid comes from the Latin trifidus, meaning three-pointed, three-parted, because dark bands of dust divide the hot heart of the star's cradle into three parts.
In the constellation of Cygnus, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are hurtling toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This is a star birth that the Hubble telescope captured in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations can call it the Southern Chain Wheel.
This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cephas.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star nebula is home to the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star crib is constantly producing new stars.
This star cloud, joined with the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers speculate that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeim - before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescopes have had more and more mirrors - and more and more depths to look at.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Halle telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror pictured here was five meters in diameter.
The Big Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, U.S.A.
It allows you to look into space through two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a gigantic internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Great South African Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce cost.
Nevertheless, it is about 35 feet [11 m] in diameter.
The disadvantage of the low-cost design: the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is its high light-absorbing capacity.
It is comparable to the world's largest telescopes, despite its relatively small diameter.
With the help of the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening for signals from outer space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, anyone with a computer can help by contributing their computing power.
A view of the observatory of the European astronomical service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which lives up to its name.
Its four mirrors allow it to illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum in the optical tube.
The ESO Observatory in Chile is also planning to install a European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters long - and will be made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors, each measuring ten meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes to observe the sky.
Also, a new giant telescope - with a mirror a hundred feet [30 m] in diameter - is to be installed on Mauna Kea.
Here they can be admired in the illustrations.
But the most important views from space are from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets outside our solar system - primarily those with life potential.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photo shows the final preparations for the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on the Ariane 5 rocket no earlier than 2018.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists speculate that there is ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger is orbiting closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar readings for decades have shown that Mercury has ice.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.
Drink butter every day and live to be 168 years old .
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents are reaching a Biblically respectable age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A quest for the answer in a country where 97-year-olds still look comparatively young.
Many residents of southern Azerbaijan are reaching a Biblically honorable age.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Finding the answer in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
The ride through the Talish Mountains is wild and romantic.
The minibus rolls along a winding road that passes by thickly forested hills, wild groves, and simple peasant homes.
It's so green and bright, you'd think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost tip of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the Talysh, a Caucasian people about whom little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and are long-lived.
The end point is Lerick.
The small town boasts of its heavy-duty Soviet-era architecture, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost never come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to travel 200 miles (323 km), since the road is single-lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this province.
However, Pilata Fatuleeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku was celebrated with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have the festival of the world's oldest people", says Fatuleva.
She's the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biography of about eight dozen of these sites, which are more than 100 years old, is documented here.
This is my grandfather, he's been here 120 years.
At the age of 136 he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Muslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
Birth certificates, however, are missing.
And given that the oldest person whose age is documented is 122 years old, Ms. Musliumov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973", explains Fatuleva.
The man was married three times, had 23 children, and allegedly had a daughter at the age of 136.
So did the Muslumov's shepherd add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-livers in Central Asia.
"There are also a surprising number of very old people in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and Sardinia is also home to a very large number of very old people".
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age was impossible, as there were no civil status registers.
A glass of melted butter every day .
Yet it is a fact that people in the Lyric area are surprisingly likely to reach the Biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years old.
Why are there so many long-livers here in the South?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the talish.
The museum director, Fatoulaeva, on the other hand, believes it's about food.
The Talysh people love meat, bread, and most of all dairy products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet is nutritionally healthy.
Or is it the primitive way of life that keeps people young?
At 97, she's still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, who already have grandchildren.
Also, two little kids are jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is served to guests in typical bubble-shaped cups of armuda.
Mirzayeva has perfectly straight and strong white teeth, and she hides under her headscarf a long, dark-blonde hair, which her son proudly unfolds before us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so it never falls out and stays in color.
"I have never used shampoo", Mirzayeva says.
A monthly pension is enough for a living .
She always ate what grew in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in my life.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the military.
It was the worst since World War II.
But it got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan practically knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
Yet there is no poverty among the old people of Azerbaijan.
230 manats (roughly the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is a sum that can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's grown son is right too: "The elderly are deeply respected in our culture".
They live in a big family, loved, cared for and happy.
What 's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible ?
The word "human rights" is not in the constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are a sign of the deep divisions in the country.
The proposed constitution, based on Sharia, met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president was not stingy with the pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and nonreligious Egyptians.
For all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are experiencing fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the constitutional court's jurisdiction and expanded his jurisdiction "to save the revolution".
However, what the 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the US University of Southern California really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians and the rest of the world.
Will the judiciary be stripped of its powers?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged through the night in a 15-hour hurdle race to an Islamist-minded constituent assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the judicial process is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what is "principles"?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one may fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal loophole to interpret the Sharia more strictly.
At least, this is what one newly introduced article suggests: in all matters related to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution and highly respected in all Sunni Islam, should be brought to the council.
It shouldn't, but it could mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto have the effect of limiting the judicial power.
A lot of the constitution is subject to interpretation .
Another problem is that the civil rights of civilians must be preserved.
These courts, during Mubarak's rule, served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The bill also states that the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values".
It's so legally vague that government agencies can use it to control the content of movies and literature.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
No article in the Constitution expressly establishes equality between men and women.
The other prohibits insulting and slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what exactly constitutes an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that the wording "insulting people" is prohibited.
Will it be enough to make caricatures of the president or jokes about the law?
The issue of interpretation, like much of this bill, which Morsi is offering to sign and which, he says, will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum "very soon".
The revolution is back.
For weeks, there has been a growing opposition to the Islamist supremacy.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El Baradei, said the draft constitution was "a piece of history".
Through a short news feed on Twitter, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down", said opposition politician Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged", Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under veils and Salafist supporters who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded from Morsi: "Clear the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution".
The struggle for power over the symbolic square where it all began has provoked a state of virtual civil war.
Morsi's followers were clearly not willing to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
The majority of the Islamists are in favor, so it's done.
"The concept of 'human rights' is not mentioned once"
Hafiz Abu Sayed is furious at this forcible constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
Now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Morsi's influence over all three branches of government in the state is frustrating to the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto abolished it", laments Saeda.
Without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels abandoned by everyone, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile's different sections with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be retribution.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control".
Norwegian hake: the world's worst smelling fish?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the secret of this country's success have something to do with its local fondness for one particularly foul-smelling fish dish?
Have some overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get a kick-ass smell of the rakifisk, one of Norway's most famous delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
The snow-covered landscapes are beautiful, but the air is permeated with a characteristic smell.
A rackfish is a trout that is sprinkled with salt and left in the water for up to a year, depending on the type of bait that you want to catch.
As dusk thickens and the weather turns cold, crowds of Norwegians gather at the festival in Fagernes to celebrate this very, shall we say, exciting dish.
"They eat it raw and drink it with a drink of aquavit, the local tin vodka", explains Havard Hálvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and a "Rakfist general" by occupation, who runs the festival.
All around us, people eat small pieces of fish and drink large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like aquavit more than shrimp", says Howard.
This drink is capable of stopping the smell.
I'm gonna try a few pieces.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not so bad - it's not unlike the sushi you've been carrying around on the bus.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish was soaked in the fall in sealed barrels with salt water.
Then, in the depth of winter, when the fish were well and thoroughly fermented, they were drawn out and, after being diluted with alcohol, eaten.
The memory of the previous generation is that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 percent of the population being immigrants, drawn here by jobs, high wages and a developed welfare system.
The Swedish population (an old rival, and not so long ago a much more affluent neighbor) comes here in droves to work.
Rakkfisk is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, if somewhat sinister, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich can cost you £9 ($14).
Norway rarely makes headlines around the world, and most of the country seems to be okay with that.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the one that happened on July 22".
It is hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens would be capable of such atrocities and murder.
Norway's present prosperity is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity", says Anna, our waitress, who carries plates with a long-sleeved rakvish, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic prosperity.
We are a people of - as you call it - reason.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don't like to be seen, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful with its oil - much of the oil and gas industry's income is invested in a special fund set up for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when everyone was spending money they didn't have, Norway was very conservative in calculating its costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, that's enough to make you happy", says Anna.
"And there's the raccoon", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in line for some food in the snow - I'm tired of the shrimp.
This is a moose burger, which is definitely an exotic, delicious, juicy meat.
But in the evening, we will be greeted by even more of the same fish, with a memorable aroma.
There's a special fish-of-the-river dinner at my hotel where the guests vote on the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
It's a live TV broadcast of a butterfly-tie anchor surrounded by plates of crabfish.
This is like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"Then, Thor-Jurgen, what is your estimate of the best fish in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, this is our rating"...
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls off a chair, possibly from overdosing on aquavit.
Or maybe just by inhaling the scent of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is about to embark on a difficult career.
As Mexico's newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly bad state right now.
This city is congested with traffic at its best, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to stop people from going to work from the suburbs, but to prevent the protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico's new leader, Enrique Peña Nieto, will take the presidential oath and assume the reins of government.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has made good economic progress under the administration of Felipe Calderon, who is now stepping down, but the country is mired in a drug war that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its commitment to combat violence", Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.
Prior to his statements alongside the US president, Mr Pena Nieto's political career had been as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, the vast state surrounding the capital was divided over the new leader.
A man of integrity .
In the idyllic town of Val-de-Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
Residents credit him with reviving tourism, developing the resort area and creating infrastructure.
The town is reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are markedly different from the roads with potholes and pits that were previously on the site.
His name is on a plaque on the modern sports center building and on an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are hoping for real and serious change with him", says his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by Peña Nieto.
We expect the real and decisive changes that our country so desperately needs, primarily in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous rule, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12 years of absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also refutes the allegations of ineffectiveness that the opposition has made against the new president.
He's very straightforward and very committed to his vision for the future of the country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, a great listener.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nessauaalcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden beneath the overpasses of the highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also of a severe nature in this metropolis.
Troops were deployed earlier this year to quell drug gangs in the area; violence against women is particularly acute.
In the past two years alone, dozens of women have been found dead in the desert near a vast landfill.
More than a thousand women were murdered in Mexico State during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto - far more than in the notoriously violent Ciudad Juárez, which has become a byword for the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's opponents say that he has failed to address the issue of female homicide during his time as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this dilapidated area, Irineia Buendia barely holds back tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her roommate.
"When I got to her house, it was as if her body had been washed", recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs of a beating, and the body was already decomposed.
Mariana's mother tells the story, and her portrait looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to a crucifix with just one word on it: justice.
That's what they say this family was denied.
"I was treated by state officials as an old gossip, a disgruntled disturber.
They want people to just believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it's not right, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings", she says.
By wearing the presidential vest on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a heavy responsibility along with her.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has promised to make it a priority during his term.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was as governor", says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo for the PRI.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecution claims.
Prosecutors are trying to disprove Bradley Manning's claims of poor detention conditions.
During the hearing, the focus was on Manning's time in the military prison at Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is requesting a mistrial on the grounds that Manning's detention was cruel and unusual.
A U.S. Army private is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest classified leak in U.S. history, had missed numerous opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he said he had suffered while in military prison.
During cross-examination at a pretrial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fane stated that the records of Manning's weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months of confinement at Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, in the context of the defense's motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published online on the website WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the records that were filled out by Manning's visiting administration officials during his time at Quantico Prison, where he was held under house arrest from July 2010 to April 2011.
During these visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated the treatment he received from the prison administration as "excellent" and the overall conditions of detention as "very professionally organized".
The reviewed reports contain no complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about his conditions of detention, Fein argues.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns verbally and that administration officials who visited him had discussed the issues with him and said they would address them, but had not put them in writing.
"They recorded 'no problems' (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in conversation", Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of the ill-treatment in January 2011 during a commission hearing on the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to get his "trauma warning" removed and his prison sentence reduced.
Military officials explained that the limited detention regime - a level below the suicide prevention surveillance regime - was introduced to protect the prisoner and also for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I was okay, that they would lift the trauma prevention regime... that my standard of living would improve, from my perspective", Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at the Naval Base at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had suicidal thoughts while in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness because of the extreme heat.
He explained that it was psychologically very difficult when you're not told how your destiny is being decided, and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to the size of Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison", Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in this cage".
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - in total isolation.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, spandex, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, because sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime was against the rules.
Manning said that during his sleep, he was constantly hit in the eyes by light from outside the chamber.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned over in bed at night, he said he was awakened and made to turn over on his back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal objection to Manning's wrongful treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made during Thursday's deposition that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at the morning check.
Manning said he had no way to cover himself with a blanket during the sweep.
Responding to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw away a blanket that could cover him, but admitted that no one had specifically ordered him to throw it away.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the night before for trying to show the officer that he was no threat.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could have used a rubber hose or a spanking to injure himself, but did not do so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, shorts and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least consider what he endured while in prison and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is convicted by a military court, which is due to start hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to propose Manning plead guilty to lesser charges and dispute other charges as excessive.
The resumption of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held at Quantico under the most stringent rules for detainees.
Among the charges against Manning are aiding the enemy, unlawfully facilitating the publication of data on the Internet, transmitting information related to national defense, and the theft of state property or documents.
If he's convicted on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My national crisis is the story of a Mexican-American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the country of difficult times.
Rubén Navarrete believes that Mexican-Americans are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals hallway, approached the border control area, and froze in place.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a term, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I settled on the complex construction of "Mexican-American".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conventional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than native speakers, and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I got my American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when Mexico's newly elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda included the usual issues for the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto has talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, which means that Mexicans can now, with the same success, stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the U.S. and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and long-standing issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and, at the barrel of a gun, forced its leaders to give up half their territory.
But Mexicans think in centuries, not minutes, and they see the memory of those events in everything.
So when any U.S. official says a word of criticism toward Mexico, the press and the Mexican elite are quick to complain that the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are full of war.
The most complex of these is Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about grievances?
There's enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country and people who don't.
In Los Angeles, in Las Vegas, in Phoenix, in Denver, in San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for one reason: at some point in their family history, someone -- a father or a grandfather -- didn't have the opportunity to make a living in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type -- dark, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, and we've gone to good schools and got good jobs, but we must never forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national identity is confused and unclear, but we know which country to call our own.
The United States of America.
Besides, we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We're giving them the same answer.
They see us as a reminder of their humiliating defeat and treat us as second-class citizens, not true Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico aren't strong enough.
Our very existence is a failure to them.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain, finding a life in the U.S.A. and losing our spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved to the United States legally as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans -- that Mexicans have a clear sense of their national identity, and Mexican-Americans are offended by that.
She's a U.S. citizen and she feels she belongs to both of those countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also like Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the U.S., we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my visit, as if our relations weren't already complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to repair relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to act as a sort of ambassador for Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country this is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It's not gonna work.
Too much of a past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is all that beautiful.
Sorry, but you're on your own, amigos.
And that's only fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what it did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still resent the way their relatives were treated in Mexico not so long ago.
I know.
I guess we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for future peace
Is a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed is leading to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There are the familiar, pointless arguments about who started it; the destruction of many buildings; the deaths of more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis; and, for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from Gaza have landed in the vicinity of Israel's capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly mired in their age-old conflict, change has come to the Middle East.
One can react to this in different ways, but the events of the "Arab Spring" have swept many established realities into a rebellious storm, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay out of the storm that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their fight will be even more bloody than before.
But there are reasons for hope in this deadly impasse.
A War Without a Winner
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire signed on November 21 is enforced, this week's clashes have only strengthened the position of the security forces on both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they had suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group's leaders have been killed and 1.7 million people are trapped in one of the most populous and troubled parts of the world, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamist movements grow in influence in the Arab world, Hamas is gaining new influential and wealthy friends.
A rising regional leader, Turkey, once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has come out in support of Hamas; Qatar, one of the Gulf's richest and most dynamic states, has followed suit.
Celebratory Hamas supporters claim to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the militant Hezbollah group, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are poised to topple Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where the king's authority is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant shift in the balance of power in the region occurred on Israel's southern border, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood movement gained strength under President Mohamed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was ousted in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is an organization that is very similar to Hamas, and its leaders are more populist.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
Hamas was defeated militarily.
The Iron Dome missile defense system was cost-effective and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas missiles launched.
The citizens of Israel can sleep well, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US has remained true to its unchanging stance; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the deaths of some 30 Israelis from rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by building a wall that encroaches on the West Bank - a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party has teamed up with an even more aggressive conservative, Avigdor Lieberman, in preparation for the January 22 elections, is in a comfortable position.
What's the point of flattering the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If you give them the power in the West Bank, won't they start firing rockets at Israel, like their brothers in the Gaza Strip?
It's best to keep them on the wall and to stifle any attempt to raise their heads.
The hardliners may win; however, their calculations may be overturned by the Arab Spring.
With Islamists coming to power in Egypt and elsewhere feeling less than warm feelings towards Israel, their priority will be domestic issues.
Israel's defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Going to war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the Egyptian president, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could signal the beginning of a change.
Israel, no less, must consider the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change begins to take hold in Arab countries, the denial of Palestinian self-determination is a time bomb that will eventually explode in the occupied territories, like the bus bombing in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - is only exacerbating these problems.
The bloodshed that occurs every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas is paying the price of growing international discontent.
Both sides need an external impulse.
There remains one solution, one that has been repeatedly called for by the sane representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and the ceding of territories to Israel in exchange for security.
The hope remains, not too impressive in the short term, that a cease-fire will allow other countries to have a more effective influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has long since decided to cut off its arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and Qatar are in an unprecedentedly advantageous position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, which have been agreed since 1967, with the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of a virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows a reluctance to get involved in the problem.
That is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
That's only possible with a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has introduced a uniform packaging law for cigarettes.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the depiction of diseased body parts are contrasted on the dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
Australia's first-ever uniform packaging law for cigarettes and tobacco products took effect, replacing the logos and color scheme of different brands with a uniform olive-coloured box with gruesome images of diseased body parts and children whose health has been compromised by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packages, introduced in the mandatory order from this Saturday, is the name of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the most stringent regulations in the world for tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia says that the measure is designed to discourage young people from smoking, thus stripping the habit of its fashionable status.
The decision was based on research showing that 99 out of 100 people who did not start smoking before age 26 never became smokers.
"It's clear that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through the packaging", explains Health Minister Tanja Pliberec, citing studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest smoking rates in the world, so these changes will not have a major impact on the profits of multinational corporations, although other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry was strongly opposed to the law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This bill will have a far more serious impact than the people who originally proposed it had in mind", says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Fake manufacturers from China and Indonesia will supply many more of these goods to sell on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, the new laws have helped to grow their businesses.
Sandra Ha of the small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for ports and silicone cases to hide the objectionable images on the packaging has increased rapidly (from almost zero) since two months ago when companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in the High Court of Australia where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand items to wholesale businesses and is waiting for a new batch.
It's good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures, according to experts, is the popularity of social media among the very population targeted by the measures.
After a series of laws were passed in Australia that made it illegal to advertise cigarettes on television and to promote sports events, and that prohibited vendors from displaying cigarettes in public, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict foreign websites from doing so.
"If you're a tobacco salesman and you have this one small loophole, the idea of promoting your product online is very tempting", explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes the rise of brand reviews written by so-called ordinary users on social media sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is this really the work of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he took the time and effort to make a video, or is it the work of an advertising company?
British American Tobacco's Australian branch claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new regulations than advertising.
Tobacco industry representatives have gone as far as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: These nations are filing claims with the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, even though all of these countries have very little trade with Australia.
A decision by the WTO is expected by mid-2013.
Tanni Plibbersek said the government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to make it mandatory to post pictures warning of the dangers of smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrating a defiance of innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just take a cigarette out and put it in your pocket", explains Victor El Haig, a cigarette shopper with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that could make me quit is my little girl.
James Yu, the manager of King of the Pack tobacco shop in Sydney's CBD, claims that the same packaging has made it difficult to arrange the products on the shelves
"It used to take me an hour to unload a new shipment, but now it takes me four hours", he laments.
"The government should have taken it and banned cigarettes altogether, we would have said, 'What are we going to do, it's over, we're closing the shop,'" he says, waving his hands.
Boredom in a world of electronic networks and fixed connections isn't so bad.
On that Thanksgiving, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical failure and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I won't deceive you.
A half-day in an airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and books, magazines, iPhones, even duty-free stores, don't do much good.
However, more and more scientists and child- development experts are speaking out in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and our children to be bored.
It forces the brain to divert to interesting, related topics, which may be conducive to creativity.
And in today's world, because we're all in front of screens all the time, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should aim for boredom?
I know.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, as many others have, that boredom was an invention of the relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
Not so, says Peter Toui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history", he says.
Latin inscriptions about boredom dating back to the first century C.E. have been found on walls in Pompeii.
But it leaves open the question of how we define boredom.
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an adjunct professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research on this subject and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boredom is when people "want but are unable to do something that would bring them satisfaction".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do what he would like to do.
Apathy is the state of doing nothing.
The key to boredom, he says, is "attention deficit and the associated mood decline and the feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can be described as being very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and in circumstances, while depressed people see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're really just having trouble focusing.
In their study, "The Untrained Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape recording of a person reading a journal.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of an unrelated television program in a nearby room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume so that they could hardly be heard, and a third group listened only to a voice recording without a separate audio track.
The participants who heard the TV at a low volume reported that they were bored more often than others -- they had difficulty concentrating, but they didn't know why, and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupted attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we are doing something uninteresting, "such as looking at the flow of goods on the assembly line in search of a marriage, distracting music can help to escape boredom".
It was thought, he continues, that when people started to roll around in a chair or doodle on a piece of paper, they did it out of boredom, but we now know that it was actually just a way to physically keep them from relaxing.
"Research has shown that children who are allowed to twirl and turn around learn better and retain more information than children who are required to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point: a delayed flight, as I did, a monotonous speech, a boring movie.
However, different people exhibit different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980's, researchers developed a "boredom scale" to measure such individual traits.
The scale uses questions and statements to assess the performance of a person, such as "Many of my tasks are dull and monotonous" or "I am too busy to do anything".
Using such questionnaires, researchers found that boys are more likely to be bored than girls, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he paged nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
And he got the following results: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Yet, only 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what similar data on boredom would be like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "the teenage years are the peak of boredom", mainly because children and teenagers are not allowed to have full control over what they do.
So back to my original question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes it doesn't, because in extreme cases, research shows, it can push people into absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or substance abuse in an attempt to escape boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have pondered the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has spent more than two decades studying the problem.
"That's how our brain tells us to do something else; that's what boredom is", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, that same brain does not always know what to do.
If you get bored and you direct that energy to playing guitar or cooking experiments, you'll do yourself a better job.
However, if you watch television, you will feel better for a while, and soon it will pass.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom on his own or manage his time and activity in any other way", says Professor Fenske.
"And these self-regulating skills are used in a wide variety of situations", he says.
Your child is learning not only to do things for himself, but also to have self-control in general.
I don't think boredom needs to be glorified.
But it's not a bad thing either.
Rather, you should learn to be comfortable with the non-stop flow of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see it as a need to get bored more often, when boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful", he says.
In fact, people are looking for a way to get away from the stress of life and just relax.
"In today's world", he says, "we are used to constantly over-stimulating our senses, and when the silence comes, we are lost and don't know what to do".
It's unclear how Colorado's new marijuana law will be enforced.
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old football player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a felony that will soon be legal across the state: possession of a small amount of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and a friend were in Lamar and driving across the prairie near the Kansas border when they were pulled over by the police.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was served with a court order for possession of narcotics and possession of a narcotic device - minor offenses, each of which carries a $100 fine - and a court date.
"We are treated like criminals", says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has persisted for weeks after Colorado voted to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, hundreds of small-time lawsuits are being decided not so much by the law as by the venue.
Small-time marijuana charges are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has taken a similar action.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be legal once the law is in effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have decided to pursue existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute people for possession of the drug.
At the same time, some cities from the Denver suburbs to the mountains of the West are voting to stop the establishment of new, state-licensed marijuana shops.
"It's all happening so fast that I don't even know what to expect", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, a town east of Denver.
The regulatory authorities in Washington state are also scratching their heads in confusion.
They will have to formulate rules to determine the licensing process for the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most other states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for recreation.
"Colorado is a more regulated market, so they'll set a good example", explains Brian I. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But at this point, Mr. Smith admits, all anyone can do is make some suggestions and hope that they work.
"We don't have a real precedent to go by", he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will take effect on December 6 and put the state in a state of uncertainty for an entire year, with no state licensing system yet and the right to possess marijuana already legalized.
And there are also some difficult technical issues that need to be addressed during this time, such as how to balance a state mandate for "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on selling it within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and daycare centers.
"It will be especially difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses in the inner cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs", explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed Center for Marijuana Legalization, a research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his subordinates saying that the city's prosecutor's office will no longer charge anyone over the age of 21 with possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police would stop implicating people in these offenses "from this moment forward".
Police Chief Oates said that the police would monitor the town's compliance with regulations governing the cultivation of medical marijuana and would prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The Uld County District Attorney for northern Colorado, Ken Buck, takes a more rigorous approach to the issue.
After the bill was voted on, he said the prosecution would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mainly to encourage users to seek treatment.
At this point, 119 individuals have been charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, though many of them are also charged with other offenses.
"The duty of our office is to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response was mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police department in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer charges adults for possession of a small amount of narcotics.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in the already open marijuana possession cases.
"I believe it is our direct duty to ensure that the law is respected until it is changed", he says.
Although 55 percent of the voters in Colorado supported the decision, it will not be easy to bring marijuana recreational use into the state and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions of residents in various parts of the state have exposed the ambiguity of the local government's attitude to the state's experiment with marijuana.
"District attorneys have a cultural barrier on this issue", explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents convicted marijuana users and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've been persecuting people for so long that they can't really accept that it's not a crime anymore", he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana the same way as alcohol, are destined to become a nationwide testing ground for the very idea of drug legalization.
Legalization advocates and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxiously awaiting instructions from federal authorities who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization supporters are hoping the Justice Department will back down on this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients, the federal government has largely given the green light to the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug enforcement agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug counselor in the Obama administration.
Some Colorado towns didn't wait for the federal government to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local governments approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which would not be able to open for another year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is expected to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we give somebody a license and then it causes a big problem at the federal level", says Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our town voted against this amendment.
And now we have a discrepancy between the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many unanswered questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was expelled from Oxford for being a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their beliefs is not new.
For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to go to Oxford.
My father and older brother attended Oxford, and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at Worcester College, Oxford University, in the late 1980s, I packed my bags and left, which led to the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't hold back and cried.
The friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had left college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from a straw cup.
It wasn't that funny.
I got away.
Yes, I did, because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
It wasn't because of my rather unusual name or that I went to a private school.
I was poisoned for one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it seemed like sheer barbarism and blind bigotry: my father, the late Woodrow White, was a famous advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a Conservative.
You might ask, why bring it up now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with a right-of-center view is being subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of conservative students demanded the same protections for their rights as those afforded to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Corpus Christi College's Cambridge student club say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel like unwelcome guests" because of their political views.
They want to add an additional representative to the college's Equal Rights Commission to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right", which portrayed conservatives as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, riding in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver navel.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are "put to death for raising tuition".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "the left-wing bias is increasing in the university environment.
People who do not even know us assume that we are the brazen, unpunished children of rich parents".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi College who filed for the protection, calls the atmosphere "unwelcoming", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of the student club members towards centre-rightists has deteriorated significantly.
"It's a threat to the intellectual discussion atmosphere and the normal life of the club members", she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I entered in September 1986, a shy and timid 18-year-old.
Oxford was a fevered hatred of the Conservative Party.
The year before, the university voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of cuts to higher education funding.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman week, as the students got to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I had a future.
I didn't know that the faculty not only looked the other way when they were harassing conservative students, but they were also very much a part of it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and the government's refusal to impose sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - permeated the wooden-paneled walls of the auditoriums.
For my first seminar, I had to translate an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt", said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph".
I had a hard time with the lyrics, and I got stuck.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face like a cake.
"Do the Thatcherites have no intention of learning French, or are they just lacking in brains?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I would advise you to take a few introductory French lessons in your spare time, unless you are very busy going about in society", Pitt said.
I went back to my room feeling very unhappy.
That evening at college, I was sitting alone at lunch; then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year English student who introduced himself as a member of the university's Conservation Association.
"I know who you are", he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the facts are as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most Conservative freshmen are pretending to be Labour".
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman in the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious".
The other students picked up on his words.
I was spoiled, I was dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" one of them asked.
- They're stabbing each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the criminal penalties were abolished in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only at night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour Party member and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years began to feel like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who was open about his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He was a bit of a no-show in college.
He despised him for his provincialism, his pettiness and his commitment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began traveling to Oxford from my parents' London home, seeking refuge among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best university in the world", he said, mourning.
- They can't do that in the city of sleeping spikes.
Even my Communist friends have always behaved perfectly".
His wet eyes went dark.
"Don't make any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it was a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave".
I was exhausted by the constant commutes to London and my emotional defenses were weak.
My friend, also a conservative, couldn't resist the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The next week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me "enemy of the people" in all seriousness, I decided to do the same.
Burning with shame, I confessed that my parents had "brainwashed me", and I called them "old fools".
The break was short.
The final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was to be hammered into my father.
At the time, he wrote two weekly columns for Rupert Murdoch's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a whiner and a rag.
But no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in an institution at the age of 18.
More tragically, it was Oxford that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still today hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and free thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the "Valentino: the master of sewing" exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC is speaking with Naty Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other prominent clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of England's Queen Elizabeth I, is the only place in the British capital to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of "Valentino: the master of sewing", a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his "house" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says in his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of a story whose only character is "il signor" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his celebrated clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, is full of personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from a humble tailor from the northern Italian town of Voghera to the idol of an international "elite".
There's nothing wrong with being in love with a royal court.
"At least they don't blow their cigarettes out on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a master of no equal, and he welcomes his guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved coming to his chalet in Gstaad", explains ex-wife "Heiney" Thiessen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Anelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, who represents Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza is remembered as a charismatic fashion designer.
We went to his house for dinner once, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 invited were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decor, in the food, in the music.
"Valentino made each guest feel important and loved", recalls the "top model", who began working with the designer in 1995 during Paris Fashion Week.
"He never goes out of style because his sketches are works of art", she concludes.
The parade of the lineage
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He likes people with good education and high titles, and they like him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters long, which offers a change of role: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk down the podium, gazing at the "spectators" of dreadlocks that sparkle with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti used in "Notti", or the coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Empress Diarra.
In this audience, such names shine through as Sibyl of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taksis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Gabsburg.
Nati Abascal and the fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget it".
I remember him well.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're very light and they match his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed as Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed I'd be old enough and have a reason to wear one of his evening gowns...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990's.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear at the wedding at the castle of my cousin, Prince Édouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a skirt, a corsage in a fold and a cut without a bracelet.
"It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her designer's holiday dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale at the Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls her seamstresses) to produce this garment of pearl-encrusted ivory silk, twelve different loops, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long (45.5 feet) loop.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority on the business press, the dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century, "the return of the high-end clientele".
After years of being fooled by the elite's "lifestyle", Valentino is now its best representative.
Knight of the Grand Cross (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Knight of the Order of Merit, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, and recipient of the Legion of Honor, Garavani has received as many honors as any of his female clients.
"I was always attracted by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and flawless appearance", recalls Dr. Ahrenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musee d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was flawless, time doesn't exist for him".
If the princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: the miners of Kawah-Ijen
Indonesian miners risk their lives and health to haul 70 kilograms of sulfur up the steep rocky trails to the top of a volcano for four euros
There are people who think their jobs are hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
Among them is Antho Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Antho descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfuric gas rises from the depths of the Earth, freezing upon contact with air.
He carves out huge pieces of sulfur, weighing up to 70 kilograms, and he lays them in two bamboo baskets, puts the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up the steep, rocky road.
The summit of the 2,386-meter-high volcano is only 250 meters, but it takes the exhausted truckers more than 40 minutes to climb with a tortoise-like stride, struggling to maintain balance and carefully tapping the road to avoid slipping and falling off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Cave-Ijean a few years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocents for every kilogram of sulphur they extract
Once on top, they make their way among the tourists, who take photographs of them as if they were circus monkeys, and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company has placed just above, at an altitude of 6,200 feet [1,850 m].
We are talking about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960, and, better not to mention, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian Rupees (5 Euro cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industries, as this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar bleaching.
"Because the norm is a 70-kilogram load, we earn about 46,000 rupees (£3.50) for each load", explains Antô, who usually does three daily loads.
He spends three hours on each of them and feels crushed at the end, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (US$40.00) by the end of the day.
While it may seem a pittance for such an inhuman endeavor, it's three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage for miners is very high by local standards, where the coffee harvest is 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", explains a shipper who used to work as a stonemason on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary there was 75,000 rupees a day and the site was not that hard, but Antho returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where she was a Hindu, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he coughs constantly, and his eyes are watering from toxic gases.
At 27, Anto spent three years risking his life in Kawah-ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got tears in his eyes from the toxic gases that the volcano is releasing.
It's the price he has to pay for his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and smart young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or a hotel porter, but instead he's doing the work of a mule.
To share his filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up at two o'clock every morning, because the sulfur never stops flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and sparkles in the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Antô descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers, who work for their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they don't even get a fraction of the 30,000 rupee (2.5 euros) photo-taking fee that, along with the 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) admission ticket, the park guards charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its mule people.
"This job is for cattle, not for people", says Badrusin, a 42-year-old corn-fed porter who has spent three decades at Kawah-Ijen since leaving college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will work "as long as he can" because he needs money for the education of his three children, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano is my life.
Although the sulphur burns their throats and eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in thick pillars of smoke rising from the volcano, they are so enduring that none of them complain of their severe illnesses... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knee pain, and ulcers on the shoulders that have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unaynik can now lift only 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his companions haul 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamanusari, over a narrow, 18 kilometer [18 km] trail through the thick brush.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life", declares Unaiknik, opening his mouth wide, which is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works as a sulfur courier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates one of the most difficult jobs in the world, the work of the human mules of Kawah-Ejen, from generation to generation.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of housing and education for the lack of children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm a patriot husband, you're my patriot wife, we do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of a peppermint ad, but despite this -- or perhaps because of this -- this video became a YouTube hit in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings such as "Let's put bao in the stove" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made the video, BBH, hopes to use the ads to bring attention to the problem in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty".
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in the country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing our own kind, so we felt like this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like launch pheromone sprays or have bliss parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, which is to write a rap?
1.2 of the child
Whoever doesn't take this lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and tax breaks.
But all of this is low-efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and its strict public controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population administration, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what's known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Policy Unit of the National Population Administration, says that the reason is "improved education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"It has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in singleness and the delay in marriage and childbearing, resulting in a declining birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which aims to dramatically increase immigration to counter the decline in population, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore that are flourishing with a thinly veiled xenophobia towards many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not wanting to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year scored its worst result in an election since independence.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem by using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has some impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care spending and immigration policy, Singapore's example is also starting to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is working to reduce the number of tiny homes.
For example, it's starting to affect the real estate sector.
The city development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments, 46 square meters, are selling very well.
However, there is a perception that they may promote a single-family lifestyle and deprive developers of the incentive to build large family homes.
But Lim Yu-sung, CEO of the home-building firm EL Developers, says that their "shoe boxes" are selling much faster than the more spacious ones.
They're more popular, in the sense that they sell out for days, weeks, faster than the larger apartments.
As a result, our income increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new regulations provide clearer guidelines for developers who have previously been put on the back burner if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in a project.
Too much pressure.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the city centre, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive, education is expensive, and that's why a lot of people put it off", says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and my own time", says another young man in his 20's.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to childbearing, the ultimate decision is left to the Singaporeans.
Offline personal is online personal
Confidentiality is important.
According to the Royal Spanish Academy's dictionary, it is a property of the private or "the sphere of private life that has the right to be protected from any interference".
What is personal to a minor under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing things online that he would not likely discuss otherwise?
ElPeriódico interviewed five youngsters between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", in the personal realm, and "password and username", when applied to social networks.
"I wouldn't post my biggest secrets", says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of being private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world", he claims.
I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games to FB.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine or someone who was being silly", he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to post indecent pictures of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and the nine people he follows on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows, she has the password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're responding to me, I'm just uploading them", he adds.
"Social media is fun, and I can talk to distant relatives or friends in a quick way", he says.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't count on someone recommending him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last one admits not knowing 20 people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music", he points out.
According to the boy, no one approached him in confidence and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I am pressured or asked to do something, I will simply delete them from my account", he admits.
Jose became an Ask follower after reading a Twitter recommendation.
The boy is no stranger to what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never knew who it was", he says.
The victim, according to Jose, never deleted the account.
"I just turned on privacy".
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up the account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of people he knew in awkward or confusing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cyberbullying", he confirms.
Key issues
Marylos Porras, an English teacher and an expert in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is important to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a way to find information, but the rules of the game have changed with the advent of these sites", she says.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prensky, a master's in education from Yale University and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are those children and youth who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning ourselves", she says.
She explains that the issue is complicated "because we ask them to have a certain criteria for what they can and cannot share, publish or say, at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"They also have to be selective, whereas the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
The most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to ask thought-provoking questions, says the expert.
"Telling them not to do it is useless", she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like to have a picture of you posted, like the one you posted of your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign party photos, do you ask other people's permission to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online the same way they behave offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, and so should social media", she says.
Watching
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, elementary school teacher and educational consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of these points will give parents a good basis for discussing with their children the requirements for opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what you're allowed to share or post", he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers".
UNASUR summit ends without the publication of the Lime Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI UNASUR meeting of heads of state and government, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the homepage that it would be delivered after closing, but then confirmed that at a certain point it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was laid out by Peru's President, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Access to information about the Summit has been limited at all times.
During the day, a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound with the message "the meeting is closed, the sound is prohibited".
Some of the information that was circulated among reporters was shared by the spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments that were present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which provoked the ire of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
The Peruvian presidential administration subsequently sent an email to the media with the summit's "final declaration", but it was a statement by Umala, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite the press' insistence, the so-called Lim Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not circulated.
You can check the ASAP website to see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that all journalists had access to the information, but restricted access to the information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru jointly adopting the Hague Court verdict that settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will begin hearing both sides' statements on Monday in The Hague, as part of the indictment that Lima has brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and enforce the decision that will clarify the differences that we are presently presenting to this international court", said Umalla, standing next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, pacts and international tribunals", added Pinera, and shook hands with Umalu against the background of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will obey the International Court of Justice comes just after Colombia this week challenged the Bogotá Pact, which recognized its submission to the verdicts of this international court after the decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Olly M. Umal, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon on Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements were accepted and approved directions of action for 31 projects among South American countries, the amount of the expected investments amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements he mentioned, UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on residency".
He reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the risks of natural disasters in a collective and effective way".
Since Europe is in crisis, "economic integration (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal basis, but should serve to expand our manufacturing base and envision a better future for our cities", added Umala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes", the Peruvian president said in a statement read out.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are related to Peru, and are limited to the transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-join the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, united, and with good relations between neighbors was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he started to participate in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also at the summit, the bloc's defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter country has been suspended.
Peru has the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland".
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is endorsed by the UNASUR member countries.
"We must achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the basis of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Human Rights Pact.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, but we South Americans sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and funded by the United States", he said, alluding to Ecuador's granting political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because with it he did not betray his principles, but adhered to his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that at the time "there was some suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and not be processed".
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for requiring him to come to Sweden to be questioned about an alleged sexual assault, while "Swedish law alone allows for a videoconference to be held from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What it does have is the danger of impairing his physical and mental health by being confined to a small space without the ability to exercise in the open air.
"It affects the health of anyone", he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of inviolability that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were talks in London to find a solution to the problem of imprisoning the WikiLeaks founder.
We don't negotiate human rights, that's not a word we use in this case, but there was a constant debate.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European courts", he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, this will be over".
And if Sweden, as is perfectly allowed by its legislation and as it has done on other occasions, interrogates Ms. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him by Skype, tomorrow this problem will be over.
Correa took the opportunity to present himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt thug politicians, but bad journalists who support blackmail and extortion for profit", he said.
In this aspect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, "nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate in Ecuador", and added that, having been re-elected, he would "deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality", because in reality "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua now on the maritime borders between the two countries after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not being followed at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
We have to deal with them together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good outcome to the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court, and said that "it is right for Latin America to go to international bodies if the two countries commit to make a decision, however difficult it may be".
Regarding the possibility of running for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he views this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I've never been interested in power, but in situations of injustice like Ecuador, socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who had guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we retire from public life.
If we lose, the same.
"This is the solution", he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he's gone for treatment, which is already scheduled, routine, and that he's expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chavez's health has deteriorated", he explained.
The Ecuadorian President attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when it was announced that he had tested positive for AIDS.
"I felt as if I had been stunned", he recalls, "despite the doctor's tact, it was a difficult moment".
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to fight the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much as he could about it, and his efforts paid off - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s, it would have been difficult to believe that - there were too few treatment options, too little knowledge about the disease, too much prejudice against the sick.
For example, even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Institute of Social Protection refused to say goodbye to him "because he had a cut".
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a judgment call.
It's now possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without a deterioration in quality of life.
Yet, many people still come in unaware of their illness when the virus has already damaged, "squeezed" their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least since the first reported cases, "the big achievement at this point is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same", said the head of the HCG's HIV department, Jaime Andrade Vilyanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the time of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years when a CD4 count of 500 is reported.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed as HIV-positive at age 25 would, in these terms, "live to age 75 with no problems", he explained.
To appreciate this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While the death rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNEIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths had been reported by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it works in our hospital.
We haven't had a shortage of medicine for at least the last 12 years, the problem is that patients come in very late because they don't know they're infected, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited the overwhelming data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what we need to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose earlier, and therefore provide samples for mass detection to all the people who ask for it".
The proposal is shared by experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as by patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for testing, motivated only by the fact that a friend had done it, and despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better be getting laid three times a week", they say.
I'm doing well, I'm eating well, I'm exercising, I'm taking some medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, taking care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage his statement to those who are now experiencing fear in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them know if they're at risk of contracting HIV, let them know as soon as they know they're HIV positive, it's better, and if they're diagnosed, let them know they can live like everyone else, be responsible.
This message sums up the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter.
The gap between health programs and the average citizen is wide, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has been covering the HIV problem.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we used to be given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don't have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you need them?" is a popular question, with echoes of condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers, that teenagers don't want to hear, the propagandist asserted.
I propose that we change this inefficient distribution, so that condoms are not just behind the counter, but that hundreds of them are in the vending machines in public toilets in places that young people frequent.
It's not an incentive for debauchery.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, said Governor Emilio González when asked if it's possible to give out condoms under his administration.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already sexually active", he said.
Key facts about Jalisco
A total of 13,435 cases were recorded (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and total AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are bloodborne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, since for every registered case, there are four to five people who do not know it.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of a decision that nullifies the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group achieved through the competitive process in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures to support the survival of companies, which are allowed by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, in contradiction to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of a June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of having their properties across the Rio Grande seized.
However, the ruling opens the door for a leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three nonconformities as evidence.
As an introduction, while the judge in the case notes that the creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern the bankruptcy proceedings being heard in Mexico.
The first clause provides for the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, designating the American Law Institute as the arbiter.
Second, the verdict establishes that without the inter-company vote, the debt owed by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company would not have been reached without the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Productions.
It is also true that, subtracting the votes of the affiliates, somehow the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States courts, namely the "cranks" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
That's the data the Court of Appeals is dropping.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, hit by the severe economic crisis that has hit the United States, striking the country.
So far, the Gonzales family firm has filed an appeal of the decision to the appellate court itself, to bring the vote to its full bench, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
If unsuccessful, a petition for certiorari will be filed, which will require a review of the case by the highest court, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worse, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae ("other court") describing the process that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, signaling that it is exempting itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
It also notes that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carromballs from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit country.
The balance sheet
Given the months-long complaints filed by the Mexicana de Aviación union against the company's former owner, Gastón Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Airline Pilots' Union Association has already discovered the bottle neck.
The panel, led by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to provide reports to the Attorney General of the Republic regarding the operation performed by an entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund F/589 of IXE Bank on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The funds would be used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They 're surrounding Dragon Mart .
Gathered at a weekend forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and international environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the general civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for the products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for 150 employees.
Earlier, Canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that have razed part of the protected areas and pose serious threats against the industry.
The death of ACTA
As for the Senate's rejection of the government's request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA in English, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case has already been filed.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility of considering it as violating freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, housing developer Homex is placing 500 million pesos worth of stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical issues, with interest payments offered every 28 days.
Competival is born
Formed by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in the field of information technology, the consortium, branded Competival, has just been launched, and will target the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
The investment in this area exceeds 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hettin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
A keen basketball traveler, Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with the sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much basketball history in their memory as Hector "Hatin" Reyes.
And before a brain hemorrhage left him in a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a minor league player, a Major League Baseball player, a commissioner and executive of the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several simultaneously, as when I was president of BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation in the 90s", Reyes recalls during a visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he says that.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and mementos gathered on his long journey, testify to this.
The bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, beginning in the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years since his appearance as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or executive.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year that Jerome Minsey debuted on BSN.
From that moment on, it was run by Coco Ortiz, who was a great administrator", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, told me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"You want some?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincey could bring a championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys' championship with Gauss, but it was a long way off, because by 1988, I was the head of the federation.
By that time, I was enjoying his achievements and Minsi's achievements on the national team.
I remember when we first beat the United States in the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and it should have been bronze, if it hadn't been for that Canadian referee who made us replay the final game, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup team, is that the best team you've ever seen?
It's one of the best, just like the one that won for the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty much the same team that won bronze at the Worlds.
That team not only featured again Minci, Gauss, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculina' (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) 'Tonito' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who could not participate in '90 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us the gold medal and a lot of joy, was the team in the Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuken, Argentina, in 1995.
With players like 'Caniño' Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurrietner replacing players suspended for disorder at the Pan American Championships in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Pikulyn Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculin has.
And that's not to mention his career in the various leagues he's played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican chef?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young team, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in the BSN there were up to 17 teams in a season.
What else can you do?
There were things I wanted to do, like regionalising the smaller categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce play only in their region and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Kids travel and play too much now, and it's unnecessary.
At least I see the benefits of mandatory certification and training for executives, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Mostly I listen to music, watch YouTube music videos from my era, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been there for me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he portrayed a businessman without principles, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagen, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the studio behind the Dallas production.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, re-enacting the iconic role he loved most", said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Day Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and its sequel, was with Hegman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, fun, loving and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original personality and lived a full life", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hegman had made a name for himself on television as a straight-laced character in the light-hearted sitcom I Dream of Jeannie, which ran on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive young jinn played by Barbara Eden and begins living under the same roof.
He was also the lead in two comedies that rarely aired, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work has included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the gorgeously disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the height of his fame.
The drama series of the CBS channel about the Yue clan and other characters in its environment was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot J.R.?" ad, designed to create a buzz around the emotional episode in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international discussion and millions of dollars at stake at bookmakers.
It also helped bring the show a record audience at the time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in history, after "MASH" in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stood in her way and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others had reasons to attack him, too.
Hagman played Ewing as a voracious corrupt with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put into treatment.
"I know what should be on the tombstone of J.R"., Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, who also starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who had the privilege of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas show were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Five episodes of the second season have already been completed and a sixth was in production, the network reported.
No word from Warner or TNT on what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatre scene in the early 1950s, and then served in the RAF from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married the young Swedish artist May Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoir Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't include anything that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an advocate for organ donation and volunteered at the hospital to help patients who were experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go to the surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like "don't worry, it's gonna be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine".
He was also an active anti-smoking campaigner and was involved in several campaigns.
A course that explores the "End of the World" begins.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charme decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an unassailable lure: the end of the Mayan "long countdown", December 21, which many people have seized as evidence that the world is coming to an end.
But Sharma had no idea what was to come in the next few months: a catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis that some have called "the long-armageddon", and a growing conflict that would involve Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists believe the apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Sharme told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If you analyze what's happening in the world right now, like if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the end of the world this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, adjunct professor Barry Wacker is teaching a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time", he said, "and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are suggested to cause certain human actions".
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed apocalyptic movies and how they related to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students about what was possible, probably plausible and impossible", said Wacker.
On the main campus of Penn State, Matthew Restall, professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to give a lecture called simply "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, in case the end of the world doesn't come", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must study, prepare projects, and take final exams.
Penn State will take its final exam on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very night that the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses have proven to be quite popular.
"We ran out of seats in two hours", Restall said of his high-performing-student course, which had 35 students enrolled.
We've been getting e-mails for weeks before the semester starts from people asking if there are any openings.
The students, in turn, assert that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic mindset, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that teaches that", he noted.
I like him.
But not one of the students - let alone the professor - said that he believed the world would end on December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and we kind of discredited it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in this speculation.
"In other places, people don't think about it", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching a course in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knew of any "end of the world" courses there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world", he wrote, alluding to a higher-level order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restat noted that for a long time there had been talk of many days of the last judgment, and he said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are indifferent to this date.
Some of them said they were going to go to the end of the world party.
"Maybe I'll call some friends and have a laugh", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student in the communications department.
