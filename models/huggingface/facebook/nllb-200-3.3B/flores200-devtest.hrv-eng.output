It confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a popular theory, but it allows for details that fossils don't usually give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper part of the animal's feathers were a brownish-blue color, and the lower part was pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed plumage called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  spines I. and II.  researchers have concluded that the plumage probably arose later in evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers claim that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows the feathers of the adult specimens, not the plumage of the young.
The research showed that although it was a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen was part of the adult bird's feathers, not the chick's papery flesh.

In France, voting is traditionally done without high technology: Voters are isolated in booths, where a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate is put in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly regulated by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that at the beginning of voting there are no envelopes in them and that no envelopes are added to them except those inserted by properly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers, with strict voting control, will count the votes according to certain procedures.

The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while the emergency services are freeing the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Magistrates' Court in Edinburgh on charges of murdering his son.
She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but there's a chance that the eyewitness evidence will be derivative because many media outlets have published her photograph.
This is a well-established practice throughout the United Kingdom, but the courts in Scotland operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of the photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are dancing on a dangerous wire about the publication of photos and so on of suspects".
The Crown Office, which handles all criminal cases, has told reporters that they will not comment until the charges are filed.
The document, according to leaked information, will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the treaty, and the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence lasting only five years.
The hunters in the pilot hunt to control the insects would be under the strict supervision of park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
The qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme, as part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected to conduct the first firing operation received extensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth provisional election in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission cited CEP's previous resignation as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections that were supposed to have been held as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating causing six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, the Department of Commerce and Industry said that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
"The State Department called Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Agency of the Northern Mariana Islands has reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early as well as the Filipino photographer.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of hormones accelerated the maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two flight data recorders from the "black box".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first queen of extreme... my first manager... and she passed away in the night two months ago... pretty unique, just like her... a strong woman.'"
"Dustin 'Goldust' Runnells said 'Moon was as strange as I, if not more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place.'"
From 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic since 2008 rose by 8 percent.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during her 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share the same view and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m, 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have cast doubt on his health.
He couldn't take his painkillers because they're banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known until January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets form, especially the Earth, which was formed when comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
"He called the rumors ""political gossip and nonsense"."
He's supposed to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow for shorter flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport option will be organised and overground trains will not stop at Wembleyu.
Due to fears of transportation shortages, the possibility arose that the game would have to be moved to an indoor venue without fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's zebra, Geospiza fortes, and the newcomer of the zebra genus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes.
It can be dragged into a thin wire, which can be wound and pulled out, or it can be hammered or rolled into a plane.
"It can be very thin and stick to other metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called 'painted manuscripts.'"
It's called the chemical pH, and your marker might be the juice of the red cabbage.
The solution changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH value is denoted by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the abbreviation pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together two dry powders, and then clean them with wet hands squeeze into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause the formation of a scabby.
In Harappan and Mohenjo-Daro, each house was equipped with at least one flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the buildings of mining towns in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and during Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled socially.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the signal, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere shapes part of the light and looks.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel brought about unimaginable changes in the world, and the biggest change was that it made transportation much easier and faster.
It made possible the invention of trains, automobiles, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, which is the special position that each cat occupies, so that it doesn't have to compete with the others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
Lion dens consist of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a human.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four are the only cats that can bark.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but more like a string of incomprehensible, convoluted words.
Ocelots eat small animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and almost all the animals they prey on are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by smell, by sniffing the way the prey moved on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with night vision and move very inconspicuously.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, during a mountain or river crossing or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
The new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations from the old ones in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed a bit, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much in appearance that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and then take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce food from sunlight by photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant food, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the number one predator of its time so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaw just had over 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set of claws on the back of his neck which meant that there was no help for anyone who got in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a tongue-shaped, feeding on turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and possibly being a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to keep up with it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild boars, peacocks, sloths and foxes.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate seated at tables, while the rich enjoyed communal feasts at which they could dine on their sides.
The ancient Romans' diets could not have contained the ingredients that would come to Europe from America or Asia over the next few centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods by entertaining ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes, specific pyramids were shaped into towers, called ziggurats, that were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent out in the open.
Women cooked in the yard; shops had counters open to the road; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so the wood was extremely expensive.
The Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and gave it that name.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes had already settled there.
"Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map on it.
However, that is not true, for although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written, 'Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776.' The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down".
No one knows for sure who wrote this large document on parchment (dimensions 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches), but it is known that it was shredded for storage soon after its creation.
So, that entry was probably added simply as a tag.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an attack on southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces have liberated southern France and are moving towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together  society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of a society in some way.
Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the trace in culture and the equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, thirteen states by the Articles of Confederation first established a weak central government consisting of only the Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no state or judicial authority, it relied on authorities that were often uncooperative to enforce all laws.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and customs between states.
The treaty required the unanimous consent of all the states to amend it, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because it is made up of a cluster of islands, Japan is often called an 'archipelago' from a geographical point of view".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing along the island recorded the name Ilha Formosa, "Beautiful Island".
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan in 1624, and began to transform aboriginal practices into grain production, employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar cane plantations.
1683 - The Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) forcibly takes over the administration of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and Taiwan is declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better insight into how they were originally constructed.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still going on.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size before the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, the same ratio is used in the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
A little confusing is the fact that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of the width to the height of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio expressed in simple integers) is therefore 3: 2.
Many common formats (for example, APS group formats) are equal to or closest to this aspect ratio.
The oft-violated and derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism with some order in the picture.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under criticism.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had brought together European states with different languages and customs.
The powerful influence of Christianity affected everyone from kings to knights.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and reducing poverty and that the church's funds exist specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of the armed conflict, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in numerous international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of the ocean, endangering neutral shipping.
Given that there was little interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the pacifist attitude and separation prevailed among the majority of citizens and peoples.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with a nickel in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a clerk at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family in power was a distinctive dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed an unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars between nobles were fought over the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died in the battle for supremacy in the great palace of Xian.
The consequences are social and political, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not the ruler.
Besides, after the Revolution, employment was open to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given a chance to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because after the revolution, ranks were earned on the basis of ability, not merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond the confines of his boring life, and he would visit the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to help him think better.
The cave that has survived through history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know for sure it exists.
There's nothing to see but clear, beautiful skies and many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Necropolis of Giza"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives of Pharaoh Khufu and members of his family.
"The symbol 'crank up' looks like a V and 'crank down' looks like a staple or a square without a bottom".
The up sign means to start from the top and push the pendulum, and the down sign means to start from the frog (where the hand holds the pendulum) and pull the pendulum.
The raised cymbal usually produces a softer sound, while the lowered one is more forceful and imposing.
Feel free to add your own labels, but remember that the butt movement labels are printed for musical reasons, and they should generally be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister Elizabeth were forced by a mob of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob, in front of the terrified queen, shook the head of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profit that came from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would form the core of the profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars we must understand the context in which the order was created.
The period of these developments is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological incentive or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is guided by fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not cost-effective for just a few cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership leads to more accidents on the road, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in health care for treating injuries.
In Romanticism there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerge that are consistent with the physical residence of a society, and therefore are superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
The status deteriorated in the 12th century largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silks and spices that were of higher value than those offered by the Byzantine market.
At this time, the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the lack of communication, the styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great discoveries of that era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
Self-sufficient farming is farming to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds of indigenous ecoregions combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, as they still are in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture special may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their affiliation through the recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite examples of unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults during their development, either as a result of neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
In some cases, abandonment is the result of a parent's denial that their child has a severe intellectual or psychological impairment.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If fully raised by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within the body's limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised it, such as fear of humans or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method but a support for individuals who are faced with a new learning experience, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real; in other words, the teacher is the shape of the scaffold, as well as the animated clipboard that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
The virtual scaffolding is internalised in the software and is intended to test, instruct and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet this is the case.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster home should meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The recognizable features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"In researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998.) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continued relationships"" as new motivational aspects".
The use of video has made possible important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, argues that people who cannot understand the speech because of brain injury can still accurately assess his sincerity.
He suggested that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection is the removal of a set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift the variability between these two sources.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans have a hard time meeting their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: stunted growth, poor nutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources were the proteins from the leaves and the mushrooms, but these are hard for primates like us to digest uncooked.
In contrast, animal foods (antelopes, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but contain large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors "solved the 'protein intake' problem' in much the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah".
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal sleep period and going back to sleep shortly thereafter (10  60 minutes).
This is possible by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find you can turn off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces you to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it embraces Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga stimulates the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) with the help of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation, where the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, differences in systems, procedures and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be led by truly empowered armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost overturned overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered Poland and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern Polish regions, violating both the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The transport of goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for large numbers of people and large quantities of goods to cross the ocean.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving its own people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mostly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it had succeeded with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The pitome goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were tended by so-called kozars, usually children or adolescents, a term for shepherds who tended the goats.
Horse-drawn carriage tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to move faster and to pull more than was possible on the rougher roads of the day.
The railings were put in place early enough to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
The first all-iron railways were introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal walking occurs in australopithecines from about 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement and we can even be activists to some extent to reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment, but unless we're looking for a solution that's just temporary, we need to find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of people's overindulgence and extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress adopted the manuscript draft on July 4, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printer.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and the shipment arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 copies of Dunlap that are known to exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But many of the features of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the handling of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary characters or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look for the label for specific first-aid instructions relating to this poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the well-known rodents, insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and non-killer bedbugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living quarters they live.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Couples like that can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by the scientific method, and this method is actually the guideline for most scientific research.
In addition to these methods, experimentation, or experiments that are tests to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning, and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed its ties with Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic stimuli, have been discovered in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle freely even if there are no external signs.
The experiment that Hershey and Chase did was one of the leading proposals that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments that showed DNA in a jar of radioactive phosphorus or a protein jar of radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to work, passing by people who have just left their workplace.
In this dynamic transportation scenario, everyone is somehow connected to the transportation system based on private cars and supporting it.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has thrown the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges are rare.
Why are transportation systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger at work?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a relatively consistent way, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
To better represent the flow of traffic, links have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape from enemies more easily and more efficiently to find food and fuel.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't bend the wings of the fairy are the horse-horse and the water-monkey.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced of the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't have a sense that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main course of the Amazon River is 3,980 miles long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although stone pyramids were built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of the state's employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of one or a mixture of more than four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Remember, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close friend to a great number of people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of modern writing, the pen lost its status and fell out of use.
People write messages on computer screens these days, so they don't need a pen.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The fission bomb works by taking energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and by splitting the nucleus, some of that energy is released again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no pushing.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner in the lunar seas, thicker in the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more dark areas because the crust is thinner, the lava could have reached the surface more easily.
Content theories are focused on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growth.
These theories consider what motivates some people to want what they want and what environmental factors motivate them to do or not to do something.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge in the case of managers who start to manage their former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain 'part of the team.'"
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, assigning authority, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and do it his way.
The team leader is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often creates a rift between the leader and the rest.
Virtual teams should adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often provide a point of contact for the closest physical group.
They're often more autonomous than the traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
"The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organisation go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organisation again?
After efficient use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity are brought to the fore.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve higher degrees of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, making the field of research narrower and more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore unprecedented brain structures and processes.
It provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The study of artificial intelligence involves the construction of machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because they are embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and often the teacher would be happy to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual excursions, where students can visit a museum, an aquarium, or a beautiful art exhibit while sitting in class.
Virtual sharing of trips is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the page changes, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of memorial.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills. When students start blogging, they often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience corrects them in most cases.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to seek promotion in writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to stimulate the interest of the audience inspires them to be imaginative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to transfer learning beyond the traditional school.
"The appropriate use of blogs ""can encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively reacting to online material, students can define their own standpoints in the context of other people's writings and express their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming capital city and offers a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Slightly to the south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All of these things make Ontario feel essentially Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to plant and animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or linked to France and are famous luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area borders the Sahel in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women on the trip say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It helps if you wear a ring (except one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment and it's not unusual for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Decide to reject men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (which is not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
Casablanca, as it is known today, was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was known as a strategic port called Anfa during the Phoenician, Roman and Merenid periods.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as baguettes, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of d'anges, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gomu was devastated by a lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest trekking with mountain gorillas in Africa.
To visit Goma, a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) is available, and the normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Because of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport, Timbuktu is today an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main locations where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is a stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more of the Arab world than the African world.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River as its southern boundary.
The park's 19,500 square kilometers are divided into 14 different ecological zones, each one home to a different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be South Africa's leading national park (SANParks).
As with other South African national parks, daily conservation fees and admission fees are required.
It might also be useful to buy a wildcard that allows access to certain parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is a major center for many tourists.
The display of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is comparable to a glittering bar chart, made even more conspicuous by the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is crammed onto the landlocked land along the northern coast.
This place was appropriated by British colonialists so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps, but they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges valley.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer cubs.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most counties, they drive small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as the cities of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
The Oyapock River is spanned by a suspension bridge that connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 273 feet.
The freeway is 15 metres (49 ft) high and was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be commissioned in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco Province was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and the Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
After the Spanish conquerors met the indigenous people in the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", was born.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentine national team and its polo players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds of Las Cañitas
Smaller tournaments and matches are held in other parts of the year.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for the half-time matches, check the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and Stanley also often accepts credit cards and American dollars.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on remote islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; inquire in advance with the owner to find out what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical belt; in the summer months, temperatures of +30°C are common.
Winters can be fluidly cold: temperatures rarely go below the ice cap, but the combination of wind and moisture creates a feeling of being colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particular 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rain is generally the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management guidelines, keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, bear in mind that the scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu, and it has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval battle in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, during a peaceful gathering in the city, the murder of Tupue supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III took place.
With two harbours stretching across Auckland, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour neighborhood) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, safe for bathing, and many are sheltered by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in the Port of Waitemata, in the affluent Mission Bay and St. Heliers neighborhoods of central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded with a large number of shops lining the beach.
The main one is the local beer "Number One". The beer is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for you.
Local tap water is safe to drink but if you're a shy person, bottled water is easy to find.
"The 'straight white' portion of the coffee is foreign to Australians. The short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino is full of crushed (not foamed) and the tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is on a par with Belgian, and the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of the above causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and follow safety warnings.
The sea wasps appear near the beaches and estuaries north of 1770 from October to April, and occasionally in other months.
Sharks do exist, but they often attack humans, and most shark are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodations in advance relieves the traveler of burdens, knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation such as camping through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organized transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotels.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed to arrive at your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be made to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp at the festival site, and most consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you'll have to arrive early to take your seats.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you are travelling in the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin, as the passage through the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city.
Casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money their guests spend, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them in the building.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy roads and snow-covered roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on a clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short time to get you stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-borne snow, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic is generally continuous throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
In everyday usage, the term safari refers to a journey by land to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car, and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a 'bushem walk', 'mountain safari' or 'walking safari') consists of a walk lasting from a few hours to a few days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo, the host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you could find yourself in an uncomfortable situation.
The rules for cancellations vary, but since the end of March most coronavirus cancellation rules have not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels will rent you a drying iron and an ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a strainer, or if you don't like wearing socks, you can use a hair dryer if you're comfortable.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes just one minute for the water to boil; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have doubts, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to their region.
The pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, transmit poisons, or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually classified as pests.
The Commission also examined whether the measures in force against the PRC constitute State aid.
Travelers to high-tax countries can save a considerable amount of money, especially on the purchase of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo  Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of the steep slopes, narrow passes, and sharp bends.
The prescribed speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the cell service here is better than on many other stretches of road, such as Pennsylvania WIlds.
German baked goods are quite good and varied in Bavaria, as in the southern neighbours of the Austrians.
Fruit-based pastry desserts are common, such as apples added to year-round desserts and cherries and plums used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you fancy a small but hearty meal, try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, a Pfannkuchen, or a Krapfen.
Curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be either 'dry' or 'wet.'"
Yogurt is a common curry ingredient in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is the most commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is the umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
But when used without further elaboration, the term refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, consisting of a series of simple spicy dishes dominated by Javanese favorite flavours of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
They are steep footrests for the rider that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they also involve certain safety risks because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his leg is caught in the stirrup, the horse could pull him if he escapes.
First, most drivers wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the harness belt to be detached from the saddle if the rider pulls it back in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is Chile's main climbing destination, also known as South America's Yosemite due to its diversity of large granite cliffs and chalk.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes amidst the endless possibilities it offers.
Snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow slope using skis or a snowboard attached to the legs.
"Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as 'ski lovers' plan their annual holidays around skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking and skiing: also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although it does not usually include them.
Think of a ski trail as a similar trail to a mountain trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover some more distance than by walking, but you will very rarely reach the speed of a ski run without a heavy backpack on the paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of a number of independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean applying for a visa and passing passport checks several times.
The Schengen area, however, in this respect functions as one country.
As long as you're in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State individually, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of an antique, some tax authorities define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be smaller than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques even though they are later than similar mass-produced goods.
