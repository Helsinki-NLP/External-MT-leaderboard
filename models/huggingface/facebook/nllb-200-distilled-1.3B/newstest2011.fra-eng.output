CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or any pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD members elected to the city council of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new CSSD city council members to see if they were familiar with the argument that has been going on in the city hall in recent years, when the current coalition partners were in charge in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political elite set up during the previous era of mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was surprising to find that the newly elected officials did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I am a young man in Prague politics", said Lukas Kaucky, the culture elected to the "godfather" vocabulary test.
And as for the veteran politician, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only phrase you're suggesting I use".
Otherwise, I don't use the slang.
The editorial team has selected six examples from the vocabulary, the expressions of which were published by the daily Aktualne.cz in June this year before the ODS' pre-election congress, with priority given to those related to the Prague city hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to the pastry shop", "beef nerve", "treason of the capital" and "to be a fool".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who will lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth-seeded Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I am not concerned with these matters and how the representatives of the citizen democracy are amused: I will not give my opinion".
"I am currently working on how we will understand each other in our programmes", he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that he is the influential Janousek on the contractors and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Ka'Kaucky and the only phrase he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel", says Kaucky, and immediately adds, "but I know it from the papers".
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course", he jokes.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmentalist, knows that the golf hole is Blanko's tunnel.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks it means "go to the bakery".
"It's about, I think, going into a company", Plachy is willing to guess that this is the headquarters of the Janousek companies.
Brezina also reminds him that he draws his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he might use.
According to the test takers, there is no jargon lexicon in social democracy.
"I have consulted with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have anything like this".
"We call each other names, sometimes using abbreviations and symbols", says Peter Hlinsky, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Grandpa to the party members or the least friendly little old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by fraud during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones admittedly used by the Social Democrats within the party.
It is reported that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has registered another nickname for the Prague president.
"Doctor in Law of the Baton" recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate in JUDr. law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", a brochure has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women who are declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, for example, they cannot work for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny".
"Young women who are healthy are also not judged because they work and give birth", says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution for more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He's published a booklet that should help limit the witch hunt.
There's a catch to this case.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are illiterate", warned the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In neighbouring Ghana, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman, died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprinkled on her.
The BBC server transmitted this information.
The criminals claim it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used in the ritual anointing caught fire when the woman touched it.
The oil caught fire, they say, when the team tried to "chase the evil spirit" out of the woman.
Isolating "witches" is approved by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman in Burkina Faso as saying: "Eaters of human minds have always been a danger".
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch hunt, Gambia has not seen the President himself participate in it until last year.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large witch hunt which allegedly contributed to her death and attempted to kill the President through black magic".
"Shamanists from neighbouring Guinea who came to the rescue brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the President's personal guard, randomly selected men and women from villages in the Gambia", Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm the prisoners were made to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: the stoves are heating, he signed a higher rent.
A large elderly man walked out the door of the customer center of the RPG Byty company of "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file under his arm with three new lease agreements for three apartments - his own, his daughter's, and his son who was serving time.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500, the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second-class apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel", points to his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway", he explains, angry and half resigned.
The citizens' association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and to wait until December 7, when a notice will be published explaining the method to follow to claim.
But the man responds to this with a hand gesture.
"One says this, the other says that", he frowned.
The Ostrava region is becoming a laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday morning at 09:00.
Right next to the door is a guard from a security company with a machine to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
One press and a piece of paper with a number on it comes out.
You don't have time to read your number "157" because your number is already starting to shine on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a split second, it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rent does not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
Most people came to settle common problems like everywhere else - claims for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people in over 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty is offering them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still being tested", says the clerk behind the counter after a moment's hesitation when the customer introduces himself as a journalist.
The dredging and the former miners' apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local issue.
The deputy speaker of the parliament from the Ostrava region, Lubomir Zaoralek, of the Social Democrats, made a rather strong statement about this before the elections and it is now filling the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor".
"They haven't even changed a fucking board in the bathroom", the man said.
However, the employees say that most of the people who come here are pensioners who want to be sure that they will get a refund on the new rent if they sign up now as RPG has promised in a special offer.
This is a refund of half the rent that will be paid to other tenants who have signed their new lease before December 15.
But the deregulation desk on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed with questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent", says the cashier.
And yet RPG has individual rent interviews on its website and in its storefronts when needed.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will decide.
'This is not a threat but only an informative way to act legally,' RPG says on its website.
"No one will go to court here", one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks, and the man on the street outside the customer centre proves her right.
"I have 13,000 crowns of pension and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court", he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see about that".
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media is asking that no one sign and so people are waiting", she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents are still not at the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund", says Pavel Klimes, director of the housing portfolio at RPG Byty, who says that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry and is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments with rents 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the padded chairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and affects no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG's apartments.'
"And it will still be at most 7.50 CZK per square metre per month", the screen says.
The 38 percent increase is for just 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really low amount of 19.66 CZK per m2", adds RPG.
Next year, the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical increase but a gradual one over four to eight years.
It adds further commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the lease agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices, the architects included.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one would have expected it to also house a mini-kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees have been able to visit.
The architectural project company Arch. Design, whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has been designing its mini-company nursery school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly of childbearing age, and it was important to her that women architects and project managers could return to work quickly.
Alongside parttime work contracts, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social programme.
This gives builders and architects the opportunity to combine demanding work with childcare.
The idea of this nursery school was conceived by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
The financial allocations (CZK 2.8 million) enabled them to purchase equipment and apparatus and, after two years, to provide qualified staff and start-up.
After the use of the funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. is obliged after 3 years to operate the mini-nursery school from its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to apply for funding.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher are on duty all day. Children can attend kindergarten without age limit but are usually over three years old.
Since it is a "mini-kindergarten", only 5 children can be present at a time, but during the day there are more who take turns.
The school is flexible in its operation according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of their position in the hierarchy.
Although it is an individual care and education, the programme of the mini-kindergarten is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children not only play here but also receive a quality education - from the beginning to school preparation, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer for the children to use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can monitor their child at any time and not have the stress of being late to pick up the children from a school far from where the parents work.
So parents use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural bond of loyalty develops between employee and employer.
Arch.Design.is thus among the companies that offer a premium bonus for recruiting new employees and are family friendly and through this programme strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric dinosaur, the staircase a dinosaur spine, and the balconies open fish mouths.
This is the case of the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house was nicknamed the Bone House by the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade resembling scales and curves everywhere - these are all typical of Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front of the house has its dreamlike lines, pleasant colors and textures that remind of nature and animals.
When you look at it in more detail, you see the geometry, the rhythm and the order, thought out with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the brilliant impression of the colors is enhanced.
The curling and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors to the same extent.
The wood is used to make window frames, railings, door decorations, eyelets, and slats.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district on Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The rebuilding took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-apartment house was not the brainchild of Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and designers also worked on the façade.
The joint work for the plans of the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and the Park Guell in which there are other works by Gaudi.
Locals nicknamed the warm house right after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "the barking house".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a unique system for the house in his time of central heating, with typical ventilation fans and chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation of the building Gaudi did not respect the building guidelines of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of construction he obtained the city's building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the city council members were not happy that the pillars of the building were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal by the city Josep Battlo requested (and was granted) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is divided by a staircase leading up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common area can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles decorating the inner courtyard and the light wells.
The two-color scheme provides maximum lighting in all floors of the house.
All you had to do was bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which absorbs sunlight.
The Casa Battlo house, which was inscribed in 2005 on the UNESCO World Heritage List, is open to all.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued to visit because they saw that it was a lucrative venture and they expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and the attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance to the monument is really cheap, costing 16.50 euros, and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders get 20 percent discount.
The price is still above the price of admission to Gaudí's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you should quickly find a companion among the inhabitants of the building and tour the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress top: Women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious setting, but rather the quality of the bed surface, so the mattress and the mattress bed provide a real base for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a particular user.
Several factors are decisive in the selection process: weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and mattress frame are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where you do not sleep continuously, latex mattresses are not suitable because they warm up slowly.
They are also heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and if they are also on a solid board, they retain moisture and mold can also form.
Habit is also a factor in the choice.
If you are traveling abroad in the cold, often with very thick mattresses with a softening layer, you will not feel comfortable on a hard, low surface.
"That's how all the hockey players come home from the NHL complaining they can't sleep there".
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that causes them to misread 'information' from the joints and skin", says Sylva Adamczikova, a specialist in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the lazy foam mattress became a favorite among hockey players and other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't look back into the night like you're out of a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The slothful foam also functions as a protection against squirrels.
To choose a mattress that is appropriate to your height, add the length of your feet, which is about 21/34 centimeters.
A man and a woman who are 180 cm tall need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example single beds, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visitor.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you lie on your back, you should rest your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent.' Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bed and Breakfasts and Decorators who has been devoting herself for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialised schools.
For a double bed, each person needs his own bed frame and mattress, so be careful when buying to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, all you have to do is raise the tree to different heights, and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which at least three cm should be counted for the form and airing layer.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress, you should not feel the springs", warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of mattress.
The bed mattress, when the mattress and the bed mattress are joined like Siamese sisters, has no place in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very badly rusted; you must not wash them, as is common today.
And since we normally sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 litres of sweat at night, it is clear that after 5/7 years the mattress begins to resemble a large (and stuffy) sieve.
So experts refuse to advertise a 25-year life for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything is at his mercy.
A practical tip from sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, forgo hygiene or washing when covering the mattress, but add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And although nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper for the whole set, that is to say that after opening you have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person only) becomes when you remove them a fight between a lightweight and a heavyweight on a ring.
You have a hard board in your bed instead of a bed frame?
I never did!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with spring bags (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of air.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-positioned slatted tops with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwich mattresses (perhaps a combination of latex and coconut) are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate the stiffness.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be used as they do not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, a so-called shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special bonding of the slats that allows the slats to be pressed or even tilted so that the sleeper's shoulder "fits" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as their backs", this is a really important thing.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who have started using a softening zone at the shoulder for "male" mattresses.
But they also think about women - they give them a softer surface at the hip again.
For the more difficult customer there are wing or padded boots with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure spreads to more points and reduces tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (big and inflated) on good mattresses and mattresses, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a very simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50x60 cm which Scandinavians prefer per sample.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level the shoulder height (with the shoulder cradle of the summit or the softened area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the earlier straw- and herb-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
The petroleum-based raw materials from which polyurethane is made are being replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The organic label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products", explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in mattress covering, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between men and women.
While birch extract for the mattress covering absorbs heat and cools the body, the covering "cools" the man, while the covering "warms" the woman.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore hotter for the weaker sex.
What are your current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of the different rigidities of the cold foam gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You'll pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and above.
Those characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex was the first to reach the top.
Saving up for a mattress and a mattress is not easy.
Occasionally, as part of special promotions by manufacturers or producers, two mattresses can be bought for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn into the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur matter at a "cosmic" rate.
It started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were subjected to enormous load factors when they started.
Tempur softens in heat and hardens in cold.
It is therefore perfectly adapted to the warm human body and distributes optimum pressure.
It is therefore ideal for preventing poor sleep and for increasing comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver or similar foam.
Tracking devices are increasingly in demand among parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their children is causing more and more people to think about tracking them through a GPS.
The system, initially set up to search for cars, can also be used to track people's movements and help in some cases, such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved many people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if it means disturbing their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy", says Petr Pilin of MACRO Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of someone who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases".
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons", adds Pilin.
He said that children should always know what the box is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if a child does not want to wear such a thing, he will get rid of it.
'And even the youngest can be very creative when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don't want to be in control.'
"Mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already made parents wait for long periods of time", says Bockova.
She said that the fact that this type of device can help in case of assault is highly questionable.
"If it is a premeditated kidnapping, the perpetrator will make sure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him".
"Now it's the phone".
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (the criminals) will also be looking for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in the event of an unplanned assault by a pedophile.
Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, a company that provides tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
'The apparatus may be configured to be in regular operation after a specified period of time.'
'In the event of the equipment being destroyed, the last position of the person concerned shall remain.'
'More expensive devices also have a tiltometer that immediately reports the position of the person who slipped and finds himself lying down without moving,' says Cech.
He said that so-called smart phones with a navigation system could provide a comparable service after being formatted with special software.
The problem with today's tracking systems is that they are either a device similar to the ones you wear in a matchbox-sized pendant or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
Pilina of Macro Weil says that this is why tests are now being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"The advantage of this is that the attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device".
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time", he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed as a bracelet or a pendant, it would still use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning systems (commonly used in navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the vehicle's current position.
The army has enough detonating ropes to go around the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense bought 224 km of them.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the ropes is two to four years at most.
The army bought detonating ropes from the STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating ropes from MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to the calculations of the reserve held by the pyrotechnicians of the army, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an annual exercise with explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
At this distance, 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the Army reserves could hold it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each new professional, as experts say, only 2 m of detonating ropes are sufficient, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet soldiers in the Rapid Reaction Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that firing sessions are limited due to the need for money.
The lack of body linen is not a topic of conversation.
"And I don't mind if they buy such a large quantity of detonating ropes from us".
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing".
"For us the army is a good customer that we as traders strive to satisfy", says Jan Decky, commercial manager at STV Group.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonating ropes is based on the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports that detonating ropes have a lifespan of only four years and police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
"If they are properly stored in the warehouses, it can be up to four years", said one of the two who did not want to be named because of the criticism of the army.
Once the expiration date has passed, each round must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier's life.
These tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a discount due to the quantity per 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km", says spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter for the Ministry of Defense's buyers.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of detonating ropes by police pyrotechnicians who neutralize munitions from World War II or those from the Soviet army does not exceed 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before their useful life ends.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to enable more flexible and modern types of detonating ropes to be obtained.
The Ministry of Defence is now having great problems in neutralizing tens of tons of munitions from the Warsaw Pact era when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move towards the Rhine.
What awaits the Czech army in a few years, which MF DNES contacted, is to neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cords which it now buys "cheaply".
To this day I still benefit from the contacts I have made through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur contest.
Last year's winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His journey to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun was a traveller.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
With his savings from his work abroad and a bank loan, he bought a small building of five apartments that was half demolished.
This was a courageous move, considering that he was still a third-year student at a university.
"The quality-price ratio of accommodation in our area made me want to do something", says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profits in the building, which he converted into a 54-bed boarding house.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has enabled him to open 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another one of the same quality happened to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise came forward", the number one entrepreneur of last year.
"And for the sale of the licence to operate a large-scale hotel, winning the entrepreneur of the year competition was a good thing", Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and being known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often complimented me, and I must say it was very nice", he recalls.
He recommends that all who are trying to do something participate in this contest.
It's not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be seen is good.
He says he's still using his contacts and knowledge that he couldn't have gotten in any other way.
"I started to establish regular business relationships with the people I met through the competition.
He said that the reputation associated with success also had an impact on the employees.
And he's got about 70.
"What I notice most about them is loyalty and pride in being committed to something that has been generally recognized".
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work by all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward", says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's sense of purpose, Farmet has the worst of times behind him.
The man who came to Slovansky Dum to collect the first place prize in the Vodafone Company of the Year contest last year is Karel Zdarsky, the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury praised his efforts in turning a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but also my staff and increased our confidence to fight the competition,' says the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the property was confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they started to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
After eighteen years it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company became known even to the general public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers become really familiar with the Farmet brand but also foreign partners who have started to realise that they are working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country", says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year was not a year of euphoria at Farmet.
The company was assessed on the basis of the economic results of 2008 and partly 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the toughest year for engineering machine sales.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment plans and start to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We obviously didn't escape this situation".
"Turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to reduce production and even lay off workers", explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and kept the profitable results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
"We have built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presence at international exhibitions and won major awards at national exhibitions", says Zdarsky.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are rising and so is the number of employees.
"I wish the new winner that pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere", says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes the stupid regulations.
The absurdity of the year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations may have been abolished.
The unfortunate winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year poll was the requirement to bring in offices of documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, whereas the official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
It's all gonna change with the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the extract from the Commercial Register for checks on insurance payments", said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
The aim of this year's Absurdity of the Year contest is to highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to comply with in the Czech Republic and to have those that are absurd removed.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters showed up, at least 4,000 this year have voted.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the enterprise, and,this, increasingly.
"We may be among the world's top tax returns", says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, up 8 places from last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first launched in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September each year, the last deadline before the contest closes.
The organisers of the contest then select seven candidates for the "antiprix" and let the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that receives the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, it was a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that lost their meaning of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also by trade unions and teachers.
The 'finalists' in the competition, and therefore the nominees, include, for example, the requirement that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with 20 employees repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the contest, which always starts in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a regular event attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the State is putting a foot in the foot of entrepreneurs and for this my aim is to remove, every year, at least 30 paragraphs which today only complicate business,' said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to abolish absurd decrees is not a slap in the face.
In 2007, what people didn't like was the requirement for entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance to the office for the sole proprietorship at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Law on Individual Enterprises.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day business trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the text of the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything's fine until the third session of the contest.
The absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their practice, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sport projects are evaluated.
The new feature of this year's competition, which has been running for five years, is the category 'Responsible Firm of the Year 2010'.
The aim of this competition is to support a fair and reasonable business.
"We want to support companies that monitor their business' environmental impact and are socially responsible", says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile phone operator Vodaphone, which sponsors and promotes the contest, as well as the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this first year of this sub-category of the 2010 Firm of the Year competition, organised by Vodaphone, companies that are not successful with a single long-term business objective have entered.
The adventure of each of them is inspiring and an independent article should be published.
Although the purpose of their enterprise is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns disabled people and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of its employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible firm in the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which for 17 years has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for disabled children.
The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of the workers, was awarded the title of the company responsible for the Central Bohemian region and was placed third in the region in the Vodaphone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won by introducing flexible working hours and even reducing them to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she buys first from Czech manufacturers, supports a local business and is concerned about the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment", explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit in the Usti region also cares about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages them to work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadows Foundation, which helps the local Roma community", says Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
The last place is also occupied by a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of a bonus above the standard.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, skills and leisure", says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition who had completed the questionnaire attached to the registration document and sent it back to the organiser by 15 August were automatically entered in the Responsible Company category.
The organisers withdrew incorrect or incomplete answers from the questionnaire.
'If the representatives of the firms in the competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Firm competition but were not disqualified from the 'main' competition, Vodaphone's Firm of the Year.'
"Independent entries are not possible as this is a sub-category of the Firm of the Year main competition", explains Karel Goldman from the organising agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
Detectives have handcuffed local real estate developer and dealer Lubos.
The Commission had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a refund claim in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific applicant.
He was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider dealing in a public tender and competition", said the head of the Plzen prosecutor's office Antonie Zelena to the Pravo newspaper, knowing that he is not allowed to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
How he could have influenced a public competition can only be speculated about given the limited official information.
When asked by Pravo, Lubomira Cerna, spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public tender.
"This was a customer and not an employee", she said.
The actual name of the public tender according to Cerna is 'Call for proposals for rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act' and is launched when several candidates are presented as rightful beneficiaries.
'These people are proposing, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitution which must be paid before the value of the land is announced.'
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights", explained the Fund spokesman.
Lubos G. clearly had information on the persons who had registered for the call and, as he himself is also a beneficiary, having bought a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably got it by retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money on him when he was arrested.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
It was in the case of former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which a decision to set up a building had already been issued.
Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public transport, for example, on the site where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he traded it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The city council was forced to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardizing the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an extra hundred kroner per month for the accommodation.
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also rise.
From January onwards, families will have to spend up to a hundred kroner more per month than now.
Electricity is up 4.6 percent, gas is almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to bring the annual cost of apartment households to about 100 kroner more than it is now.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices in view of the development of renewable energy production, particularly photovoltaic cells.
Gas is rising moderately but of course at the time when people need it most for heating and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
The main ones planning the price increase are the larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 kroner more per month for central heating from January onwards, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kroner per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, the Prague residents will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the country as a whole.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are rising by 7.4 percent.
The rents will rise significantly in the 450 000 apartments in rental from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase the number of apartments by up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be taken to court by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in almost 300,000 apartments could rise by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fennel, and beer is out of fashion and slow.
The fern, rum, vodka and, exceptionally, also the best brand of whiskey are stolen from the parents.
These are the drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are under fifteen, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for relapses are no exception.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers and wines are out of fashion because it takes time to get drunk".
'The trend is really towards strong alcohol,' says Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at the Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to squeeze a bottle of dad out of the cupboard, it's sometimes whiskey but it's fernet and vodka that prevail".
"The advantage of vodka is that they can mix it with fruit juice and not smell it", says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also agrees.
"It's usually rum or Fernet".
"Alcohol is the new trend, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home", added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, it is normal to see drunk children aged 13 to 14 in hospital.
Before he started working in Horovice last year, he was at Motol where he practiced for ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the surrounding area completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times like this
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with a mixture of ecstasy", the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party".
"What is interesting is that the mother did not find it strange that her daughter was absent for 48 hours", said the Department Director in amazement.
It is the unselfishness of parents or their unusual tolerance of their children's drinking that is the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
However, according to experts, this is not strictly speaking a childhood addiction.
"Alcoholism is a chronic, multi-year addiction to alcohol with all the associated symptoms not found in children".
"In the case of repeat alcohol users, this is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background", explained Pelikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police are not counted.
Besides the cases of children sitting down and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, there are three seasonal waves that Pélikan says can be expected: Witches' Day, New Year's Day and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink in spite of their poor results or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"Of course I had a Witch's Day admission of seven drunk children at once", Pélikan said.
The drunk child who has spent the night in hospital in medical-supervised rehab is paradoxically better off than the one who goes home and has the "wood fever" the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by infusing the body with glucose and nutrients it needs.
"They are better off because they have a good night and then they wake up feeling good and not hurting".
"They are just amazed at where they are", adds Pélikan, knowing that sometimes this spoils the patients' good mood at least with the bill for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care beds can cost up to tens of thousands of kroner.
"I have occasionally used this as an educational tool, telling these children how much their drunkenness cost them and how they could spend the summer working part-time to pay for one evening", Pelikan added.
However, he said, health insurance companies in their regressive approach, which should recover from parents the costs of care, do not treat cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two of the five L-159s, which the Ministry of Defence has traded for Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech Army.
They have, however, been abroad for exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 which were until now in service with the Czech Army and were in flying condition.
The only remaining aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seaters scheduled for exchange were taken from long-stored aircraft without causing additional costs or investment for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The two-seater L-159 T1 has been replaced in the state", said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seaters since the ministry signed a 200 million kroner agreement with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four unused L-159 single-seaters into two-seaters.
The first aircraft was delivered to the army in July, the second is scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS has undertaken to introduce the aircraft into the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159s are being used by EADS for training pilots from NATO countries".
"It is therefore up to the accounting person to determine how this can be achieved", said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not launch a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The Defense Department argued that the exchange ensures future export of the L-159 overseas.
The Czech Army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and uses only 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
The European Commission has, however, brought a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected through a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is due to arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in two weeks.
A longer index finger than the thumb is a sign of low cancer risk
Men with a longer index finger than the ring finger are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British magazine Cancer.
It may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and at the same time almost three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of their right hand shorter than their thumb.
They were found to have the same likelihood of prostate cancer as the 19 percent of those with fingers the same length.
For those with a finger index longer than the ring finger, however, the risk dropped to 33 percent, while for men under 60 the risk decreased to 87 percent.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, the different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
The lower the testosterone, the longer the index.
Previous research had shown that it is testosterone that contributes to the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he was aware of the study but that he did not think the link between finger length and cancer was "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is covered in snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the clearing workers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
At mile 91 a truck was involved in an accident, at mile 93 two trucks collided, the accident left some injured.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometre towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should exit immediately after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometre at Kyvalka.
A line of cars formed for several kilometers at this point.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, just before arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, lines of cars are formed in Prosek, and Sterboholska Street is also congested.
The safest mode of transport is the subway.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the crisis staff in Prague is still meeting.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to cancel 7 rapid transit lines because of the snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Berun have problems.
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11:00 p.m. on Wednesday until 5:00 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already paved but with increased vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impassable, on the Brno road there are beginning to be snowfalls in places and on the Blansko road the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in higher places.
The Vyskov region was one of the worst affected places.
The routes are closed so far: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them up, we may need to send snow plows and snow shovels.
We can't say at this time when they'll be rolling.
On the road to Hodonin, caution is strict in the White Carpathians.
On roads which, for reasons of nature protection, are maintained only by spraying inert products, there is still a 5 cm layer of snow, warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and 10 centimetres of snow fell, with the heaviest snowfall in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow cover in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent to Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known only by the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are laser-guided with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually works like small grenades.
You can program the munitions so that they will explode on contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So it can be used against an enemy hiding behind a barrier, wall, or ditch.
It also has no protection from above, and when a deadly shower of steel shards falls on it, it can be knocked out of the fight as well.
According to Richard Audette who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends a laser beam to it that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise aiming point, according to which he corrects his aim to the site and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires at a distance of 1, 2, 3 meters, or 543 meters", Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg area to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, in July next year the 400-person workplace, which was previously located in Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be moved to Astro Park, a huge office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term the group would add 100 more jobs to the existing ones in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and the open plan offices at Astro Park are more suited to the way the employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was merely a tenant.
The general manager, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of a major company into the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs for the Frankfurt municipality, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global player" had been won.
It is "an extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is a good fit for the city and its establishment is a major boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this enterprise", said Mr Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the building in Marienbader Square.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
The aim is to ensure that such an exceptional site is not left unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the building's owner and landlord will be cooperative".
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, used by Fujitsu until now, and the adjacent "little vertical" along with the rest of the buildings in Marienbad Square were part of the controversial project to build the spa.
A new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall as a joint project of the municipality and a private developer, and was criticized not only for the impressive layout of the areas that had once been partly used for parking but also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer then still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based real estate group Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group considers itself the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it provides computers and servers to businesses and also provides essential services.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, moves from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
The 20-year-old complex, which takes its name from its star-shaped plan, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrical Industry.
Amazon's server ban - threats against Mr Assange
WikiLeaks is having more and more trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the website specialising in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This may be a cover for political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
WikiLeaks founder Mr Assange is apparently in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks website is under increasing attack.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" has lost access to its server hosted in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks is off the Amazon server".
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom", said the cyber activists behind the revelations on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the cyber company Amazon had deleted the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists turned to Amazon Web Service (AWS) to gain access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Great, our dollars are now being spent on taking care of people in Europe".
When freedom of speech is a problem at Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN, citing Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after an investigation by associates of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Land Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British newspaper The Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this step sooner given the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks", the senator said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and ruthless manner, and in doing so, it is endangering our national security and endangering lives around the world", the independent senators said in a statement.
"No company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks to disseminate the content of stolen documents".
WikiLeaks founder Mr Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to reports in London's newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently described the Swedish prosecutions against him as plots orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange".
That is why Assange is particularly worried about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's also why the founder of WikiLeaks is still in hiding.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee has demanded that the man responsible for the WikiLeaks leaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser said on television, apparently ironically, that Mr Assange should be "killed" and that Mr Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy erupted between the White House and Mr Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Mr Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently leaked, to engage in espionage.
"I don't know exactly why we have to care about the opinion of an individual website owner", says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website".
The US government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counterterrorism Center, has been named the new head of the leak control division.
Mr Travers is tasked with implementing "necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the leak of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to investigate the ways in which the entire administration exchanges and protects intelligence.
In addition, the US government has announced that it will provide security for dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to contact them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary".
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream confectionery is made in the best seasons of the year.
The three-day course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where's all the ice coming from?
The Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, or in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine uses a spatula to remove the ice cream from the refrigerated window, place it in the waffle, and then starts selling it.
You do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna to find out.
But anyone who wants to learn more about ice can't help but visit "Gelato-University" by the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the ice cream university in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream produced by its machines everywhere met the high Italian standards.
The three-day course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered over several days, and practical sessions are organised in the private ice cream parlour.
In the midst of the midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, while others simply risk fulfilling their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the future in the land of industrial ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and wants to learn something new from this nerve-wracking job after a few years.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Ice master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Not only does the flavor of the silk matter, but also its softness and consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on top of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romance".
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano poured the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heated everything to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program and then immediately cooled to four degrees.
Then he opens a tap on the machine and takes out a pasteurized white cream base, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
The instructor is immediately confronted with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the age.
The only ice cream that is "made from natural ingredients" may have been a stabilizer, usually a natural product, such as guar seed flour made from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you have to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will have nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes in the basic mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
Master Luciano distinguishes between ingredients that are bought in the fruit and confectionery section of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to stuff you with dozens of flavored ingredients".
"However, you should just try".
Or in the recipes for fruit syrups with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in ice creams made from the white base paste, which, when egg is added, turns to a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka, and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base dough, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is also carried out on the different types of fruit ice cream.
More spices, more fruit purees - from the taste point of view, this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of hazelnut, since it is made mostly of hazelnuts.
The popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture will give a good taste to ice cream", says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
Extra sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (which winemakers use to measure the degree of Ochsle in grape juice).
Fortunately, the tables make it easy to do the calculations.
Ice making no longer requires as much physical intervention as it once did.
It's not just the automatic mass-production machine that's helping.
There is also a machine in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it greasy and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automation, minor failures are not excluded.
Gustavo, a Brazilian, is splashing fruit puree from head to toe on his classmates when he loses control of the giant blender.
Luciano says that "this kind of thing can happen in every classroom. It's just a matter of time".
The Controllers in an Ambiguous Position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has undermined the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're getting it right", said Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
There are reports that the chairman of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper has been instrumental in developing EFSA's testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to Mr Then's criticisms.
The provisions drawn up correspond verbatim, in paragraphs, to the positions of the Ilsi lobby group and thus bear the hallmark of the industry which, in essence, is controlled by the authorities in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior official at EFSA recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without conditions or a transitional period.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal links between the EU supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit that there is any conflict of interest.
One opinion states that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from entering into contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the United States.
The body considers itself to be a neutral forum bringing together experts from the fields of science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being a lobbyist.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the environmental impact of these plants has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize are on the field", says Mr Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the whole plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for risks, how can you find them?" asked Mr. Then, in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the ETH Zurich.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
This is why there are hardly any researchers left who are not linked to societies.
The companies claimed that the critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says that "the industry controls safety research".
The stone trail
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing outside Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a protest.
It was snowing.
The story is familiar: By September, excavators had come and started demolishing much of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was not the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into a multi-billion dollar underground station.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the construction being stopped.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft, rough cobblestone poorly built between 1914 and 1920
Mr Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got some fragments of it.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He enthusiastically declares: "A modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly".
He claims that when he was cutting it with the saw, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with the fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The Stuttgart stone traces lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is a dealer in vintage stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill", he says in his office in a hut that was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the remainder of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained that he couldn't do anything to stop the demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Some 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone para-elepids, weighing on average 80 kilograms and worth between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir, hoping to return it when it is rebuilt.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still piled up in the forest, the rest having been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscapers, private owners.
They came from all over and took everything that could fit in the box and the trailers.
These Stuttgart stumbling blocks have long since become Mäuerle or grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special", says Mr Rongen.
"had it not been for this political component".
He gets in his all-terrain car, goes around his vast, 20-acre empire.
He studied law but later dropped out and began studying biology before turning his attention to computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
It holds 40,000 tons.
He's been amassing treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the world's greatest dealer of ancient stones.
He's holding back.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid out on the snow.
"They used to be part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden".
"Elbsandstein, yellow, hot", he says enthusiastically.
"My favourite stone".
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on and so forth.
"Beautiful travertine".
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
All over the snow of stones and stories, Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, reddish granite from St. Blaise's Cathedral, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What a job, what a struggle, what a sweat.
When Mr Rongen remembers that in the past the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple pallets and ox-drawn carts, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a legacy were to be destroyed".
He didn't get rich, much less very rich.
In addition, stonecutters, a carpenter, a blacksmith, a glassblower, and a gardener have moved into the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding", says the recycler.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be saved there too.
The struggle of talents to win over high potential
The counter is packed.
16 students are scrambling to buy salmon sandwiches, tomato sauce and white food.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen company.
Many companies today are willing to go head-to-head in the competition to find the best minds and, like Volkswagen, to engage in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates to the amphitheatres before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements of student achievement, they try to identify and retain exceptional talent through practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group was taming the talent.
A young woman in the personnel department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo on them.
She gives the young talents the timetable for vocational training and student jobs and shows them the way to the group.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
He believes there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience".
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as collaborators".
According to Mr. Seale, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we try to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was on the professional project", says Selle.
The struggle to win over the new graduates will become much more intense.
In certain sectors, companies can no longer recruit employees by sorting them through a list of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all, court highly skilled labour.
It is mainly graduates from engineering courses who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineer positions were left unfilled in October.
The VDI forecasts that the vacancy in engineering jobs will increase further.
Roman Dykta is a talent scout for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent-recruiting events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way around using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students to travel around the United States next year.
Participants can visit KPMG's subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The candidates are selected in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the crop of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used to attract high potential students to universities are becoming increasingly important.
"We want to stand out from the crowd through cruise racing".
"A cruise was too little for us"
For the talent scout Mr. Dykta, it seems to be the end of the line.
"To this day we have kept in touch with all those who took part in a similar action last year".
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and would like to send their applications to our company soon", he says.
Apart from the direct softening of the campus, SMEs are doing the usual thing by participating in trade fairs where they are brainwashed.
"We try to reach graduates by attending trade fairs".
"For example, at the solar technology fair", says Sitha Stübe, human resources manager at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company, based in Bonn, employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the succession problem.
Currently, 35 positions are being advertised on the company's website.
"It is very difficult to fill vacancies at the moment".
"It's expensive and time-consuming", he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the University of Freiburg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of doing a vocational placement or writing his final project at our school".
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised by solar-power companies.
That is why the company tries to advertise itself by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group cannot do this", says Ms Stübe, head of staff.
Money has long ceased to be the main factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other determining factors.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honorary list of German employers.
To this end, it surveys employees on their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the employees' general conditions.
The head of the staff, Mrs Stübe, hopes that this placement will help to raise the company's image among jobseekers.
"I think that candidates rely mostly on external evaluations of a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means above all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make himself attractive is through his own employees", he says.
This is called, in industry jargon, internal image strategy, i.e. creating the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Happiness is the best messenger".
When employees are treated well and identify with the company, they are able to advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra", says Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeastern United States, in the years ahead.
The Washington government has issued a ban, an equivalent ban, and thus permanently cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig in April is the reason for this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of the accident, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, indicated that he was willing to authorize further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in the Gulf has not been definitively resolved to this day.
The British oil company, which is facing multi-billion dollar compensation claims, is at the center of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze imposed after the rig explosion.
Following this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing a thorough reform.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of oil and gas companies.
The sector is now publicly warning that the flow of food into the Gulf would be much lower than it has been so far.
"The government's aim is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector", according to a current survey of the sector by the BDO audit firm, ahead of Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance laments the uncertainty of the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation".
Investments in new support projects have been deferred until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water in the rivers is oily brown, and it smells like a gas station. Billions of gallons of crude oil leaked into the Ogoni country of Nigeria.
People live off theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't get tired", the environmentalist tells reporters to calm them down. "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens".
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man in muddy water up to his chest and the greasy streak around him.
You can't tell the basement is full of brown layers of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that she used to collect shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have dried up completely.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil gushed out of an oil pipeline that exploded into the huge swamp.
Fishermen in the small town of Bodo, nearby, now have to row for six hours to reach the fish-rich waters.
The extent of the damage is obvious when you walk through the mangrove swamps and streams.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat splits a sparkling brown water, and anyone who dips his hand in it comes out covered in oil.
Young mangrove roots emerge from the ground like lily sticks, and isolated palm trees leave their palms sadly hanging.
The search for bird clouds, as is common in wetlands, is in vain. As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls over this ancient paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment", says Celestine Akpobari, with a sad face. "Our lives are marked by a constant danger to health".
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live has been a battleground for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. he was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the company is forbidden to return to Ogoni country: While over 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields in Ogoni country are untapped because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred yards, steel treads rise up in the water like strange sculptures.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them are rotted to the bone.
Akpobari believes that a well of this type occasionally breaks into pieces because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, over two billion liters have been spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years - an amount of oil equivalent each year to that spilled into the sea when the supertanker Exxon Valdez crashed off the coast of Alaska 21 years ago, one of the worst environmental disasters in human history.
Who is to blame for persistent environmental pollution?
Shell Group blames oil pipeline sabotage and seepage for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists say exploding wellheads and drilling pipelines are the main causes.
In 2008, US researcher Richard Steiner criticized Shell for applying much lower safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world.
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop full of mangroves set outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with mangroves up to their necks.
A fire is glowing under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered without a pattern on the site to be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
First, the gasoline enters a tank through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the kerosene drops fall and finally diesel is produced.
Thus, Michael and his four coworkers produce four 300-liter barrels of diesel every day: "That's N34,000", about $22 (U.S.).
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a lower price than the ridiculously low 40 cents a litre of diesel: because they get their raw material for free.
The oil is being offered by the "protectors" who are breaking the pipeline network throughout Ogoni country, which experts say is causing the country to lose at least 16 million litres of crude oil across the Niger Delta.
Only a very small fraction of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military officers, load the lion's share into tankers and sell it on the world market.
Akpobari believes that the debate on whether the environmental disaster or the subversive activities should be attributed to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the fishermen's livelihoods were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries".
But in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations with Shell in particular had deteriorated to such an extent that the only thing left to do was to withdraw from the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove better".
So Michael is getting nervous.
"It's time for you to get out of here", says the tough oilman.
"The soldiers may appear at any time".
If the illegal refiners are caught by the special forces, they will not be arrested, but at most they will be offered bribes.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, want to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In every way, this damn thing has brought our country down", Akpori laments.
Investigators discover design flaws in A380's reactors
The A380 is obviously suffering from a major safety problem.
In examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible design defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure".
Qantas now wants to sue the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, passengers on the Airbus of the Quantas airline had apparently been more fortunate: During its investigation, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the engines of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and warned of a possible design defect.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It can cause fatigue creeks and leaks in the oil pipe connection, according to a position statement published on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic reactor failure".
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November, was among them.
The Australian airline has now taken the British jet manufacturer to court.
She filed a legal complaint with the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney, which gave her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas's CEO, Mr Alan Joyce, said his company would seek damages for the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts came off and the load-bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
Rolls-Royce says the oil ignition is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors around the world now have to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem is considered to be sufficiently serious to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing, the airline Quantas grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the jet engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker plane is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes traffic chaos
Germany covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are stopped.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Germany's cold winter: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic was covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service worked around the clock, but they could not cope with the snow that kept piling up.
In addition, violent winds swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow on motorways and federal roads has caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather station Meteomedia has announced the violet alert level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In some places, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell, which the strong, cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported serious disruptions on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a disruption of traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the railway tracks, fallen trees on the railway tracks, broken catenaries or needles.
In Saxony, inter-regional transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to stop.
Firefighters and paramedics had to provide blankets, food, and drink for all 165 passengers on the train.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfall has caused many flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the airline, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesperson said that 40 flights had already been cancelled to Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the number of passengers stuck at the airport has decreased, but only 400 beds are available.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In Ostholstein, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the snow cover on the roads, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg. Even here a truck was hit by a level crossing because the vehicle was stopped.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled over a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: While the snow will still be soft and powdery, it will swirl if there are light winds.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong, fast winds.
However, it is very cold, down to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is looking to divest itself of its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautified the group's headquarters: the twin towers in the Business District have been modernised; meanwhile, bankers have had to return to their former workplaces.
The financial group is now apparently seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper quoted a spokesman as saying.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
He said: 'We are looking at whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them and rent them again at a later date.'
The largest financial institution in Germany has already ceded its headquarters shortly afterwards.
It was not until mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for EUR 272 million from equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The cost of energy efficiency improvements is estimated at some EUR 200 million.
Of course, a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in the sector estimate the value of the towers, now renamed 'Green Towers', at around EUR 500 million.
According to the spokesman, it is currently unknown whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been thinking about the buried miners who were declared dead in several mine explosions.
The bodies had not yet been removed because the safety situation at the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe was inserted into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors was found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend to the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent explosion, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had no chance of survival.
So far, the bodies have been unable to be recovered.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a party in memory of the deceased.
Thousands of people had gathered under the blazing sun in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were set up on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal belongings, including clothes and surfboards, were also included.
Flags were hoisted in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the memorial that New Zealand had hoped the miners would come to the surface.
"But they never came home".
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the graves, said he cannot be resigned to accepting his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial celebration.
South African and British miners were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers have started to extinguish a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film a fake film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", a fighter epic.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When in a bad mood, he rips out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, the boy does not say a word about his real name until the end of the film, and even the other characters let out, at most, a few terrible cries of agony in a sentence or two.
Otherwise, you're just sitting there and partying in the incredibly beautiful Scottish mountains that formed the backdrop of the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and great travel.
When a film is aimed at several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded, ever since the release of Pusher, his stylish, fierce drug-dealer trilogy, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality into experimental art cinema.
Most fans of the art film must be horrified by the brain that spreads all around and into the intestines.
Action movie buffs are bored to death when the ship is boarded, for reasons that can be readily explained, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem, and they are drowned for an eternity in the calm and fog before the crew reaches America and continues in silence.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any film distributors in Germany and exists only in DVD format.
This is mainly because of the beautiful images of poverty that have been given some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film is sometimes hidden behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
There's no dialogue in this movie, no coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a movie.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment's relaxation and slowly slices his throat with chilling images and a grim soundtrack, but most of all with an elusive hatred that springs from the characters' hearts.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the burgundy, retains some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
Most of all, the unlikely hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any moment to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents rot, but maybe also, just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, intended to annoy, excite and astonish.
It was a traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information about a nuclear program being developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on the matter, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
In the night of September 5-6, 2007 at around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the Euphrates River, and the nearest major city is Dair as-Sur, some 20 miles [30 km] away.
His name is in the IAEA documents because it is about the reactor that Syria built, apparently with the help of North Korea, in a stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing by the US intelligence services, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town, el-Kibar, is well suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to make atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation that included blurry satellite imagery.
Using computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the plant was destroyed, which is a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
She also showed photos of the building nearby, and even inside.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is little more information available than then, and even more so as time goes on.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, and so does the IAEA.
When asked how he ensures that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a brief answer in the summer, saying that the IAEA had "enough documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly hurriedly removed the rubble from the "unused military building" and systematically leveled the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers showing the time immediately following the attack from a Member State. These appear to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always maintained that it has never carried out a secret nuclear programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site came from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA dismissed this argument after analyzing the particles as unreliable.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as the satellite images.
In addition, Syria is not allowing inspectors to conduct a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and is refusing access to the debris of the bombed building.
But even Israel is stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then acting Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this".
The investigation into the matter has dragged on since June 2008 without a result and "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility for the Agency", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits.
The IAEA considers that progress requires clarification of the existence of the other three facilities which must have a 'functional relationship' with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not said what facilities are here, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to reports published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah respectively, also after the names of the nearby towns.
The Washington-based independent Institute for Science and International Security identified these sites and found satellite images of a complex near Masyaf that is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly adjacent to it, which is exactly why Syria is denying IAEA inspectors access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection team is actually spies sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by U.S. intelligence agencies that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been shuttled between the three sites and the stone parapet to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "be used for fuel production".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly runs on unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses about the following fundamental questions: where should the uranium have come from and where would the plutonium needed to make the bomb have been separated later?
It is not known whether the debris, which may hide valuable traces, was stored at the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt are gone, no one will have information about where the debris is being stored.
The IAEA believes that it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar, across the Euphrates, inspected in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of satellite photos for the popular magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
However, satellite photos show that Syria began earthworks at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It is possible that this was a coincidence, but it did not help dispel the suspicions.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, which are in line with the Commission's proposals, and the Council has also taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
For example, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the reactor's destruction a year ago, the emergency would not have been reported, says Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been talking for months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Energy Agency has to implement its controls.
The IAEA director, Yukiya Amano, who proposed the inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This approach carries a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a good number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
And then, like that diplomat who makes you think, "What's the point if they don't get anything at the end?"
Love in a Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut last summer.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman of Bosnian origin and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything else about this story, but that's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor is that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some of the filming scheduled for Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to reports in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war wrote to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet with the actress, who is herself a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she offered to meet with these women in Hungary, but they declined.
"The meeting should be held in Bosnia", says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees withdraw Angelina Jolie's status as a goodwill ambassador.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, granted after some hesitation a filming permit in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not come afterwards despite this permission.
The young author herself says that she is not pursuing political goals with her film, that it was a lot of effort that brought her to know about the Yugoslav conflict.
However, it remains vague as to the content.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the net, which is quite different: the lovers knew each other long before the war began, but they meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference from the version of "a rape victim falls in love with her executioner".
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now only Hollywood fanatics can bring her peace by illegally posting this script on the Internet, as many others have done before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, the Irish are doing well again.
No sign of dismay.
That is why the local team is overwhelmingly dominant over visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are shouting for joy to loud music, they're stamping their feet.
Baileyu-Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is vibrant because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls from a distance of 10 feet into the opposing team's beer glasses.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong", and the winner gets 500 euros plus a plane ticket to attend the world beer-pong championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to turn his back on the big question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of gambling in Las Vegas is not part of his plans.
"I have a strange feeling, though", he says.
"My home country is so far away and I have no job".
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two hours, she got her dream job as an event planner, maybe a good sign", he says with a smile.
Due to the bleak prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young People Go: The situation of most families on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts at the Institute for Economic and Social Research say that 100,000 Irish will soon be leaving their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are to be fulfilled, this will be a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great prosperity, grief now takes over.
The economic crisis, however, has particularly affected the well-educated young people of Ireland, who have so far had only happy moments.
The loss of jobs and the social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everybody had a job, there's money in the bank.
But in the meantime, three out of every ten people under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has a wealth of letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything is drifting in Ireland".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the means, leaves and so does our country for a generation".
"The last one to leave turns off the light".
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future ahead because the government is just throwing dust in the eyes and offering no prospect of a future for young people.
"They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her classmates clinging from one unpaid internship to another.
She says her biggest worry is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought".
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organises the 'WorkingAbroadExpo' trade fair which provides comprehensive support on the theme of 'working abroad'.
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to the profession to take their first steps up the career ladder", says the official.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a hassle, but it also guarantees freedom and happiness.
For the last six months, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to be based elsewhere.
With nothing left to do in Ireland for the 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house is just getting started in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he takes on an extra job to pay off the loan to build his home country.
"It's a little crazy already", he says as he steps out of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore".
He bursts out laughing embarrassed as he walks through the cold rooms.
The little house is in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of big brands parked on the driveways.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house with his sister for $380,000, financed 100 percent on credit.
"Those were crazy times, no doubt, money was easy", he says.
Is he afraid that everything will fall apart because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, sips hot tea, and says: "I have no children to support and I am young; even if something goes wrong, I can start over".
The building engineer doesn't like the complaints he's heard often lately.
"No one should go hungry, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps it is what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and in Ireland, life just kept going".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Leave the future and find out how life is elsewhere.
In his record, he has already worked a few years in London, which is why life in New Zealand must not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one thing that has been worrying her a lot these last few days: the party she's having for her 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's worried it might turn into a going-away party.
"Only not much emotion", he said, taking a long sip of beer.
"Goodbye, it sounds like a worrying thing to do".
"Let's call it a goodbye party, all relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks and a few games".
The routine of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro survey of 18 countries, published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific Rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has fallen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which is lower than the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy in their country was functioning in practice, the same as last year but a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases, but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (17 and 24%, respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shaken support for democracy.
The fact that this has held up during the global financial crisis is certainly because many countries in the Americas have experienced a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security system has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32 percent.)
But moods vary considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress.
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has increased.
For only the second time since the survey began, more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Some 31% say they or a loved one has been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58 percent believe that a market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47 percent last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (down from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Dirty Vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country in disaster and fear.
There were ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballots scattered in the gutters, polling stations ransacked and intimidation
The polling stations were open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood looking for places to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed favorites, denounced fraud and called for the election to be called off.
Protests, sometimes violent, broke out across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations' top official in Haiti, considers the event "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular incumbent president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, withdrew their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr Celestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and over 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was concern that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, which are needed to vote, were still not distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, obviously, Haitians do it themselves.
The toes towards the centre
In the weeks after becoming a sudden widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that has increased her approval rating by 20 points to over 50 percent, her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet whether this turns into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, whether or not she abandons the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, speaking of which, the signs are still confusing.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was accustomed to drafting budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income as they pleased.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement have joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one MP slapped one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more leeway to spend as he pleases.
The economy is overheating, and is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage claims put the figure at close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit the pay rise next year to 18 percent.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not paid its due in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which is a prelude to the restructuring of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If she does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is very much promoted.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she'll have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half an hour to China.
Taiwanese voters have been moving towards a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, or 70 percent of eligible voters, turned out on November 27 to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, in what is considered a general assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the mainland, having forged innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganisation of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five city halls, he failed to win a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned towards full Taiwan independence, won almost 50% of all votes for the KMT's 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main themes of Taiwan's election, including noisy campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mysterious forced assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, conducted a voting tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter intended to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, the candidates have been toying with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid flaunting its ties to the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stoking anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is a response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It is to be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilitation in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would also like to see political integration, but let us start at the beginning.
Better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, it was in trouble when its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Tsai's leadership and the PDP is doing its best to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do some introspection.
Mr. Ma's ratings were low; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
The unpopularity of the magazine seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says his office and local offices will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to prominent columnist Antonio Chiang, "the point of no return has already passed".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selection in the "best new artist" category
Performed at the request of a president, and the people are required to be aware of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the biggest surprises at this year's Grammy Awards with a major nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure in the jazz scene since her 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but is consistent with Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; this "establishes the public identity of that artist".
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward, and given her slightly engaging vocal style, her skillful hand of pop and funk and her Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line in Spalding's comparison to the meteoric success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters when taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a departure from the refreshing thrill of a recording that was a top favorite last year.
Among the Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite with a raucous voice from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the Contemporary Jazz category; which also leans heavily toward a sure fusion with albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved accolades in the big ensemble category; competing with the rich chamber jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" from his octet's live was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
Top nominations included "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yeses"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yeses".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and opened at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in the running for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for classic producer of the year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from the Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are up for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, which lasts about 30 minutes, is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern sounds and a lot of North African scales and rhythms", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received nominations were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominated solo vocalists; they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording of "Roots: My Life, My Song".
The Temecula Mosque project wins approval from the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning commission after more than five hours of often enthusiastic public witnessing.
Critics have attacked the project, claiming that it promotes both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you name it", said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen".
"It shows that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal", he added.
"They just have very loud voices".
"We have good people in this valley".
The hearing began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with most of the time people speaking for or against the center, with speaking time roughly evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America", wrote one speaker.
"It's another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families has coexisted without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property she shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque in Mediterranean architecture would consist of two minarets and rise 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectare site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal this project to the city council.
A microbe that tolerates arsenic raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has double capacity".
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic".
"That's why it's so special, even though it's far from a truly 'alien' life form", said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue growing after replacing the phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what else is possible", said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss the find, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It was not.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we believe are absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed", said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the search team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", Cockell added.
It wasn't a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute for one.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, the organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately".
"But arsenic is different enough that it does not work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, gums the work of our biochemical machine", Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which allowed it to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new, but there was no evidence that it could work.
Arsenic was more common in the early days of Earth's existence, she says, so researchers have hypothesized that early life forms may have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first", said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton.
The other two dogs from four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis - went missing on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van they had spent the night in outside a motel 6 in Bellflower, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told the Associated Press.
"The good news is the dogs are fine", says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape".
"They have been returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood, and under what circumstances.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say it", Whitmore said.
"We follow orders".
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited with their two Akitas on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Deputy found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - three-year-old male Trace and 10-month-old female Didi - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek were planning to show at a regional dog show this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until they were found Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend for the Long Beach AKC/Eukanuba National Championship, where they were supposed to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly month-long dog show tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans outside, right by their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Breton Spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the thicker-furred corgis in the truck where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they'd offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It's unclear if any reward was awarded Thursday.
The lion is ready to roar again, MGM restructuring just waiting for final green light from the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially praised on Thursday the creditors' "pre-packaged" plan to cancel about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on film and television production and distribution.
With Thursday's ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no legal barriers left for MGM to float back under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a slim studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 from 400 initially.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has closed a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM's new operations and production.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which is itself facing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to invest its finances as it could not afford to pay the interest of $300 million per year.
In August, the CEO, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to sell the company.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, and none of them were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done over again as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debate, was finally approved by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerged from bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their business management services, will receive a $4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to revive production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on The Hobbit, with Warner Bros.
The studio must take out a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the major shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the top contender for the most wonderful toy of the year is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, the Kinect, both can make a big dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 traditional pearl jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see which electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
Clearly Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to be more powerful; while still costing the same if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more to offer.
And button-battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable toys.
Here are some suggestions.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for ages 3 and up) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when pressed on their belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second is equal to a song.
If you buy several, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For singing and dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for ages 2 and up) is the best choice.
Building on technology from last year's Elmo Live, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do the moon dance with its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
The children who tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you'll remember Alfie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for ages 3 and up), with a backpack filled with questionnaire playing cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with self-correction and a valve filler.
If you're suspicious when your child holds their smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo ($60, for ages 3-8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for ages 3-12), it is the first major revision of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30 Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out, which is ideal for an impromptu spelling bee.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for ages 6 to 12) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It could be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair on the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button battery micro-robot.
The fake bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pads in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also solid.
Our dog survived a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary pass in our dog's mouth.
Bringing a Softer Side to Law Enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin walked through a city square like a city sergeant in training, scrutinizing his nerve charges, giving orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he says, "what pretty girls look like".
Four girls in white gloves, identical olive-colored jackets and pants, just past their teenage years, were standing on guard duty.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four neat hats perched perfectly on top of hair tied in a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they look average", said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty".
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required that all new recruits have a college degree.
The province of Guangdong has replaced the gray-green uniforms with a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, central China, has replaced the eye-rolling with the strong way: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart with black eyelashes, firmly for half an hour, until the mailman packed up and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, chose to do a big image operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially selected for their appearance, their complexion and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have trouble getting attention for this underground urban brigade from China.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news in a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat a spectator to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing detectives was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively defeat criminals without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, shows Chinese detectives trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a mark on the government", lamented China Daily, a national publication, after another controversy over tactics last year.
The paper called for a "true and complete cleanup".
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district announced in October that it was looking for eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real jobs or were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's advertisement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful figure and "the five facial features in the correct order".
They must be above average height, or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at 26 is compulsory.
The officers said the work was too physically demanding for women over 25.
"It's their image that matters", a district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine their suitability - height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there are temperament and "inner qualities".
Chengguan women are like flower pots, he said, adding: "In addition to being pots, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial features.
What that means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured persons do not have to apply.
"We cannot allow a lame or a hunchback to come here to serve", says Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't look good".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has a cheek patch with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn't consider the highlighting of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a disillusioned look.
Xu Yang, a 21-year-old colleague at the pits, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city".
They said they were not opposed to having their terms limited because they had higher career ambitions than simply driving the vendors out into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many loaves or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave".
"We've told you many times before!" said Ms. Xu as one vendor fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-loaded noodle cart.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
"It's about the same thing every day", said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine".
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to seize the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, revolted after false rumors spread that Chengguan agents had killed a vendor.
In one night, more than a dozen police and Chengguan agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But there is little guarantee of peace.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where the female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a shop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming at the scene.
A 15-minute brawl ensued before the police, with their grim faces, elbowed their way to their vehicle and ran off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge flipped over to hide his name.
Like female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a clean image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts".
The prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have dropped criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case involving a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The ruling ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said it was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be subject to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign is no longer under investigation and that it does not intend to pursue any charges against him in this matter".
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the matter.
The announcement came as a bit of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first released in October 2009 in The New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain a lucrative lobbying job to silence Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an associate of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law for one year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called revolving door ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that has been released, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and a substantial violation of the revolving door law", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the Ensign decision, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-profile setbacks by its public integrity section, including a decision last year to drop charges against former Sen. Ted Stevens on charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws do not apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up the next day, telling him the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's legal team had cooperated with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to elaborate on the legal arguments he made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, alleging that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove the money was anything but a gift.
Energy NV, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work for.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Department of the Interior on a contentious issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign announced two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would soon follow the lead of the Justice Department and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter.
About half a dozen of them were tapping away in the rows of the courtroom.
They were sending out reports of horrific testimonies every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were over 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end with the judge imposing the death penalty, voted on by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court outlining appeal arguments that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - along with the widespread and widespread use of Twitter by journalists - created a "circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial, and I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technology into the courtroom is a violation of the right to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, attorney for Hayes, chief counsel.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the state's Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week's ruling, saying the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was motivated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the final word on the matter.
The courts of appeals have recognized for decades that media coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland osteopath Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts appealed to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage courtroom communications, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" on large-scale lawsuits, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says that some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years, delaying execution.
The defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes was harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of crime scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and abused the pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to have the jury deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial may be the most interesting.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media was constantly fueling the flames of emotion in the case.
"The daily jumble of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse", the lawyers wrote, "was unlike anything seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide".
Their emphasis on Twitter's coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that instant news was more inflammatory than slow-moving news was a Luddite view that would undermine the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on that claim.
In their case, they refer to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and they made it clear that they would argue the need for new rules for new media.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century".
Can civility bridge the gaps?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of real bipartisan cooperation going forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that must be addressed during the lame duck session.
But obviously, at least there was a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the chairman's deficit committee was just as civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide, but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a period of testing and testing each other for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for renewed guerrilla warfare.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed in the last two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, health care, or rights, the two parties stay miles apart.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no doubt that things have changed in tone", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now with the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade away.
That's good".
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to appear to be in favour of tax cuts for the rich while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, more optimism is looming over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the lame duck session, with the ratification of the New START pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the lame duck session may not prevent better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations", he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing in relation to the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters at the tea that helped create it.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of going too far, they know they have to try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their view, placed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, which has 18 members, to make their plan an official recommendation, and they've had a hard time getting that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there is little motive or willingness to compromise on tax matters, at least for the time being.
Galston foresees two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will watch the public reaction carefully.
The one who loses must change course and compromise.
But that would still be an optimistic view.
Partisan sentiment and polarization is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as merely a prelude to a larger election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility on display this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is now under the control of a "Kleptocracy" and some of the bribes and protection money it collects is being funneled to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized crime groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "power vertical" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he is largely blamed for the corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little evidence of cleanup since then.
Lukhkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied the corruption charges over the years, and he has won several defamation lawsuits over those charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing away, it's nonsense".
The overwhelming majority of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in an embassy report, and it is unusual to think that diplomats from a foreign country would do it.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government", according to the embassy note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"The FSB, MVD and militias are on the second level".
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level".
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal gangs fill a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services".
The report says the FSB is laundering money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting the smaller ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than from organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law".
"That is why the demand for protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high".
The note notes that although the collection of money is widespread, the protection itself can be uneven, and even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who delay in paying are closing their businesses under some pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy note reports of men bringing suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats", said Gueorgui Satarov, director of the Moscow-based think tank Indem, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"He is not part of a political class because there is no such thing in Russia".
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the costs of corruption in Russia as a whole are estimated at over $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked as least corrupt and most corrupt).
The leak of the US embassy note, which was only made late yesterday evening Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is working on the problem.
In an interview with CNN's Larry King, Putin speculated that the WikiLeaks documents might be a fabrication and reacted angrily to comments by US diplomats who had leaked him calling him Batman and likening Medvedev to Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in the domestic politics of this country", he says.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, against ethics".
Former Khmer Rouge fighters confronted with their past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality, decrepit concrete walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School spoke of the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people", said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality when he was the leader of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of the former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, run jointly with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing to 35 years in prison the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
This has caused growing anxiety among former Khmer Rouge fighters in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"The situation is creating divisions in families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched a rebellion that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect from the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood his ground, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their supporters, most of the Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into the black poverty that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are still nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, they are unskilled farmers with low rank and record.
"These people have received very little follow-up after the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They were raised in an environment where doing business is a foreign concept".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone".
But now life is hard because we have to provide for ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to try senior officials and those most responsible for the crimes but it did not say whether it would prosecute beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has been about Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there are more lawsuits, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned repeatedly that instability would occur if the court prosecuted multiple suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces", he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand".
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", consisting of 75 pages.
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Vale Touchak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court", he says.
"They're wary because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a pathway, covered with weeds and covered with plastic bags, leads to a black soot-covered rectangle with a rusty metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cellphone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the site.
"But he has a great spirit, and many locals go there to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's final resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component of nuclear weapons, in a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was leaked in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to clear the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were conducted with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the roughly 500-pound material, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, which was organized at the initiative of Obama, and which excluded Belarus.
It seems that it was profitable to send invitations to the former Soviet republic after the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This proves to me that this process works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low-enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our product... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're just going to use it for research purposes".
Belarus has been close to the United States for a few months, however, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia for storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was conducted by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium, unsuitable for weapons.
"There was careful coordination and organization to build trust", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus aims to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential resurgence.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens", she said.
The government has made no objection to the CIA's thefts.
The government has made no objection to the CIA flights of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo via Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. Embassy in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the first Vice President of the Government at the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed so that "it can demonstrate that they were exercising adequate surveillance over foreign aircraft that were flying through Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accused a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council report had "taken the Zapatero government by surprise out of the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "caught off guard", Aguirre said in a cable.
The then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to keep this case as low profile as possible, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense documents on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating material, no sensitive information", the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern over "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information from CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba commented that "even though the Spanish judges are insanely jealous of his independence and will do what they see fit", he had instructed his staff "to avoid comments of inflammatory rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-US orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has condoned or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the US government", she said.
The confessed parricide complained online about the "burden" of being a mother.
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she comes.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know about his love life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, it was discovered that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of his messages, you can tell that their idol has broken, they've split up.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset that I came to work there".
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants".
And then she tells of a cell phone message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the baby".
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, he can leave the boy with my mother, and I'll pick him up when I get home", she says.
In May she said of her return to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a work station so as not to lose it".
She said if everything was fine, she would have taken her oldest son with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him of my life with another person if that person is not my mother", doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another job.

People's Party members would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in the number of votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party obtains in these commissions is normally twice that it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP won 384,091 votes.
If the upward trend, which is aimed at diverting votes from the PSC and gaining the loyalty of the PP, is maintained, the analysts of this formation have calculated that if there are general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 members in the Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more nor less than 9 members (it has 25).
These calculations would show that Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or gain one.
But if the electoral agenda holds, the next meeting would be in May 2011 for the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in ending the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the Nationalists and the Populars agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get a majority nor the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful if this party lost its representation in Barcelona's city council - it needs to get 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased its vote in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded a difference of only 500 votes against PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign they met several times.
The popular movement has also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 local governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many localities as possible.
Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by officers from the Barcelona Police Information Directorate were a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laskar e Taiba (LTE), the latter being responsible for the 2008 bombings in Mumbai that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of making sure that with 'Operation Kampai' the Al Qaeda's international counterfeiting apparatus and 'therefore its operational capacity' has been 'weakened'.
Investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to groups that were part of the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "fighters" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network has operated in Europe, which is why, apart from the Thai police, other European police units have also been involved in the investigations, which is why there could be similar attacks in the European Union in the following days to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the arrest of Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who ran the cell in Bangkok, which was in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was struck in 2009 - was mainly stealing passports from tourists that met the conditions set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents had to be in the name of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators say that so far no details have been found linking the detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator, Laskar e Taiba, was one of the groups that received the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth remembering that a few days before the attack, a few thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a money transfer agency, which were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend fiscal complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those presented during the campaign and which simply focus on prioritizing the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignty adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address in the middle of his term.
The chairwoman of the Catalan Popular Party arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty of having won 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be liked, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the opposition parties abstain in the vote on the inauguration.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And as for the PP chairwoman, to support an inauguration "all sovereigntist and independence discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have a common goal of reducing the political apparatus to a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and eliminating the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiation on Mas's appointment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of Olot Centre do not rule out the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric hospital La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his time there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the big threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was in August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality was done by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this yesterday and mentioned that "lack of measures could not have been the cause of what happened at any time".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only one indication of recklessness on the part of anyone other than the accused".
The person already dubbed "the Angel of Death" admitted 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting her with an overdose of insulin, unlike his first crime with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the center to the medicines.
Insulin injections and a sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine murders that the nurse used to kill the inmates in an attempt to relieve their suffering.
But lab tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying when he says he sought a less cruel death for his first victims or instead he burned them inside by giving them laundry like he already confessed he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
Caritat does not believe the night nurse's statements, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not rule out the possibility that the number is higher and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain available to the judiciary to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "the markets must not underestimate our ability to react".
The differentials in the peripherals closed strongly and the shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes either and the euro has barely increased, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which, in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but driven by closing short and highly speculative positions.
It's not going to take long for the institutional investor to lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures with a forward rate and only unlimited access to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures 'at least until March' and maintain the quarterly unlimited access auction at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that even the signal will be given to intensify it.
If they do not live up to the expectations they have generated, they will reverse the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blindly to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as at their May meeting when they said they hadn't even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing another market crash.
Yesterday the auction of one-year-old pigs in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Even so, the rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland holes have been published.
The estimated figures are 10 billion in the short term and 15 billion in the potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are acceptable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday the Government will have to get Parliament's approval for its new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, at which a political compromise must be found that shows that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment ring in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains why the Spanish stock market fell by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical and we are taking advantage of the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond which will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve itself with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
To ask Spain for a relief plan would be self-immolation.
They'd give us a line of cash that we don't need, the Treasury has over $40 billion in cash available, triple what it had in March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "aside from being, the appearance".
Take heart, we can get through this!
The president of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicilia council requested by his sons
The storm continues in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge, as he considers it "null of rights", the judicial council of El Enebro on the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter in their dispute over control of a portion of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services for companies does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present on the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from the board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, the objection of which is registered in the Commercial and Companies Register.
The El Enebro court for the next 16 days, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened the thunderbox again in the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to set the meeting is, until the dispute is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal by the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a procedural cleverness, clearly fraudulently violating the law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the contestation of the assembly as "null and void" once it takes place.
The same protagonists, who are quietly keeping quiet, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company that owns Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless asks for 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the issue of substance which the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this elite world of speed has been one of surprise and success.
At first, no one considered the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without diminishing the driving skills of the German champion, Sebastian Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we are talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high-level automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly lines for manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, simulate accurately the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "within a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and testing.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now has 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and design all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all the elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are modified.
Changes can be made from simulator to virtual reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological improvement is the amount of $40 million that each Formula One team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town 30 miles outside London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens in there is classified.
The staff for this task is 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula One, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and notoriety zero.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that progress in R&D in the case of racing cars was responsible for 50 percent of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 own stores with local distributors in two years.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of a network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to set up in Spain over the next two years.
The company will include this initiative in the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the refurbished store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to set up 200 branded retail outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish outlets.
The first open was held in Bucharest, Romania, and Belgrade, Serbia, last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero declined to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The head of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the location of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and designs the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops was intended to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, support, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering global pilot programme that addresses potential problems with HP's warranty IT equipment.
An online service connecting to a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"In this way, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days".
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services", Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell betting on stealing a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially compensated by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers within three years, a task it must complete.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The aim, apart from surviving without the need for FROB's public subsidies, is to gain market share by attracting one million new retail customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its big task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 corporate customers.
Its market share among individuals is 3.5%, while it is over 10% among companies.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the financial year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, since the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for another year.
Clients who let the savings banks slip will be his primary target.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
He also stressed that in two or three years' time it would be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the banking business.
And even if he thinks the war on liabilities - which is penalizing margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premia that banks and savings banks pay for its issues to get liquidity is already moving up the price of credit to offset the fall in margins.
'The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor of credit pressure.'
"We haven't turned the tap on, but the differentials are higher", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already ordered its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive environment".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures us that in Spain "larger dimensions will be required".
"Everything will change next year", he assured.
He says that capital requirements are "increasing enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could be in the red.
It also mentions that the FROB can replace the market in raising funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed the fact that some bankers are already predicting another liquidity crisis.
He points out that it is not possible to issue, but unlike in June, short-term financing can be obtained through a break, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
The ECSC's Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and reiterated the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the merger process of the Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
'I think most of the mergers have been completed, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments.'
"Most of it has been completed completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too", the manager stressed.
Speaking at a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said the merger process was taking place "as quickly as possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is happening within the time limits we have set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasised.
"The move from 45 funds with an average of 28.5 billion in assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is a trial unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slow pace of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense" because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we must meet the deadline before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and 'probably' the world and blamed those who questioned it on a 'lack of knowledge'.
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a "very important" concentration process and "is moving at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had recovered well from the stress tests that the ECB had carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have led to a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment measures, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro unemployment benefit without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined in criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How are these movements to be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro, with Austria, Holland and other countries, and the south leaving the eurozone.
The second is the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable opinion, almost 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a new design of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines for countries that break them, possible suspensions of payments for one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal rigor and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow to the Central European country was when Merkel had difficulty extending the decision to bail out Greece.
Since then it has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and press opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for reform of the Union's Treaties to enable a country to be rescued and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, albeit a little watered down, was approved and in the months ahead we should see the process of reforming the Union to make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old way of working of the euro would be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to cease payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear some of the costs.
Germany is signalling that we must pursue a severe growth path with high saving and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The stakes are clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will bring us some more peace.
And that we seize the opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have heard it in this form too and his twofold statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the path has been paved for the thesis that we need to put order in the house.
But the red line that Germany drew is there, and they don't seem to be moving it.
And among the possibilities being considered, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a currency area too crowded with unimportant countries.
And in that case, Germany can always say that it warned us.
Sports and law-abiding fraud
The similar ruses of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has cast a lot of ink on the unsportsmanlike nature of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and as Real Madrid will end up leading their group, both players will complete the regulatory penalty during the next game of the first leg against Auxerre and can go through to the next round without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and various sums of money to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not quite common in the world of football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of the sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that it involved a team from the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which in the past has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization, it seems, orchestrated by Mourinho, which adds another episode to his long history of being a provocative and histrionic coach.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulations is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are a fraud; because, in fact, they are actions which respect the rules of the sport, but seem to elude their meaning.
The question is what kind of damage they do to the spirit of sport.
One of the goods that comprises the spirit of sport is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect which has not been endangered by these actions, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these goods referred to with fair play is to prevent the offending team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they do not settle for what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty from the referee.
They waited and they accepted the punishment.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders get from the intentional wrongs examined.
It seems necessary to note here that one does not put one's opponent at a disadvantage and one does not gain an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action is to leave one's own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
The advantage is, of course, that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, moving up the ladder, it's not so clear that that's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which nevertheless includes the making of strategic decisions that promote profit as much as the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud), but they chose the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without dodging or avoiding the penalty.
Although the line between genius and legal fraud is blurred, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, I think, arises because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way the principal was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage to the principles of sport caused by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive bids to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship this year has seen a flood of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
There is a proliferation of employee-sponsored celebrations that are willing to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turn and the lottery, when December comes, the group dinners before Christmas also return. They continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but because of the crisis they have led to an offensive to adjust prices to capture the majority of customers: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations in the sector interviewed.
To complete the accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated requests into the week of December 13, resulting so far in a flurry of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the week before.
Since 2008, which is the origin of hard times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize the events out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand a price of battle, says the president of the Barcelona Restaurant Guild, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative now dares not predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book".
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices", he says.
The deal will be good for 'those who provide quality at a good price and with good service', he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so the €25 range has become the majority in demand.
A survey of various centres shows that applications for the night of the 17th have fallen.
The Soteras group says there is a real demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with full formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar meant more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done everything we can to keep prices the same as last year, with all-you-can-eat menus from €19.95 to €30", they explain.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 stores, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in billing since the second half of the year and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources in the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day for groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with €30 or more as the famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, like the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees back and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a bit.
On behalf of the Fecasarm management (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Entertainment Association), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, is confident that the end of the tunnel is beginning to be seen and says that overall bookings are "lively", even if customers "bargain to the max".
True, he says, the expectations for the holidays have not diminished, regardless of who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern in the United States.
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns in Washington about Pakistan's nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - the fact that the weapons are not assembled but are stored in parts to make them difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is a major cause of concern in Washington.
In a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones, the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, stated: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities in the area under Taliban attack, the scattering of nuclear material with a low noise level and the vulnerability of transporting nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the declining educational and cultural standards, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs", said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev during a meeting with his US counterparts.
What's new about the documents leaked through Julian Assange's portal is the decreasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the area of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high degree of nuclear weapons production.
A May embassy cable, calling communication with Pakistan "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often lacking; offers of aid go unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked the US Army Chief of Staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, during a visit to Washington to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistani Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the head of WikiLeaks
Obama will appoint a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All the aspects of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, are a complicated maze where it's hard to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track" Assange's movements.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, otherwise it's dated November 20th.
And this has nothing to do with the recent leak of over a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder lawyer Mark Stephens says "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
On 20 December the international police force with headquarters in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, all 188 countries of Interpol have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Even though Interpol cannot issue an arrest warrant for an individual who is affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a clear path for arrest - which the national police force must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be held.
The move has angered Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder has offered to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, who is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter said.
While the world is searching for him - and in Australia his mother is defending her son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an unknown location an interview with the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign", he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us", he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to downplay Assange's importance contrasts with the views being proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the terrorist list "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to recant his statement after saying Assange would have to be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a lens and use a drone or something".
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind of punishment", he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist executive and an end to the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the eighth internal revolt within ERC, without a north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him the headaches he had with other extinguished currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win over his new critics with eye-winking that will allow him to keep his head down until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to make their views known in secret.
By voting, not by raising your hand.
If the carpenters want to convey some sort of penalty vote to the president, they can do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the commander wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demanded that the president do more than make his position available to the militants, a move that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree a roadmap with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which the management will submit for the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a given.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization able to wash its laundry room as a family once and for all.
In this vein, the article that the current councillor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós' ideologue, the Innovation leader thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five, and he highlighted two.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the activists, that is, to include new figures who come from the sector of Carod's followers.
The second may be the newsworthy nature.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly once and for all as a mechanism for operation.
Thus, he advocated a reform of the statutes that would allow the holding of congresses through delegates elected by popular vote.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of Puigcercós's team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 instructed the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific constitutional reform congress.
The meeting is still incomplete, as the internal tide of recent years has not recommended that this subject be discussed.
Now, with no critical sectors to watch, the time may be right to take it back and shut it down for good.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the State of Mexico's Millennium, there was a four-fold decrease in cases compared with 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two mutilated bodies in Valle de México.
In the penultimate month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theoretical connection with organized crime.
One such case was the body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca.
Subject had at least three gunshot wounds and a single gunshot wound to the head, except for feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan County.
Early Thursday morning, the owners of the common land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshot wounds in the chest on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
A note was found near the body, supposedly signed by the La Familia Michoacana crime organization.
The next day in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was shot eight times as he was leaving his home to start garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-old men were shot in the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement in Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the fatal gunshot to the forehead, a man's body was found on a lonely road in Colonia El Naranjo and a .25-caliber bullet was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in the sewage system at the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
EMTs did a thorough search of the rest of the body parts, but they were never found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted to the discovery of a body in Peña Colorada, with hands tied behind his back and blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been killed, wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a car on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda district of Atizapán, Zaragoza. Two death warnings were found alongside the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in Los Reyes La Paz municipality.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two women wrapped in blankets were found in the hamlet of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was found wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshot wounds to the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, we found Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found in a car in Zinacantepec with at least three bullet wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads covered in a blanket and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens to those who do not conform".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with their hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Officers found a pistol with a message next to it.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country's representative at COP16 said that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and said it is keeping its promise to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China is still committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and rebuild its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's strategy on climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Law, which recognises the objectives set for reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with the government and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multiannual plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments in other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private sector.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another on replacing incandescent lamps with energy efficient lamps and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, said that China's efforts were greater than many thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States they are 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion from Espino: Caesar Nava
The national leader of PAN explained that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
PAN national leader César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to demand what is rightfully his.
In the interview before the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as the governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonoran Law Enforcement Commission".
"Mr Espino has the right to complain to the National Council's Order Commission, if necessary, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body", he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, when a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it was an approach for local elections that was successful and achieved its objective", he mentioned.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we savor it and it makes us stronger", he said.
He said that the board will probably be able to elect the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the job to "the person determined by the board".
"I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's momentum in the July 4 elections will be reflected in the next contest, even though "it is not yet the time to think about 2012".
"For now, we're going to be accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerge from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there are "a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years in office, César Nava asked the PRI members to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet", he said.
He said that the head of the Federal Executive can make statements like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gagging, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter to help undocumented students
"If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national rally today to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation", Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps an open cyber link to a larger document asking the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to listen to your voice", he said.
The message was leaked after all 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding extend.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by all 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other bills like ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Asked about the Republican block on the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think we have plenty of time"...
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year"...
"I think we can get an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will call for a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have been in this country for the past five years, and have been accepted by a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are lobbying hard to secure passage of the bill.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against the bill and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why Dream Act supporters require a majority of Republicans to vote if other Democrats vote against the bill.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of his predecessor, Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position until now.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature, you can put your finger on the wound.
The second stage of the language fun was a walk in which the participants showed off the story
"Sex in language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", the Argentine writer said softly to the audience, mostly young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to the panel moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "plague" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
She leaves the infectious disease clinic convinced that "patience is not my strong suit, it may be my wound".
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the trauma specialist who cut him off in the middle of the hallway, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is the one that is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of language must be closely linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also gave a lovely story he called "Praise to the Invention", where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to speak then America, the great story that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quotes Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (writers) laughed at the false witnesses who appeared in stories presented as real, but in some other way the history of America would never have been told with an imagination that lacked even modesty".
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "fools and liars have the best imaginations" and here reality converges with lies, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one strip or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
"It's your heritage that makes you the story".
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with its round table Le devoir sur la plaie.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican has put her own on the great scourge of social violence her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produced by drug trafficking and drug dealing disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs are a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated", she said, after saying that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the speech of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "the debt to the wound of the committed writer".
He felt that in a world which is living at a high speed, also in the matter of intellectual habits and the control of consciences which is turned to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting our finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricatures, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that be who prefer a world in black and white", he said, inviting us to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano chasing his first title
Rubén Omar Romano lost three finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he made it to the deciding series three times.
With Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles facing off, scored by their technicians, who find a marked contrast between them in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has lost three finals, he's had ups and downs in his career, but he's managed to reach the deciding series three times, even though so far he hasn't put in the effort and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina ended up consolating themselves with the runner-up medal, they stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team they played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback, as his team made a 2-2 draw against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shoot-out he got a 3-1 lead with two chances to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 yards and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he does not want to suffer the same fate, he tries to break free from the curse to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important", commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he says he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can take is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already ready to run and I think this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be decided by penalties, which he is not worried about, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the penalty shootout, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate did not turn us around, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title in our hands, it escaped us, it served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we do not get into this situation again".
Romano now has the opportunity to step away from being a second-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory that titles bring.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centre before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost and waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulate will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicants Service Centre (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The AAC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay one payment for an appointment, another for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-off payment covering all three services.
The current fee will remain the same: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for an application visa (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not have to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Because biometric information will be taken at the CSA, applicants who wish to make a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will be there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26 (U.S.).

NASA to announce discovery of alien life
The U.S. space agency has quoted the press to announce a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington to experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When quoting the press, NASA assured that it would present the results that would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which has prompted speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us in hostile environments that were previously thought uninhabitable and could put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for any life form because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Either way, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life, and this ability leads us to think that similar life could exist on other planets that don't have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, the fact that these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true extent of the findings at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will include geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), with the prospect that its chemistry is similar to Earth's.
The PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón are opposing
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartisanship' is being made possible, it is said.
The 60th had just taken over when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and all four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the start of the 60th Parliament, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo were all against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them from the legislative process.
With this reform, they reiterated, we are starting bipartisanship because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, controlling Congress.
These four members, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms constitute the political marginalisation of the PRI and PAN in an institutional way.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to change the pattern based on political will and if they do not have it, they will be enslaved by both parties again and thus the opposition coalition will end.
"So far (the opposition coalition) has come, that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
He said that the Congress, once monopolistic, cannot be allowed to become "duopolistic".
"It is not in the spirit of law reform that there should be a perpetual bipartisanship in Congress".
To begin with, this group starts with 5 lawmakers and they are now talking to other colleagues to get more, said Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has become a 'booty' between the two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two".
Patrón Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected and that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"They are not leaving by cupola agreements out to 5 who will probably be 9 deputies, now at the five we are seen, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform".
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The city of Mazatlan is paying another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company in question.
Another check for about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the latest check, number 9258447, was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of suppliers' accounts".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the municipality would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Audit Office to sell at a higher price.
What is not reported is the total debt and, therefore, cheque books will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We bought nothing, we just paid him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official State Gazette, as provided for in the Act when an undertaking is interviewed by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
After all this, on July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks that the City issued to its suppliers, revealing that between March 2008 and July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be cleaned
The tourism entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions at the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a ditch at the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants Association, said they have repeatedly asked for the destination's image to be taken care of and that new activities should replace the ones that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk around and they see the mess and avoid the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they wouldn't have done the work for so long and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Hall.
"The mayor will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive maintenance and not just do the corrective", he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we have to maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council has to change its strategy to maintain the city well".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because tourists come, it doesn't just depend on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions", he said.
"They have not been given the attention they deserve and this kind of thing highlights something that is well known to all, maintenance is necessary".
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination".
IP calls for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that the deputies take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector in Mazatlán is calling for a worthy working legislature free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is in convulsion and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, made up of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN deputies, three New Alliance deputies, two PRD deputies, one PT deputies, one Convergencia deputies and one PVEM deputies, a total of 40 people's representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress have is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisan spirit or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that the deputies take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that the MPs will actually exercise their right, free from party agreements because the custom is that they make pacts to protect their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of governors and parliamentary group leaders".
I therefore ask them to certify their commitment to building the necessary bridges that will allow the present Government to move forward.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified job and above all engaged with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 popular representatives is to push and add strength to the economic growth of the state, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate job creation".
On tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generates foreign exchange and investment and competes directly with the agro-industry".
Apart from the fact that we need to allocate resources to detonator tourism projects that help provide security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures failed to resolve.
We're looking for a wizard king.
Among other toys, the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want dolls, cars and bicycles.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their dreams, because their home is made up of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel never lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar, and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desperately desire.
The family lives in a modest house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it is very difficult for us, because my husband has no job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street", says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaida, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted a monster truck, and eight-month-old Jesús Cayetana suggests a year's worth of clothes.
"He (José Alfredo) said, 'I'd like to have this monster,' but I said, 'We'll see, son,' because it was very expensive", recalls Cayetana sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears a size 12 shoe; Isaías, 10, wears a size 10, and Miguel, 8, wears a size 8.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sneakers, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be a big help.
If you want to help make the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family's children a reality you can join the "We're Looking for a Magician King" campaign by donating a toy or money to the Northwest Reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
Around ten searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a network of cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places where drugs were allegedly produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke Courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession with intent to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were the result of a lengthy investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information from the public that allowed us to make these arrests", Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit of the Estre de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Regiment took part in the police operation.
The illegal migration will continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should address the problem of boats carrying illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated after the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter".
"I stand with a party that has created the granite under your feet", said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by lawmakers after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would allow for up to one year of detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does", said Duceppe.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has dismissed criticism that her party is not strong enough on illegal immigrants.
"The NDP agrees that we should take action against smugglers and we are doing that through another bill, Bill C-35", said Ms Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year", Ms Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs in droves that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat".
"They expect Canada to take firm action", Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could have led to elections in the country if it was rejected.
A Conservative told the QMI Agency, however, that the government would call for a vote so that each MP who opposes it would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission into the matter.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil says the idea is not new: Quebec reportedly consulted the New York Department of Investigation about it as early as January.
The Metropolis has had a permanent corruption unit since 1870.
Yet Tuesday's announcement surprised many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on 29 October last, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was only fitting that the PQ critic of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, called the announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a tinkered solution in the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it", he merely said.
"We're aware of that problem".
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign", says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this deadlock, he therefore suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
'We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor-General,' he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cartons of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it more appropriate for this type of crime.
This request is said to have come from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
Federal Minister for Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice Minister colleague Rob Nicholson is currently working on some amendments to the case.
In the spring 2001 operation, which targeted motorcycle gangs, 131 people were arrested, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted.
Ottawa later passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several streams remain under close surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has fallen in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two homes were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide is said to have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road has sunk.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain fell in several areas, with 40 to 70 millimeters of rain falling.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
In addition to the snow melting already in some areas, there is concern that several rivers may overflow.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers to the north, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the Château, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watches and were kept under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused some lakes to overflow, including St. Julienne, St. Marceline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In St. Calyx, a temporary bridge was washed away by heavy rains.
Ten homes had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Ottawa, overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued flood warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partly to blame
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial remarks about welfare and Haitians as well as his on-air slur.
The CCNR found that Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their opinions, but that some of the comments contained "incorrect information about social assistance, unduly negative portrayals of Haitians and rude language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the programme were inaccurate.
The presenters should present solid information rather than misleading information.
In the case of suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had said that suicide was a cowardly act.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be viewed as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the contested episodes of 'Dupont le Midi' have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner".
So no blame was placed on him.
The latest case concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a face-to-face media confrontation that had aroused much reaction.
The host of CHOI said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it was not known for sure that the needy people would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on that".
"My record has been blank for a year and a half", said the host.
In all its decisions, the Committee condemns the use of vulgar language.
In each case, CHOI-FM cooperated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences for the station are minimal, as it will have to announce these decisions once every three days during peak hours.
A kung fu king in Montreal
Montreal native Nacereddine Zemmal has a very special career.
The athlete who excels in sanda (kung fu "full contact"), kickboxing, and Thai boxing climbs tatami mats and rings around the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", said Zemmal, who moved to the capital in 2008 to train as a professional.
"For me, I look for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the floor play of mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America".
Recently, the UPS security guard and employee delivered the bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the World Cup of San Shou".
"Fighters who finished in the top four at the last world championships in each category were invited".
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third", he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've improved in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San shou or sanda is a martial art originating in China where punching and kicking, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Duels were originally held on a platform and less often in a ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this form of combat is Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will surely answer by attending the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This is the most important and prestigious competition in China", said the friendly young man.
"It's a bit like the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)".
"It was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The man who beat me was a real pro", he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80kg, 85kg, 90kg and 90kg)".
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category face off to crown a single champion, the kung fu king".
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts was a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the largest, the project management contract, for a sum of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was formed in 2004 when Hydro-Québec decided to entrust the private sector with the management of this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the energy management consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
The Parti Québécois considers that the use of consortia of undertakings poses a serious ethical problem which may eliminate competition and cause prices to rise.
"It's the new way to collusion and kill competition".
"That is to say, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly", said yesterday the PQ MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he could hardly see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded this afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey", she said, claiming that the PQ had been "dishonest" and "lacking in rigor".
She said it would be the least of the things that the PQ should apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is of a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The construction is under way and is scheduled to last until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition being involved; negotiation took place.
The consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the engineering consultancy sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick glance at the Quebec business register shows that there are over 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau thus works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others such as Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay region responds to particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec has responded to them in a particular way since the 1970s".
The big boss of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte of the James Bay Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made eyebrows that the project management contract was given on a voluntary basis.
"If you go to the auction and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher".
"You have two choices: either you take the people in that market and you say, 'We're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.'"
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the skill of the people", Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gérance is one of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 won by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract to Managed Energy.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau omitted that the PQ was also linked to the firms that "funded" it, before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The green label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and eco-certifications to guide his choices.
The report, entitled 'The Barometer of Responsible Consumption', was published yesterday and was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe in companies' environmental commitment or in green advertising, according to a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Observatory of Responsible Consumption.
The Barometer also found that half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates on so-called fair trade products and the credibility of products and brands that claim to be environmentally responsible.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the political discourse on this subject seriously.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption pattern, which is currently being driven by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
The lack of information and the questionable nature of the information would calm the fears of 46% of consumers.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are also suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services being offered.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their beliefs.
61 percent also preferred to shop at local stores and preferred to buy local produce, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental consciousness seems to remain outside their car, the Barometer shows. In 2010, only 28 percent of Quebecers said they had used public transportation or recommended carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this large-scale behavioural survey, which has just taken its first snapshot.
State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Société Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only on a loan basis.
The development company Angus and the Parallel, which hoped for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy the eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent from Daniel Langlois and restore it to its full cinematic vocation, do not get what they demand.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan, which would be less than originally expected, which could be a viable solution on favourable terms, at least according to sources from the government offices.
A first action plan and a $12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by François Macerola, President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), which is leading the e-centris case.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counterproposal reached the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the State gift really must be rejected.
The Quebec Cinema and Cinema Parks Owners Association opposed direct state investment to support the purchase of Xcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders in the community were instead calling for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the cinemas, spent ten years carrying the cinema in his premises in the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent movie theaters is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to build a loyal following.
The Angus and the Parallel Company, led by Christian Yaccarini, are also running a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition.
As of spring 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to stream movies on eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on February 27th next by showing the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and it is not known what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The sail lifted over a complex Canada...
The new US diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks reveal what the US sees as the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but they also betray the Canadian sense of superiority towards Canada.
So, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter doesn't have Canada-US relations in mind when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, displayed in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, tells how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the amazement of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins, the British government has not yet been able to find a solution.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of the day rather than focusing this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
The United States, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less, given the two countries' intense political and economic relations.
"Logically", he said, "the ability of a candidate, a party and even more so a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote".
Another expression of this sense of importance is found in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, the Ottawa businessman, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, when Canada will run its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion stimulus plan", Breese wrote.
There is no mention that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warned Washington about the increasingly negative image that CBC drama series are giving the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O shows, which make subtle references to Maher Arar, the No-Fly List, and CIA kidnappings for harsh interrogation.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was willing to take some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The secretary has agreed to review the file".
Finally, there is a heated debate about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former close adviser to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the man responsible for the massive leak should be "assassinated".
It echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Worldwide Plan to Repair Lighting
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancun a plan to upgrade domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHG) that is almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan follows on from the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to have adopted in Cancun to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still dominate 50 to 70 percent of the market were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, most of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the global car fleet's emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to bring global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we need to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to stabilise the rise in the climate to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95 percent of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5 percent is produced as light.
With fluorescent light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED light bulbs, the energy requirement is reduced by half.
Fluoridation bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
New LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - which was also involved in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers have guidelines in place.
But the report says that the world's main source of mercury emissions is not the fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the gains each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that cost 2.5 billion to build.
Côte d'Ivoire anxiously awaits election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire to be published "without delay" after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay", said a spokesman for the UN chief.
'It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has delayed Wednesday's deadline of midnight without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CIS had said on television that the committee was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Calls for the CIS to finally announce the winner of the second round between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara have increased worldwide on Wednesday.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council to cancel "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former Forces Nouvelles (FN) rebellion since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian president's campaign manager, said that the FN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The whole election could be called off if Gbagbo's complaints are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents, however, believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao Ndre, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any links to the former rebels, called the delay in the announcement of the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the results because he knows he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from releasing the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to be the culmination of the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country that had been divided for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished first in the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (ILO), remained stable at 9.3% in the capital (9.7% if overseas departments are included), according to provisional seasonally adjusted data published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in the metropolitan area is 2.631 million.
The second quarter data were confirmed for 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% in the OCTs.
Over the year, the unemployment rate is up by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available to work within two weeks and whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% when the DOM is included.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO definition.
The elderly, on the other hand, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), or 482 000 people aged 50 and over, and 6.6% in the DOM.
Only the 25-49 age group enjoyed stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
The INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, however, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Is Tried and Detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste management manager and brother of the PS chairman of the Bouches-du-Rhône general council, was charged and jailed in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of public funds, embezzlement of public funds and property, concealment, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexander Guérini is a combative man and he wants to explain himself on all questions the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies".
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of offences, but it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, insisted, through his lawyers, to send the judge a memo before his hearing in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also questioned Wednesday night and jailed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the use of funds for their operation, he was never aware of this, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the city of Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday with embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and released under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain the facts of the case".
"The investigating magistrate took this into account and did not deprive him of his freedom", said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were questioned and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of cleanliness at Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being charged with "abduction and misappropriation of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", and "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexander Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "suspicion of misuse of social goods".
Among those who confronted Mr Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently implicated in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have been used to launder money from the big bandits.
The investigation is part of a series of court cases opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous emails, alleging fraud in public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
The investigations, which are close to the investigation, focus on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill at La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne and some towns in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysee overstated mediation by Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept French public opinion in suspense, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the underlying causes of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going as far as giving them advice on how to handle their own hostage crisis in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials to benefit Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they cast a stark light on the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to lend credence to the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played a central role in Clotilde Reiss's release.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The French Foreign Minister, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They're explaining the French method to him.
They're advising the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "make noise", they say, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise" in the media, "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise", "make noise" and "make noise" in the media".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to".
Because after attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of delaying manoeuvres".
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: hostage taking for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230 000 euros bail).
And he said that Elisha foresaw further hostage crisis, a situation that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he said.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but she's still stuck in Iran.
The news is spreading: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States is seeking extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris by a judge's order.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran's clandestine networks of nuclear-related procurement, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against the liberation of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
Elisha, he says, was not only "completely taken aback by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the guardian of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision", he observes.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elysee Palace has been making every effort, through statements and "leaks" in the media, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans are not without irony in their observation of this activity, and they see that the manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles are reproducing the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 referred to "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the basis for so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The document then discusses the reasons that led Elisha to make this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the role of Syria", Paris seeks to "show Syria what credit it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy has a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything".
"But we thanked them anyway".
"It should at least confuse the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
South Korean government officials say they will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to require online gambling companies to block access to games after midnight for youths under 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying in school and having a normal daytime life".
"We believe this law is necessary to guarantee their health and right to sleep", Jo Rin, the ministry official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the law's implementation, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the time for daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available free software to people who request it to limit the time they spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various incidents related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
FIFA names host countries for 2018-2022 World Cup
Amid a turmoil over allegations of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday named the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice where power struggles and lobbying risk overriding technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA World Cup will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the sport (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 event will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch governments, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives a measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
The negotiations behind the scenes can therefore last until the last minute.
The other candidates are difficult to rank.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which was behind the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) for corruption, may have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football, which hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC has reversed course on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that features three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is a matter of great concern to FIFA and embarrassment to British officials, who have been engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the forefront.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore Britain's standing with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo has no shortage of assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (World Cup-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the British and doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal only increase the status of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings of its record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a thinly veiled reference to the accusations in the British press against EC members.
"We are covering them with mud, trying to compromise them", Mr Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, building on the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favourite.
The world's largest economy, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have each built a very fine project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries which co-organised the event in 2002.
Another threat is the FIFA-sponsored 2026 World Cup in China, which would effectively make the Asian Games 2022 a lost cause.
With Qatar, which has taken the big game out of the game with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new territories, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it seem as if he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less so.
One warrant for the Elysee calls for another.
So the current head of state will be running in 2012.
But the obvious doesn't go well with the mystery of the presidency.
Then we must pretend that the doubt still exists.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious look, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
The fact that he spoke to UMP parliamentarians at the Elysee Palace on Tuesday evening has caused some fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way from that.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous way at such meetings.
"At best or worst, you'll still have seven and a half years with me", he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step".
His remarks the day before yesterday do not make him more of a candidate than the day before; they do not make him less of one.
If they do, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race to the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry of Ségolène Royal that makes Nicolas Sarkozy reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious, many in the PS are calling for a rearrangement of the battle earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
"If he thinks he can lose, he will not run", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to continue buying government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or at least to announce the termination of a number of unconventional monetary policy operations due to be completed by the end of the year.
The European Union's debt crisis is making it necessary for the Frankfurt issuing institution to be more aggressive than it is now, or it will worsen the more than tense situation on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even greater.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the ECB's active role in helping to resolve the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
It did not say whether it believed the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
'I reserve my thoughts for my European partners ...'.
The day before, at a hearing in Brussels before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more blunt about his intentions, merely saying that the programme of buying government bonds on the secondary market was 'continuing' and that 'we will see what we decide' at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to almost 1.35 billion euros.
And according to market insiders, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have bought EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt that market participants expect further purchases (see page 29).
Neither do economists expect a marked change in course.
While the ECB has already eliminated over-three-month lending operations, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine her changing her schedule in any significant way".
"Otherwise, we risk creating new tensions in the short term", says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm not going to tell you.
In terms of its intervention in the government debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to stimulate a sluggish market", says Norbert Bräms.
Given the size of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs make up for the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a surge in the yields paid by the most fragile states", said a senior bond manager yesterday.
If interest rates soar, governments will have even more difficulty reducing their debt, if not stabilizing it.
The price of saving the euro is this.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back on the
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the fall in 10-year bond rates.
A return to the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, however, the spread to German long-term interest rates reached a record 210 basis points and the price of CDSs (default risk hedging) soared to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the difference with German rates was over 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "very concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In short, its problem is the absence of growth and the resulting stagnation in tax revenues, putting the State at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate is 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the government deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budgetary collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
'If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken,' said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying this for a long time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate or long-term problem, because despite its large debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), Italy is required to make less than other countries to stabilize its economy", says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period of unfavourable decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider strengthening crisis management
Christine Lagarde again hammered it out yesterday at a press conference in Paris: 'The Europeans, I believe we showed again on Sunday day and night, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency area.'
The easing of European government bond rates yesterday, although relative, has brought some water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it may downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most widely-spoken target today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, particularly on the banking system", say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
This is especially true since "political time is much slower than market time".
Conscious of this gap and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are progressing well.
The Commission is also preparing for the Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The menu shows the fate of unconventional support measures for euro area countries in the eyes of the markets (see above).
The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) Executive Director Klaus Regling began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about developments in Europe.
If the purpose of such visits is not to raise funds, he is certainly preparing the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in funds raised by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to the more effective austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to go a different way than Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are determined to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
European donors are also discussing options for speeding up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
During a visit to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to put its hands back in the wallet.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, say that a loan extension of around €100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which has so far received 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and frost.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne, joined the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is affecting the north of Gironde and Charentes and there is little snow on Île-de-France.
Snowfall of 2 to 5 cm, 7 to 10 cm in some cases, is expected in the departments concerned and 1 to 3 cm, and even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is so severe that it can cause traffic problems and disrupt economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côte d'Armor, several departments have been banned for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac lines.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking your vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation has been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods.
The prefecture "requests all motorists to be extremely careful on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to the coming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
The first financial sketches for the Grand Paris Metro
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France was in full swing, billions have been pouring in.
At least in the discussion.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
To start this SGP, the State has announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this sum will then enable the SGP to borrow from the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today we finally get to the first addition.
The 2010 Finance Amendment Act, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains provisions for finding the beginning of this money.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The first, Article 15 of the draft law says, is 'for the benefit of the publicly owned establishment Société du Grand Paris'.
It is estimated: 'The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros a year.'
The second is a reorganization of an existing office tax "to modernize it, increase its revenue and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that be?
It's a mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're a long way from four billion.
'It is stated that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion in capital allocation which will be mobilised by the State and provided to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,' the statement of reasons reads.
At the SGP, we don't find this system shocking.
"Once revenue is generated (both taxes), you can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion afterwards", it explains.
"It will be budgeted and drawn as it goes".
The GSP estimates that EUR 4 billion will start to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
The scheme, which still leaves the promised 4 billion subscribers out of the picture, is likely to provoke a somewhat heated debate in Parliament.
First public hearing on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and spies on the move
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal which only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy which governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file that is created by a secret service (of any nation) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" US revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are just reports that have been in any newspaper for months (except the ones Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's ominously caricatural profile has long been the stuff of cabaret sketches.
The rule that secret files must be composed only of new ones that are already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric literature, you will find that each book - on the Grail, the Rennes-le-Château mystery, the Templars, or the Rose-Cross - repeats exactly what was already written in the earlier books.
Not only is the author of occult texts averse to new research (or uncertain where to look for information about the nonexistent), but those who practice occultism believe only in what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same with the classified files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) is the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be, I don't know, editor at Liberation), who only holds true what he admits.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why have the revelations about these files been such a buzz?
On the one hand, they say what any educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can telephone or fly to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representative exercises, have become spy centers.
Any investigative film-goer knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that people pretend not to know.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore puts the victims in crisis rather than the "executioners".
But let's get to the bottom of what happened.
Back in Orwell's day, you could think of all power as a Big Brother controlling every move of his subjects.
Orwellian prophecy had completely come true since, by being able to control every move through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when you show, as is happening now, that even the crypt of power's secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets stand?
It is true, Georg Simmel said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that anything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all her power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did too much harm to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any confidential information online - it would be like posting it on a street corner poster.
But it is just as obvious that with today's technology, it is futile to hope to have confidential telephone conversations.
Nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew and contacted a colleague.
How will private and private relations be maintained in the future?
I know that my prediction is science fiction and therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents moving discreetly in stagecoaches on uncontrollable routes, carrying only memorized messages or, at best, hiding the rare information written on the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copies in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in a crab-like fashion, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has brought back wired telegraph.
Whereas video (analog) cassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, now CDs (digital) only allow for skipping from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, which includes the trip, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that politics and communications technology have become like chariots on horses.
One last thing.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret embassies.
Now it's the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: How France is faking its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to review the implementation of promises of fast-start financing by developed countries.
And the big French rigging is revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU played the game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciated and appreciated for its worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU says it has committed €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things get more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be 'new and additional' to ensure that additional effort is made without detriment to official development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what is meant by "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, each person chooses the reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, has taken 2009 as the reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of ODA.
On the other hand, France considers that the funding for 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of ODA.
In practice, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), and it claims to be complying with its commitment to 'new and additional' financing.
Another crucial factor is the distribution of donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each person chooses his own calculation method.
Some, such as France, consider that one euro lent is equal to one euro given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given.
But France has no reason to be concerned with such reasoning: it 'fulfils' its €420 million commitment by making 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to make such a massive use of the loan.
Germany requires 46% of the funds, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) meet their commitments with 100% of the funds.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts in €1 to meet its commitment, France puts in only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice trick of the cross.
In short, in its fast start financing, France is committing a double fraud: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action over time and, on the other, on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it succeeds in making it appear that it is spending €420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy was the one who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other member states continue to give if they only have to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early finance is a small one, relatively short-term, compared to the whole climate debate.
But he could be just another grain of sand in the giant machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting for 2011 and 2012 in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with other EU countries.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): the question of "additionality" or the way loans are accounted for will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore in the new environment minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the talks.
Warning of pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Future Generations Association (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistical significance in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem being dealt with", bought between July and September the food normally eaten in four meals and a snack in a day by a child of about ten years in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sweets, have been tested by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded in almost all cases, our survey clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is a cause for concern", the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancer-causing residues and three confirmed cancer-causing residues as well as nearly 20 residues that may disrupt the hormone system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, was found to contain traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide that is banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, which are included in the lunch, and on which the study found traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even the breadstick and gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water was tested for nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of these "cocktails of contaminants" "is probably underestimated", the study says.
The Ecology Europe-The Greens Alliance (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on pesticide use to "combat the urgency of the situation" and to stop "the rise of civilization-diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
