Although an experimental vaccine has been found to reduce deaths from Ebola, no drug has yet shown a clear effect in treating an existing infection.
The ZMapp antibody cocktail initially showed promising results in this area, but official studies have shown that it has less benefit in preventing death than previously expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a reference level, meaning that scientists used it as a basis and compared three other treatment options with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and agrees that it is imperative to create a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes, clubs, and their sports to implement reforms within our organization, rather than revoking its certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how abuse on the scale so bravely described by Larry Nascar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long, and supports all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee share the same goal of making gymnastics and other sports as safe for athletes as possible, so that they can pursue their goals in a safe, positive environment and are empowered.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski served as an adviser to John F. Kennedy, then in the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but it also provides details that would not normally be obtained from fossilised remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were brown at the top and pale at the bottom, or had carotenoid pigmentation.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed rod called peanuts, but do have other distinguishing features - beards and warts - the researchers concluded that peanuts most likely emerged later through the evolutionary development of other distinguishing features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and demonstration.
The researchers suggested that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult, rather than the fluff of a chick.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded near Gaziantep police headquarters in Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than 20 others.

They found that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the number of Rossby stars associated with the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to inversions of the magnetic field.

He added that "they should not, however, be asked to make commitments that go beyond their design stage, responsibilities and capabilities."
Today, at 12: 00 GMT, the Iraq Study Group presented its report.
He warns: "No one can guarantee that any plan of action in Iraq in the current situation can stop a religious war, rising violence, or looming chaos."
The report opens with a call for open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report strongly criticizes almost every aspect of the executive branch's current policy toward Iraq and urges an immediate change of course.
First among the 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative be implemented before the end of this year to strengthen Iraq's borders to prevent hostile interference, and to resume diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the galaxy in Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth while causing tides, so does the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, much of the dark matter around the galaxy is halo-shaped and consists of a large number of small particles.
Television reports reported white smoke coming from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents living near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners and not drink tap water.

In research in the southern African region of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr. Tony Moll has identified XDR-TB, an extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
In an interview, he said the new strain "raises very big concerns because it leads to very high mortality rates."
Some patients may have contracted the disease at the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were health workers at the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multi-drug-resistant TB in a whole group of TB patients still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 currently infected in South Africa.

The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as setting pig traps in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito curtains, and spraying pesticides.
The government has also promised several million vials of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare health facilities for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to the historically hardest-hit areas this year have been put on hold due to a lack of funds and low priority over other diseases.
In 1956, Slanja moved to Sweden, where three years later he started working for the Swedish postal company and became their chief engraver.
He has created more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.

They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface, and warmer at night.
Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain near-constant temperatures, but they correspond to what are deep pits in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the planetary geology division of the United States Geological Survey and the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted using low-tech methods: a voter closes in a booth and puts a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials certify the voter's identity, he places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
France's electoral laws systematize procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes have been added to them other than those of those who were allowed to vote and whose votes were properly counted.
Candidates can send their representatives to oversee the entire process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with a special procedure.

Adekoye was subsequently charged with her son's murder at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being held pending indictment and trial, but any testimony could be distorted, as her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of the photographs to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists do seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other data about suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is largely responsible for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until after the verdict.
The document, according to the leaked information, will address a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of those that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters involved in the supplemental pest control test had to be closely monitored by the Rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), the Shooters Association's hunting program recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage for the Wildlife and National Park Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Marteyi inaugurated a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martey's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
Some 60 cases of defective iPods overheating were reported, resulting in six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor, and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not serious."
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report "very regrettable."
At 07: 19 am local time (21: 19 GMT on Friday), an earthquake struck Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said there were no reports of damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been declared dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were freed earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman as she went to the toilet, and Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynaecologist and began working at Oakland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, he began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that injecting the hormone would increase the ripening of the baby's lungs during fetal development.
State investigators found two flight recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday, Xinhua reports.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreemer said: "The moon was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. The moon passed away on the night of the two moons.
Dustin "Goldfinger" Rannells said: "Luna was just as plump as me... Maybe even more plump... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people polled in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II.
34% share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The poll found that 29 per cent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is now in doubt following his complaints.
He was unable to take the drugs needed to relieve pain, as they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using a variety of hardware and software.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, because comets have been colliding with the Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the US Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology to replace the old ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft positions and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport to Wembley, no ground trains will stop, and there will be no surface parking or interception facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transport led to speculation that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A description of the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, describes the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that the mating of Darwin's endemic beetle (Geospiza fortes) with the migrating cactus beetle (Geospiza conirostris) made it possible for the new species to evolve in just two generations, although the process was thought to take much longer.
Gold can be given any shape. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be stretched into thin wires that can be woven and plated, and can be minted or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books - the so-called "front manuscript."
This is called a pH chemical. You can make an indicator by using the juice of a red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation of the hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound under study.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Get the new mixture by mixing two dry powders in one container, and then using clean, wet hands, form a ball out of the mixture.
Moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, then form what looks like a shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo Daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remaining fragments of sewage systems have been found in homes in Minoan towns on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women washed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet high is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed our world in an incredible way. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is give us a much lighter and faster transport.
It gave us a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them are a larger number of medium-sized cats that eat small prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including walking domestic cats) eat and hunt for many more small animals like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of niche, the special work that each cat species does, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of one to three adult males related to each other, as well as females and cubs, which can number up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pride behaves very much like a pack of wolves or dogs - animals that are surprisingly similar in habits to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their victims.
As an all-around athlete, a tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five strong people.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (the Panthers) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who have the ability to roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar, but more like a cry out of inaudible words.
Ocelotes like to eat small animals. If the chance arises, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals that ocelot hunts are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow in the footsteps of animals and find prey by smell, tracking their movements on the ground using their sense of smell.
They are able to see perfectly in the dark with night vision and move almost imperceptibly. Ocelotes track down their prey, merge with the surrounding environment, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they previously lived.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from those it had before to become a strong contender.
The original population has not changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it becomes less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, in thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to say that they are the same species.
We call this process species formation, that is, the emergence of new species. Species formation is a necessary consequence and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants are fed from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also cast a shadow.
We build our houses and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the most formidable predator of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were dotted with more than 70 sharp teeth, and there was an extra row on his forehead, so that those who met him had no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that his tongue was bifurcated. He ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the tyrannosaurus would have matched it.
Even though most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served at feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a species of rodent called dormouse.
There was another difference: while the poor and the woman ate on chairs, the rich liked to party together, where they ate on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of the gods on the main sanctuary, which was considered to be God's dwelling place.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to please the gods in ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple court and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called "zikkurats" were built as elements of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter much.
Much of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops had open counters facing the street; stone was used to build the houses.
Canaan land did not have large forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian saga tells the story of Eric the Red being expelled from Iceland for murder, and moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the film Treasure of the Nation, you might think that there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence it is written: "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days this large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches) was folded up for easier storage.
Thus, it is likely that the entry was added simply as a mark.
As a result of Operation Neptune and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was under the control of the "Vichy" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of confronting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion dubbed "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, Free France and the Americans liberated southern France and set out for Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture that is carried by a sufficiently large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, which means "citizen," and is related to the Latin civis, meaning "citizen," and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also expresses the size of society in a certain way.
Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous cultural presence, and a continuous diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without adequate historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the US War of Independence, thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, formed for the first time a weak central government, with Congress as the sole body.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state governments, which were often uncooperative and unwilling to enforce all of its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments under the articles require unanimous approval by all states, but the states have been so irresponsible toward the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island!
Due to its membership in a cluster / group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan dates back many years, to the 15th century, when European navigators passing by wrote down the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating the transformation of aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coasts, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings around the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they looked like in the first place.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for static photos is 35mm, and it was this size that was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analog era.
Today, it is still being produced, but more importantly, its aspect ratio inherited the image size of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small integers) is therefore assumed to be 3: 2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The all-too-often-used and often-derided third-party rule is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while preserving a certain amount of order in the image.
It says that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Its pervasive power touched everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the central Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's money exists for that purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power has been based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this dogma is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade has violated universally accepted international laws set out in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Because the reaction to these tactics was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unhindered underwater military action.
Among most citizens and peoples in the 1920 "s, pacifism and isolation prevailed.
Having learned of the horrors and atrocities of World War I, states wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted an offer to work for Edison in New York City.
He arrived in the US with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former boss, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique way to denote periods of time; every stage of China, or every family in power, was a special dynasty.
Moreover, there was fragmentation and instability between the governments of each dynasty, most famously during the Trinity, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce fighting took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for a place on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs to the people, not to the individual ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, job opportunities opened up for all men, enabling the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the army, because ranks have become based on merit rather than on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed members of the working class in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to the mundane life. He often visited the cave that became known as "Khira" on Mount Nur (light) for reflection.
And the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located at the top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find even those who know about its existence. In the cave, a person is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Only a very small part of the world can be seen and heard from the depths of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was erected by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheopas' wives and relatives.
The sign of the upward motion of the bow looks like a V, and the downward motion of the bow looks like a staple or square without the underside.
"Up" means you have to start at the tip and move the bow forward, and "down" means you have to start where your hand holds the bow and move it back.
The upward motion of the bow usually produces a softer sound, whereas the downward motion of the bow is stronger and more assertive.
You can draw your own hatching, but remember that hatching is for musical reasons, and it is usually worth following.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowds forced the King and Queen to open their windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of a terrified Queen.
The military costs of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to pay most of the costs and interest on bonds moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the windfall profits from the long exploitation of the Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led them to create the order.
The epoch in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages replaced the Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to conventional wisdom, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative to the strict view that people's destinies are driven by fundamental logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technology is almost immune to cultural or political influences, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is due to its own properties, not to society.
For example, one could say that automobiles are a necessary cause of road development.
But the national road network is economically unprofitable for only a small group of vehicles, and new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, leading to the invention of new treatments for injuries in the health sector.
Romanticism in many ways included the cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time associated customs and cultures emerged that, in harmony with the place in which a given society lived, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its glory as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than the goods on offer in Byzantine markets.
It was at this point that the title of Fashion Capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the tenth and eleventh centuries and the fourteenth century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag 25-30 years behind.
Own styles began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, thanks to the crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his / her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses the seeds of plants growing in a given ecosystem, together with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Sub-cultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by society's standards, and allow such people to define for themselves who they are.
Sub-cultures may differ according to the age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and / or gender of the people they comprise.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular subculture often assert their identity through idiosyncratic and symbolic use of style, including through fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases in which children, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, have not had contact with adults during their adulthood.
Such children are called "savage" or "wild." Some savage children are isolated by people (usually their own parents), and in some cases the abandonment of their child is the result of their parents "rejection of their serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before escaping or being abandoned.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some lived in the wild on their own.
If he is fully reared by animals instead of humans, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of physical limitations) that are almost identical to the particular animal that raised him - for example, his fear of, or indifference to, humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more interesting, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Skrepysh in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, which helps with learning, is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed in care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where nurture, care, and education are not provided, but grow up.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our guardianship system must provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scale in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
Thus, it has been suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "long-term engagement" were also identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people responded to Web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
In "The President's Speech," Oliver Sachs described how people who, because of brain damage, are unable to understand speech can still correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
He suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies conducted in the twentieth century have shown that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and pronounced.
The mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of manifestations of variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs with available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so would have serious consequences such as stunting growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like us if not cooked.
By contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also a rich source of proteins containing all major amino acids.
Given all of this, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" much as chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Interruption of sleep is a process of purposeful awakening during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, which are based on biological rhythms, include taking large amounts of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, causing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality that is present in you. Each person is potentially given absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tensions and negative attitudes.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayan way of love and a variety of Indian yoga techniques.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-consuming love.
The energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is believed to be the Yoga of the Deities. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are launched, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war ended, differences over system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War broke out.
It was to last for the next 40 years. It was truly fought, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when some 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The job of seafarers has traditionally been to ensure that a country is able to move its people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples was a company in the North Atlantic during World War II, which tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop the traffic.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats, usually children or adolescents, similar to the more common shepherd's activity, which is still used today.
Cars were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the track was only parallel to the tree bars, it enabled horses to carry larger loads and at a higher speed than the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
Sleepers were used long ago to hold the rails in place, but it later became clear that the tracks were more efficient with an iron band at the top.
This became common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first railways were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transport was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
For their Australopithecus ancestors, straightedness was not so common.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropologist may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living with more concern for the environment. We can become members of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to alleviate some of the further suffering.
If we need more than a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as a result of human scientific and technological progress, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have made the challenges greater.
After Congress passed the bill on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
150-200 copies, now known as "Dunlap's Leaflets," were produced overnight.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9 ordered it to be read to his troops in New York. The copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy did not reach us.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one of the groups of dinosaurs survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Often they are not seen as dinosaurs because they have feathers and are able to fly.
But there is still much to be said for birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have paws with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind paws like Ti-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" - or "bits," to use computer jargon.
Oral poisoning can be difficult to detect immediately; symptoms such as vomiting are too common for a quick diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used formally by entomologists to refer to a group of insects.
This concept comes from bed bugs known since ancient times - insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species adapted to live in their host's nest or dwelling.
There are an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the US, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that twice as many women as men suffer from multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their or their child's best interests.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights in order for the other couple to adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method, which is, in fact, at the heart of most scientific research.
But it is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), questioning, and observation.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, are recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle autonomously for a period of time, even in the absence of external incentives.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, tagging the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage's radioactive sulphur protein.
Mutations can produce a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected portion of the genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their place of work, and pass by those whose place of work is in the place they have just left.
In this active traffic, everyone is connected in one way or another to and supports the car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that the huge hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are they failing every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out as part of the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the volume of traffic, because it is impossible to predict a driver's behavior with 100% probability.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often fairly systematic; thus, traffic flows as a whole are somewhat systematic and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three main values: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly made it easier to escape enemies, find food, and find partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more hiding places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and scaffolding are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems like a sensible idea, because we don't feel that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
As much as 20 per cent of the water flowing from our planet's rivers into the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and thousands of small rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the size and technical sophistication of the pyramids at Giza could not be surpassed.
In the new kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors more than a thousand years ago.
The Vatican has a population of about 800, the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in pure form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything consisted of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, though he also assumed that they would change to a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit at the end of that sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing techniques, the pencil lost its former status and became less used.
People now write messages on computer screens and never have to deal with a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard, with the advent of newer technologies.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to have many protons and neutrons in the same nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Then the re-splitting of the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to disintegrate with little or no effect.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick under the oceans and 100 km thick under the continents.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more moon seas on the visible side, because the crust there is thinner. Lava was easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what makes people act or may interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and / or desires that accumulate within as they grow older.
These theories address what makes particular people want to do what they do, and what makes their environment do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Motivation Theory.
Typically, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead people who were previously equal in status to them. One extreme of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "their guy" (or girl).
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, discipline, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and appropriate it for himself or herself.
After all, the manager is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same skill standards as regular teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than members of traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which is not always understood by local officials.
Having a real "invisible team" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" is a leadership team to which each participant is accountable. An invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why should an organization go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals of putting the concepts of self-learning organizations into practice.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional areas of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that is in the best interests of the client.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge-sharing, and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the "continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
These neuroscience findings provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, thus narrowing the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of data and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that are taking place in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that considers the behavior and learning of machines and the "inculcation" of their intelligence.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples: control, planning and scheduling, responses to client diagnoses and questions, and facial recognition, handwriting, and voice recognition.
Such issues are highlighted in separate disciplines, the aim of which is to solve the problems we face in our daily lives.
Today, the AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being built into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Study tours are very important for any class. Teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Posting the excursion in a virtual space for all to see is also a great way to refresh the memory of the excursion and share what you have learned with future classrooms.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a site about their visits to the state capital, and each year the site is updated, but older versions are still available as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also improve students "writing skills.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the author of a blog tends to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, by blogging, "students become more aware of the world around them." Students are encouraged to be smart and interesting, attracting readers "attention (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of others "work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with a host of art galleries and museums revealing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is a fiefdom of pristine natural beauty in Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of this and more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are rarely inhabited, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising comparison of population size: there are more African-Americans in the US than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than others and is a continent of its own in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as chic beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama opened the way through the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: All female tourists are encouraged to say that they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not too expensive to look at).
Women should be aware that, because of cultural differences, they may feel harassed, harassed, held by their hands, and so on.
Definitely refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but left it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Ed Dar el Beida, and the Spanish traders who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is safe enough, information about any travel outside Goma should be clarified in advance to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu.
It is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and you can see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can go to Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic outback.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage threatened by the desert sands.
While shooting Henry Louis Gates's show, "The Miracles of the African World," on PBS, one of the most important stops was here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, because it has an Arab flavor rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, its southern border being the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km ² and has 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be one of South Africa's leading national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there is a daily charge for guarding and visiting the park.
It can also be profitable to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South Africa's national parks either selectively or all.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider their main focus.
The string of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline is compared to a gleaming bar chart highlighted by Victoria Bay water.
To see Hong Kong's most scenic spots, leave the island and head to the coast of the Kowloon Peninsula, which is opposite.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on seafront land on the north shore.
It is a place that the British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the largest belt of coastal mangroves stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarban National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted reindeer currently live there.
Buses leave the interregional bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar / Bumtang, depart from 06: 30 to 07: 30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and reliable.
The route is a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapoc River is a cable-stayed bridge that extends over the Oyapoc River and connects the cities of Oyapoc in Brazil and Saint Georges de l'Oyapoc in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high and the bridge itself is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.5 metres wide.
The bridge has a height of 15 metres and was completed in August 2011; it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guarini were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various groups of local tribes, such as Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, previously known as the "vast province of the East Indies," emerged as a result of a clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its identity and character.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and the best players in the world in the sport of polo.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the golf course in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched at other times of the year.
For news about polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located on Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds will be accepted everywhere on the islands. Stanley also often accepts credit cards and US dollars.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance what payment method is acceptable.
Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the Falkland Islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. During the summer months, temperatures above + 30 ° C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons here: the amount of precipitation is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves more than 100 yards / meters, or any other wild animals more than 25 yards / meters!
No matter how humble they look, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the right distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their privacy.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly food with you, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Founded in the 1850s, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All but one British cruiser sank, killing about 200 American and German sailors.
During the Mau's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of Paramount Chief Tupua Tamsese Lealofi III.
There are plenty of beaches here, because Oakland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe bathing, and many are shady thanks to trees like pohutukawa.
In downtown Oakland, where the upscale residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers are located in Whitemata Bay, Tamaki Drive stretches out.
It is sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. It is safe to swim.
The most popular local beer is "Number One," which has an unpretentious, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines can be better transported.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is also easy to find.
Australians don't understand the idea of "Flat White." "Little Black" is espresso, cappuccinos are served with a high layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of superior quality.
There is a large number of trips to the reef all year round, and injuries caused by any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubomedusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries north of 1770 from October to April, and can sometimes be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and swim away.
Ringed crocodiles are not active in the ocean, and their main habitat is estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler to avoid having to worry about where to spend the night upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through a travel agent and other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically sell packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination package that includes flights and hotel accommodations.
In addition, they can keep the booking if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or queries must first be sent to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants spend the night on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a mandatory part of the programme.
If you want to be near the stage, you need to arrive in advance to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may already be over, there may be areas at the festival where music will continue to be played late into the night.
At some festivals, there are special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as walking on the ice produces a rather eerie noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city walks. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms and conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time as possible and as much money as possible in the establishment. There are no windows or hours, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and keep them entertained.
Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds the mind, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to travel over high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you won't be able to drive like you would on ordinary asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get stuck in can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be reduced due to snow, blizzards, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
Snow and ice conditions, on the other hand, are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost without interruption all year round.
Safari is probably the biggest attraction for tourists in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday use means a land trip to see Africa's stunning wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach machines, so with conventional equipment you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you see them better through binoculars.
Hiking safaris (also known as "bush exploration," "hiking safaris," or "walking tours") consist of hikes lasting from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, first held here in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules may differ, but as of the end of March, most of the rules related to coronavirus do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes helps it dry out. Many hotels rent an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron on hand or don't like the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if you do.
Do not expose the tissue to too high a temperature (which can lead to shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it will take a few minutes.
Filters are effective in different ways, and in case of doubt, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles and from a trustworthy company.
Travellers can encounter pests they have not seen in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, release poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and excise duties at certain points.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on goods such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fermon has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated, remote and wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns prevail.
Speed limits are markedly lower than on previous and subsequent stretches - typically 35-40mph (56-64km / h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than anything else.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service here is much better than on many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are pretty good. In Bavaria, they are abundant and varied, and resemble those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apple pastries are year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
German pastries often use almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Often popular cakes go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastry, try what, depending on the region, are called tinned bowls or doughnuts.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, the curry can be "dry" or "wet."
In the interior of Pakistan and northern India, yogurt is widely used in curries. In southern India and parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a generic term used to describe the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without specification, the term most often refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes an assortment of unpretentious flavors. Javanese prefer flavors such as peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stremena are supports for the rider's feet, hanging from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues as there is a chance of getting stuck in the leg.
A number of precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel that have a smooth and rather thin sole.
In addition, the individual saddles, especially the English ones, are equipped with safety arcs, thanks to which the leather arrow falls off the saddle if it is pulled backward by the falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is Chile's main destination for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosmite of South America and has many large granite walls and cliffs.
At the top you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its great potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve downhill skiing or snowboarding on snowy terrain.
Alpine skiing is the main tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (sometimes called "skiers") who plan their holidays entirely around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock drawings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the seventeenth century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Ski tourism This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or hiking.
This is related, but usually does not include hiking to the top and then down unprepared slopes, as whole-grain skiing requires tougher skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski route is a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly more distances than you can on foot, but cross-country skiing can only achieve this speed on very rare occasions when you don't have a heavy backpack and have a paved ski trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. In normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for a visa and undergo multiple passport controls.
But the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Once in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which saves you time and money, as well as avoiding red tape.
There is no universal definition of what products are antiques. Some tax authorities define 100-year-old goods as antiques.
There are geographic varieties in which the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding reindeer herding is also important for many other occupations.
Although this is a tradition, not all Sami were involved in mass reindeer herding; they lived fishing, hunting and other such activities, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because of associations associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit is covered by travel advisories, it may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You may also need to consult with governments other than your own, but their recommendations are aimed at their own citizens.
To cite one example, US citizens in the Middle East may face situations that Europeans or Arabs cannot face.
The news reports only briefly describe the political situation in one country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, vague, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information that is widely available.
Adverse weather conditions are a generic term for any severe weather event that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Adverse weather conditions occur everywhere in the world, and they come in a variety of species that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and forest fires are the manifestations and effects of severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, water storms, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather hazards include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to consider any risks associated with severe weather in their area as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should be trained.
An Internet search using the phrase "hostile environment safety course" might give the address of a local company.
The course usually takes a much more detailed look at all the topics covered here, most often with hands-on learning.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes simulation, a lot of first aid information, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral passports (X) or gender-updated documents varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to meet their obligations under these instruments also varies widely.
Checkpoint inspections have also increased significantly since the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Sediment currents are currents created by waves crashing against the shore, or sometimes against a reef or something like that.
The reverse flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where a fast current can form, going deeper, because of this underwater topology.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue when trying to swim against the current, which may not be possible.
Once you get out of the current, it won't be harder than usual to swim back.
Try going where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted, you may have to wait for rescue.
The shock of returning to one's home country comes earlier than the culture shock (a shorter romantic period here), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers needed to adapt in a new country.
It may come as a surprise to people that patience and understanding should also be shown to travelers who have returned home.
The sound and light show against the background of the pyramid is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
Pyramids can be seen in the dark, and you can also see them in silence before the show begins.
Normally, there is always noise from tourists and salesmen. The history of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx acts as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
Opened in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries, which have the largest number of bases, with 16 operational in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named after King George with the settlement of Villa las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Desepchênes, where the flooded caldera of the hitherto active volcano provides an impressive natural haven.
Ellsworth Land is an area south of the Antarctic Peninsula washed by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains here merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth mountain system, divided by the Minnesota Glacier in two.
In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinel Ridge, there are the highest mountains of Antarctica - the Vinson massif, the highest point of which reaches 4,892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote places outside the reach of mobile communications, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be in the street within direct view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure craft and fast boats, where there is a need for remote data and voice communication.
As a rule, you can get more information about how to activate this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular among those planning to take an academic year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before going to university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a sabbatical can actually improve your chances of enrolling in higher education at home.
As a rule, tuition fees are charged for admission to such educational programmes.
Finland is a great place for boat tourism. The "land of thousands of lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
Whether exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can do without a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave a very different impression.
Boating is a national form of leisure in Finland. In particular, there is one boat for seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands it is between one and forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include extended stopovers in Russia's St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend a few full days in this historic city and spend the night on a boat.
If you come ashore only as a boat excursion, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be daunting for people of all ages and social status, especially if it is their first flight in life or if they have had a traumatic experience in the past.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is no different from the personal animosity and fear of other things that so many people have.
Understanding how an aircraft works and what happens in flight can help overcome the fear that arises from uncertainty or inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well paid for speedy delivery. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies this has been a problem.
If they sent anything like air cargo, some routes could take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to deal with it more quickly is to ship it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger, so you need to be involved.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out for the privilege (or, better yet, make your company pay for you).
However, it is not cheap at all - experience in rough approximation shows that you will pay four times more than usual economy class for business and eleven times more for first class!
As a rule, there is no point even in looking for business or first class discounts for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a pittance for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has fallen victim to ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of a self-proclaimed Transnistrian republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million people, the largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed and lively shopping centre, located along a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, modern shopping malls interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, though the city has more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldorsvik overlooks the nearby island of Esturoi and houses an unusual octagonal church.
In the church cemetery above some graves there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons.
It's worth taking a half-hour to walk around an unusual village.
A relatively short distance to the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which was celebrated by Lord Byron and has since become famous around the world.
The Scotturb 403 runs regular services to Sintra and stops at Cape Rock.
To the north, visit also the great Temple of Our Lady of Fatima (Tomb), the site of the world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are, in principle, at the site of a mass grave and a place that is indescribably important to a large percentage of the world's inhabitants.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their stay here, but there are many more whose loved ones were killed here or worked there to death, whether Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves - don't joke about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not desecrate this place by spraying or scratching graffiti on objects around it.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and other public places.
Ordinary announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned outages are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known as egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave as a "bien élevé" (well-mannered) person, which will greatly facilitate adaptation in the city.
The unwelcoming appearance of Parisians will immediately evaporate if you show a little basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its combination of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, it represents a particularly wide variety of plant communities.
The area is teeming with many different species of animals and birds.
Here you can find rare representatives of fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and grouse, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and with their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give vestments to women who come unprepared, but if you take your own, especially bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
They, too, can be taken at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after every use, so you may feel uncomfortable in these skirts. One size for all men!
Mallorca's cuisine, as well as that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread and meat (especially pork), with the widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular lunch dish, especially in summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available filling, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning you, are always capitalized even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and additions.
It is also likely to simplify reading, while writing is somewhat complicated by the need to ascertain whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most of the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
You should be particularly careful with the letters c and g, as their pronunciation varies with the subsequent vowel.
Don't forget that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means "road" and carro means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and largely regular grammar.
So reading this textbook of Persian grammar will help you learn a lot and understand the expressions better.
Obviously, if you speak the Latin subgroup language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hasten to conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to be taught separately.
Ancient observatories are now generally considered obsolete and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Because light pollution was not a problem in their heyday, they are usually located in cities or campuses that are easier to reach than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Contemplation of sakura blossom, called "khans," became part of Japanese culture as early as the eighth century.
The idea came from China, where the plum flower was a favorite flower.
In Japan, the first Sakura flowering celebrations were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so don't be tempted to take a single specimen.
When you visit an officially organized garden, collecting "samples" will also result in you being kicked out without any conversation.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to navigate, and almost everything can be bought upon arrival.
But if you find yourself in the "deep tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (under cloudless skies, less frequently).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the legendary burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are about to board is bound for Hebron, not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good place to celebrate.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, cruising the Danube, or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also identify routes for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night without going to bed in some open place to see the sun rise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend, with parishioners usually starting at midnight to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands have swam, flown or been nailed down by the current.
Because of their distance from the continent, the mammals could not get there, making the giant tortoise the main herbivore in the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs, have been imported.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will learn what the polar night is like when the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Because these areas are sparsely populated, and as a result light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japan's work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Costumes are standard business clothing, and colleagues refer to each other by name or position.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, and team performance is valued above individual achievement.
Normally, employees must obtain the permission of their superiors before making any decisions, and must obey the orders of their superiors unconditionally.
