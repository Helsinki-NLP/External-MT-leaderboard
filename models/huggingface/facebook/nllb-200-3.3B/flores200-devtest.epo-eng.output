Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widespread theory, but it also provides details that the fossil record cannot provide, such as color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored undersides.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stalk called a rakia, but did have other features of feathers like branches and twigs, the researchers concluded that the rakia was probably a later evolutionary achievement than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but more likely for thermoregulation or for display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not a feathery plume, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur.
The researchers speculated that the specimen showed adult plumage and not an ivory shell, although it was a tail of a young dinosaur.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby index of a star, which refers to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby index, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, however the program was written to simulate an observation made on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team sought the effect that the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter would cause.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tidal forces, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy is surrounding a galaxy like a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very disturbing and alarming because it has a very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll thinks that some patients may have been infected by the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two of those patients are health workers in the hospital.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 proximal ones.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of TB patients seems to be negligible; 6,000 of the 330,000 total infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put the pre-printed piece of paper with a reference to their preferred candidate in an envelope.
Once officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
The French electoral law codifies the procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, polling stations must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes before the start of the election and that no envelopes are added except those of the orderly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process, and in the evening, volunteers carefully count the votes according to a specific procedure.

Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court, charged with the murder of his son.
She is being held pending formal charges and trial, but any witness testimony can be affected, as her image has been widely circulated.
It's a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, and courts view publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line if they publish photos or other details of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, explained to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is made.
The document, according to the leak, will reference the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to have based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other relevant issues, it is said, will include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, while the PA agrees to leave the presence for only five years.
The firing of the shots in the attempt to help control the plague had to be closely observed by the foresters, while the attempt was studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, we recruit qualified volunteers as part of a Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy to the Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four selected for the first firing operation gunmen received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new nine-member Electoral Council of Perpetuity (CEP).
It's Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of a measure to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failed organization of elections, some of which were postponed from 2011.
About 60 cases of burning of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEKI) reported that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, MEKI announced that Apple had reported 34 new cases of overwork, which the company called "minor".
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's delay in the report "very regrettable".
The quake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' office of emergency management said there were no reports of damage on the ground.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage, having caught their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been released, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed his father's example and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that hormone delivery accelerated the maturation of fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
On the extreme ends of the poll, 29 percent of those polled think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his ability was questioned.
He could not take the medication he needed to treat his pain, because it is forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known today on January 25.
A few people confirmed the discovery, using various devices and software, until the early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water supply for Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets began colliding with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow flying machines to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year, and also reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is operated, and the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, nor are there any parking lots or park-and-drive facilities on the site.
Concerns about transportation shortages have increased the likelihood that the game will be played behind closed doors, without any team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have told us that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process probably took longer, due to a mating between the endemic Darwinian finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a variety of shapes. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
You can pull it out of it to get a thin wire, which can be folded and braided, you can hammer it or roll it into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using beet juice.
The colour of the water changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of their electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, moist hands, squeeze them together into a ball.
Wet on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel weird and form a shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a complicated network of sewers.
Remains of sewerage have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in a mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the phone call and reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partly distorts light and vision.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing that the wheel has made possible is providing much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it, we have a train, a car and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are the larger medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless pet cats) that eat the much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a specialization that every cat retains, so that they do not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in groups called herds.
A herd consists of one to three related adult males and many to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds function quite similarly to wolf or dog herds, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to the prey.
A very athletic and harmonious animal, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump at great distances and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar with a loud voice, but more like a sentence of hoarse, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds whenever possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find edible animals (prey) by smell, sniffing the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very inconspicuously. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment and then swooping down on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) splits from the main population from which it originated (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will have to, in order to be a strong competitor, have other characteristics or adaptations than those they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over the course of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people inhale, and they take away carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetation. Without vegetation, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in its mouth, meaning that nothing that met it could escape.
We are not sure, but it may have had a bi-lingual tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mozas, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus wouldn't have a chance against it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their own set of strange or unusual festive items, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called gliro.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, rich men liked to have feasts together where they would rest on their sides, eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome could not be foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a great temple that was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open sales tables facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was driven from Iceland for murder, and along the way further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimensions are 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled for storage.
So it's probably just added as a label.
The landings of D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south still remained unfree.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture co-owned by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also this in some ways defines the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture implies a transmission of knowledge through a few generations, a lasting cultural trace, and a fairly large dispersion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with a congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it entrusted the enforcement of its decisions to state agencies, which were often uncooperative.
Nor could it override tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before any change, and states dealt with the central government so casually that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the indigenous ways of grain production and employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied western and northern border areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most commonly used format in the world for shooting still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but, more importantly, its proportions were inherited from the sensitive formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (APS format, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much-insulted and often-laughed-at rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, holding a measure of order in a picture.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, became the object of critical scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's funds exist specifically for this purpose.
For more than a thousand years the central authority of the Church was in Rome and this concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this dogma was obeyed.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade breached generally accepted international law codified by some international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain had cut off international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since such a tactic had limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited military use of submarines.
During the 1912s the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during the First World War, nations wished to prevent a recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at the previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of showing different time periods; each era in China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Also among all dynasties was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of such periods was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, fierce fighting took place among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the subway system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, posts were opened to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they were now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside this everyday life. He frequented a cave which became known as Hiraj on Mount Noor (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is absolutely isolated from the rest of the world.
And in fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you're in the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains a number of pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a number of small tombs, a number of temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples many were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arch up" mark looks like a V and the "arch down" mark like a bracket or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the heel (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow usually produces a more delicate sound, while the downward bow is stronger and firmer.
Don't hesitate to add your own crayons, but remember that the printed arches are there for a musical reason, so they should be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Madame Elizabeth were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on 6 October 1789.
They drove to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people, making noise and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen open the carriage windows wide.
At one point a mobster waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenditures of the US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits derived from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped found the Order.
The period in which the events occur is usually called the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends by consensus around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has consequences for societies that are intrinsically intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we could say that the automobile necessarily led to the evolution of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being designed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, the geography shaped individuals and with the passage of time there appeared customs and culture related to that geography, and those, more harmonious with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
In the 12th century, its status declined primarily because the Crusaders returned with silk goods and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine bazaars.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style had its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But because of the slow media, styles in the West could be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the important achievements of the period was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to enlarge a crop.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence farming and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views, who feel excluded by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguishable by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a particular subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subcultures often mark their membership with a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, while growing up, due to neglect, bad luck or malicious mistreatment, were not socialized by adults.
Some children who have gone wild have been taken prisoner by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of a child has been due to the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability of a child by the parents.
Children who went wild were more likely to experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
Raised only by nonhuman animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the framework of physical limitations) almost completely similar to those of the particular caretaker animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, and a teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into a software and must ask, suggest and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner if he acted on his own.
Children find themselves in a foster home for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even bullying.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring and educational, but it still happens.
We look at the guardianship system as a safety zone for these types of kids.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
And the curate shall supply all things that were wanting to them in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet give an extra dimension to the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socializing are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified personal engagement and lasting relationships as new motivational factors when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech suggested that people who cannot understand speech due to brain trauma can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even assumes that such a capacity to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds a new gene variation, and selection removes it from the group of visible variation.
Split and recombine remixes the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans have to satisfy their need for amino acids from available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: slower growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily obtainable plant resource would be protein that can be obtained from leaves and beans, but that's hard for primates like us to digest unless it's cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
So, given all the circumstances, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a manner similar to how chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10×60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully awakening.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, which will make you get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is negatively correlated with the degree of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the way to that goal is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga. By imagining various deities, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused the countries to split.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would have real battles, with alternative armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope remained to retreat and reorganize under the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and dismantled the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, breaking the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany could probably conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and furs.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds roaming on hills and other pastures, often tended by goat herders, who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Railways were being built in England from no earlier than the 16th century.
Although railway carriage tracks were simply made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
The shells appeared early enough to hold the tracks in place, but it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron stripe on top.
This became a popular practice, but iron caused faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known transportation was by walking, humans began to walk vertically two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often.
Dupied specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although coastal anthrops may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even be activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
It's like taking anti-symptomatic medication in many cases, but if we want more than just a temporary fix, then we have to find the root cause of the problems and we have to deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been greatly changed by the scientific and technological achievements of mankind, and problems have been made greater by the overpopulation and wasteful lifestyle of mankind.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the press office of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
In one night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's Posters".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on 6 July to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs, like a tyrannosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information processing, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a medication or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific toxin.
The term bug is a formal term used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Rabocytes and bedbugs are both nidicula, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or their child's best interests.
Such couples may choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
During an adoption procedure, the biological parents cease their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand by scientific method how the world works. This method actually guides most of the scientific research.
But it's not alone; it's also an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to test one or more possible hypotheses, and questioning and observation are the guides of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became evident as it became separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of self-repeating functioning even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacterial phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the wrapped piece of genetic material and whether the wrapped cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and take photos and learn about orangutans.
Every morning people leave towns by car to go to work, and are passed by others who are heading to the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is somehow involved and contributing to a transportation system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has been supporting human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you don't often hear this level of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems get these complaints, why do they fail every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict a driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform setup; so traffic flows tend to have some moderate uniformity and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent a traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid predators and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places to protect against predators.
Today the only insects that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seemed reasonable because it didn't feel like the Earth was moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical proficiency of their construction.
New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements  like gold, silver and copper  since antiquity, because these occur in nature in a basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter in the same order: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he further theorized that they become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table is very rich in elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also be made with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good tool for a lot of people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil fell out of favor and declined in use.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to reach for a pencil pen.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope, so splitting the nucleus, again, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to decay with a zero or zero touch.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the hidden side.
It is less thick under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is less thick. It was easier for lava to spill out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people act or what challenges them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during the transition from maturation to adulthood.
These theories explore what is it about certain people, what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start to lead their former peers. One edge of the spectrum is an effort to remain a friend.
This type of manager is difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, assess the efficiency of work, assign tasks and demand accountability from people.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done before, and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often such behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high-quality standards as physical teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as a point of contact for their physical team.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local administrators.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal for starting to put the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently used through the functioning departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process, when an organization works together to overcome an obstacle, can lead to a new innovation process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical proof for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, so it narrows the scope of the research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior leads scientists to continue the research.
It's a long-known fact that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries and tumors affect behavior and change some of the mental functions.
The progress of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that were never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
While AI has a strong science fiction feel, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and warfare, and are also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Tours are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take his students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is another great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a web page about their trip to the state capital, and each year a new version of the web page is created, but the old versions remain available for use as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills, and while students often start their blogging experience with a rough grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students become more understanding of the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an instrument that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "may enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own viewpoint on certain problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a host of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south lies the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders think is essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
This population comparison surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens altogether.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it became deeply rooted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama pioneered the Cuban route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what one would consider bullying, and it is not uncommon to be followed, held in the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and don't be afraid to back down (culturally or not, a difference is not necessarily to be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Benimers as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name Casa Branca, but they still left after an earthquake in 1755.
The town was rebuilt by the sultan of Morocco under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is among the most uninteresting places in all of Morocco.
Around the old city center it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of glitter, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city's streets with its magma, mainly in the city center.
Goma offers adequate security, but one must inquire about every visit outside of it to know the status of the battles that are still taking place in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed on the red list of world heritage sites due to the threatening sands of the desert.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts with the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocrodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a different fauna.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most symbolic of all the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry, either to selected South African parks or to all South African National Parks.
The Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the most interesting.
The line of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a brilliant histogram, which is evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross into the waterfront, which is located on the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of the urban vegetation of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land that has been reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the area that the British colonists appropriated, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest sub-marine mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) across the coast further into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not only a mangrove swamp, however; it is home to some of the last refuges of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or marshes.
In 1966, Sundarbans became a nature reserve and it is estimated that in its territory there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, but most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those travelling west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Since the inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and comfortable means of transportation to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 m high, it is 378 m wide and it has two corridors 3.50 m wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 meters away. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the scheduled completion of the Brazilian customs crossings is complete.
The Guaraní were the most notable indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as quasi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", came into existence as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began an era of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo for news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value has been equated to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands you probably won't accept credit cards, but you can take British and American money; ask beforehand which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, change the money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere, and winter in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely freezes, but the wind and humidity combine and therefore one feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities ask that you stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they seem, the bison, the elk, the deer, the bear and almost all the other big beasts are capable of attacking.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a proper distance. Since these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, keep their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other faunas, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and is home to just under 40,000 people.
Apio was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbour was the scene of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting at the town led to the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbours. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of Noth Shore (in the North Haven district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where one can safely swim, and most have the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with shops lined up abundantly along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it's nice and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many good wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better.
It is perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you have concerns.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of flat white coffee, espresso is short black, cappuccino is rich in cream (no foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The juices are expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the instructions of the authorities, follow all signals and safety warnings.
The Kubozoo is a species of sea turtle found in the Indian Ocean, where it is known from the type locality, Kubozoo, near the coast and estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away from them.
Marine crocodiles do not live actively in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a dorm once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may be able to book through such agents other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agents generally provide plans that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reserve if you need time to think about the proposal or to get you other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should, however, be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp on-site and most consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to take a tent seat next to the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have stopped, but there may be parts of the festival where it will be playing until late at night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're sailing the northern Baltic in winter, be careful about the location of the cabin, because going through ice causes a rather terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are visa-free (check conditions).
Casinos usually do their best to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible.
They usually offer special foods, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them inside.
Some places offer alcohol free, but intoxication damages mental capacity and every good athlete is aware of how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who will be driving a vehicle in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is minimal and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, the amount of snow that can block you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or wind, by condensation, by ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the most attractive tourist attraction in Africa and the most remarkable for many visitors.
The word safari is popularly used to mean a terrestrial journey to observe the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and ordinary tools provide good eyesight.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes show themselves to be timid, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a camping safari, walking safari, or walking safari) consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the delay was announced, you're probably in a tough spot.
Cancellation policies are varied, but, in the case of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have borrowed ironing boards and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If an ironing board is not available or if you do not want to wear ironing socks, you may try using a dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause burn damage to it).
There are different ways to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water is sufficient for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiencies and, if you care about that, consider buying the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or carry infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a human by force are generally not counted as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods without payment of taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, sometimes traversing isolated forested areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be very careful: steep slopes, narrow corridors and curvy turns are the most common.
Signal speed limits are noticeably lower than those of the front and rear sections  often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and they are strictly adhered to, even more so than otherwise.
It is notable that mobile phone service is nonetheless much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, for example Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its neighbor to the south, Austria.
There are many fruit bakeries that contain apples all year round, and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular pastries usually go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich cakes, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A dry matter can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spicy dishes, with the tastes favored by Javanese, namely peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Hanging from both sides of the saddle, footrests serve as supports for the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can present safety problems, as the rider's feet could eventually get caught in them.
If, while riding, one falls from a horse with the foot caught by a peg, one could be dragged by a horse that may have run away. To minimize this risk, various safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a sole that is smooth and fairly narrow.
Additionally, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars such that a rider can pull backwards to uncouple a foot from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing area in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer amazing views. Climbers from every corner of the world are constantly creating new routes out of the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one slides down a snow-covered terrain having skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts who are known as Ski Maniacs and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is considered to be a sport from at least the 17th century and in 1861 Norwegians founded in Australia the first ski club for pleasure.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to alpine-style ski hiking or alpine climbing, but it usually does not involve them, as these latter take place on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as if it were a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy backpack on well-maintained roads.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries you have to go through multiple visa and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this respect as if it were one country.
Provided that you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa to each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what goods are antiques. Some tax agencies classify as antiques goods that are more than 100 years old.
Because the definition varies from place to place, in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
So you could consider artisanal goods antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding its trade is important for many other crafts as well.
Even in tradition, not all Sami were engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they lived by fishing, hunting or something similar, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern jobs, and tourism provides important revenue for the Sami people.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Gypsy people, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma.
If a travel warning is issued against the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even though they are directed at their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might be in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simple compared to the more detailed information one may have elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and consists of various types that depend on the location, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hailstorms, excessive precipitation and forest fires are features and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizzards, blizzards, winter storms and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable that travelers be aware of all kinds of risks of extreme weather that affects their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Any visitor to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An online search for a course on hostile media will most likely show the address of a local company.
A course will generally cover much more in detail all the subjects presented here, normally with practical experience.
A course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines on survival in the wild, but there are few such works on war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents with them for return.
The willingness to issue passports without gender (X) or updated documents according to desired name varies from government to government.
Whether other governments are willing to accept these documents varies enormously as well.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery cannot expect to pass the scans without their privacy and dignity being respected.
Surfing is the backward flow of waves that have broken off at a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the diverse underwater formations, the retrograde flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections where a rapid downward flow can form.
Most of the deaths are the result of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than normal.
Try to find a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills or if you've been spotted, you might prefer to wait to be rescued.
The income shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have particular difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
Returning home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of the native culture.
When people first traveled abroad, they probably had patience and understanding, because they knew that travelers needed to adjust to the new country.
People cannot foresee that patience and understanding are also needed in relation to the travelers returning home.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The wailing of sound and light is just like a novel.
The sphinx is set against the background and is the narrator of a long story.
They project the scenes onto the pyramids and then they illuminate the different pyramids.
Discovered in 1819, South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and have the most bases, sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula.The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, whose flooded caldron of a still active volcano provides a striking natural haven.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Having united with the plateau here, the peninsular mountain range later reappears forming the Ellsworth mountain range, which is 360 kilometers long and is bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or mountain range of Sentinel has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak Vinson is 4892 m high.
In remote areas without access to mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you have to be in plain view of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that have need of remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may also inform you about connecting to this service.
For those who plan a sabbatical year, it is becoming increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who finish secondary education, because it gives them a free year before going to university, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you enroll in a seven-year course abroad, it can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you return to your home country.
There will normally be an entry fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating.The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos
You don't need a yacht on the islands and on the lakes.
Even though the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are actually big enough for all kinds of yachts, smaller boats and even kayaking provide a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one in seven or eight Finns own a boat.
Such a popularity is only seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a rather unique statistic (for example in the Netherlands one in every forty people has a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cruise ships additionally include a stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can take full advantage of a few days to visit the historical city, returning at night to the ship to sleep there.
If one disembarks only by the cruise excursions, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying by air can be a scary experience no matter your age or background, especially if you've never flown before or if you've had a traumatic experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of, it's no different from the related personal fears and dislikes that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight can help overcome the fear that is based on not knowing or being in control of things.
Courier companies get good money for fast delivery of goods. Often time is very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repair.
In some lines, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem in other lines and small companies.
If they sent goods by chartered aircraft, on some routes they could spend a few days in the unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to do this faster was to send things as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, you can't send a package without a related passenger, and here you are, seizing the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a very large amount of money for the privilege (or, even better, your company does it for you).
However, it's not cheap: in rough estimates, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth the trouble to look for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were restored between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The major religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial center, situated at a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Between the wide boulevards, the glass-facade buildings and the modern shopping malls, traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century bazaars and old mosques and churches stand out, but the atmosphere of the city is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Harsaldvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the church courtyard there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It is worth spending half an hour to walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its great merits.
Bus line 403 from Scotturb regularly runs to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), which is the site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place of almost incalculable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here and there are even more who had loved ones killed or forced to work to death there, whether Jews or not.
Please behave in the place with as much dignity, solemnity and respect as it fully deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not defile the space with markings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it and almost all speak Spanish.
But most of the posters are only in Catalan, because the law has declared it the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but the unplanned interruptions are announced by an automatic system in a great many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have gained a reputation as egotistical, unkind and proud people.
This is often just an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to keep smooth relations with Parisians is best to behave as if one were "bien élevé" (well-behaved).
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly evaporate if one shows basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the variety of microclimates, diverse terrains and different elevations.
The region is also home to an extremely diverse animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and wild boars, in addition to many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts up to the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide laundry for women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own laundry, especially if it is light-colored.
Similarly, men must wear knee-high pants.
You can also borrow this from the storage room at the entrance, but you don't wash these clothes after each use, and so you may not feel comfortable if you wear these skirts. There is one size for all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mostly pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A popular dinner, especially in summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato and any available additives, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie with the meaning you, always starts with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably also makes it easier to read, but writing becomes a bit more complicated because you need to know if a verb or an adjective is used in the substantiated form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to be particularly noted are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the subsequent vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "cart", while carro means "car".
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
So reading this grammar introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It is needless to say that if one speaks a Romance language, it will make it easier to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close to home that it's not worth learning separately.
In general, pre-modern observatories are today obsolete and remain as museums or educational centers.
Because then light pollution wasn't as big a problem as it is today, they're generally located in cities or at universities, places that are more accessible than those that are built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Since plants look best in their natural environment, don't give in to the temptation to remove specimens, even just one.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting samples will also cause your expulsion without discussion.
Singapore in general is a very safe place and very easy to explore. Once you get there, you can buy almost anything there.
But, since you'll be in the high tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to contend with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the patriarchs from the Bible Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to use goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good topic on which to base holidays.
It would be possible to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, for example, or to go by cruise ship to interesting towns on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also specify routes of known hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity. It celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere around the world have adopted many of the traditions of this holiday.
Traditionally, the Easter night is spent awake in an outdoor place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On the Sabbath night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil and the congregations begin to celebrate at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first came to the archipelago came either swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey and so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, that is, the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark most of the time.
You'll also be able to enjoy the stars, because these regions are sparsely populated and so light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Costumes are the standard work clothes and co-workers address each other by last names or work titles.
Workplace harmony is paramount, as is emphasis on group striving rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers must usually get the approval of their bosses for all decisions made and they must obey the instructions without question.
