I don't want to watch TV anymore because of that.
TV is a performer's fool.
Yesterday I watched a thousand birds on Netflix, but when I said it wasn't particularly funny, I found quite a few scenes of staff laughing and glaring behind the scenes.
It's obviously not funny, but "you're a sold-out performer so you have to laugh at everything you say" is probably a rude joke.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the actor's mood will deteriorate, and the work will be socially unpleasant.
Like the old black companies, the industry is a sporting club, and some entertainers seem to have an egotism that is usually disgusting, and otherwise they can't eat.
On the other hand, it is amazing that the artist himself is always saying "don't scold the artist" when he feels that his work is too difficult.
I know that I have quite a small income before I can sell, but I'm always told that the entertainer's job is like being on top of the crap.
The beauty of their own careers and the ridicule of comedians can only be heard as justification for their excessive position in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in has a rather difficult part, but I feel like the entertainment industry is becoming increasingly unreachable.
I'm sorry for the complaint.
It felt like I was not well enough to go out like Onara.

The buyer will be presented with a sample.
The goods ordered from the Tskumnet Shop were automatically replaced.
Summary: When we ordered a cheaper radio mouse, a wired version of the mouse arrived, and if we wanted a refund, we were told to return it.
It's a marketing problem rather than a PC topic, but whatever you think, it's not satisfactory and famous, so I'll let you write here.
At the Tzkummo Day Sale at the Tzkumnet Shop, which began last Friday, we discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen.
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I ordered it considering the possibility of a price error and the possibility of a page error.
The regular order email arrived, and the next day the shipping email arrived.
In both emails and on my page's purchase history, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
Since there was no error or cancellation notice before the order was shipped, I thought at this point the wireless mouse that ordered would arrive.
The problem here is that a few hours after shipment, an email came in saying "there was a product registration error".
According to the email, 
* The radio version was sold at a discount, but it was actually a wired version.
* Since the wired mouse is already being shipped,
1. refuse to receive and cancel the entire order.
2. Return the mouse salt and return the money.
3. use the wired mouse as it is.
Choose the answer to the question.
The wired and wireless product pages were separated, and the purchase history, email and delivery notes said they were wired, but the wired version was sent automatically instead.
Isn't it bad to be sent something different from the goods you bought, and if you want to return the money, you can send it back from here?
So lend me wisdom, because I want to fight back, whether I accept it or not.

Twice isolated... the only bridge connecting the area with typhoon rains has been blown up. Residents have tripled their food supply.
Mr. Matsunoka from the Highland Region of 矢祭町, 福島 prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan Typhoon had a major impact on the lives of the eight families.
Matsubeshi: "At first it feels like 'Magiya,' doesn't it?"
It felt like it was going to be broken, flooded, or even destroyed in such a short time". The only road to the highland region, the 'Highway Bridge', was flooded by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 11 families and 30 people in the region in isolation.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to use the railway bridge of the JR, which is not normally allowed to pass, for days to transport necessary supplies.
Matsunoka: "I felt the need for transportation, the need for cars to come to the yard, and to walk down the bridge with the car in hand or carrying it over the railroad bridge to come here". The emergency bridge, completed a month later, was flooded by heavy rain less than three months later and again isolated for several days until the temporary bridge was built.
Although the recovery has been underway for more than two years after the disaster, Ms. Matsubane continues to take action to learn a lesson.
Matsunoka: "I think there are about 10 cases.
In the meantime, I'm thinking of making sure that we're making sure that we're getting some sort of two-thirds of the time". Canned, cup-and-dish, and other foods that can be used for a lot of food, are about three times more prepared than before the disaster.
Matsumoto: "I felt again that it was better to save a little or something, because I don't know when a disaster will happen to me, except for other people's business". Meanwhile, the bridge flows through the "unforeseen disaster" of the town of Yatsui.
In order to remember the lesson, the town started its own initiative in 2021 to help.
Director of the Department of Education, Yizeta Town: "We have decided to designate the 12th of October as a day to think about disaster preparedness and to make it a day to prepare for disaster prevention.
I think there has been a greater awareness of the possibility of unforeseen events, than ever before".

Be careful when buying a medieval home!
The catch of the "building situation investigation system" is that it is a "diamond online" - Yahoo! News
● The newly established "building situation survey" system to stimulate the antique housing market is in good shape.
The prices of housing, apartments and condominiums are rising, and the reform market is expanding.
While the coronavirus has increased the trend towards homes, the rising trend towards "station-front" and "massive" buildings, represented by words like "tower", is also likely to be affected by the sharp decline in popularity of relatively cheap new buildings.
 See the image in this article However, compared to overseas, the existing residential share of Japan's existing residential circulation remains still low.
So the Ministry of Transportation (MRT) in 2018 started a so-called inspection called a building situation investigation, aimed at a revised law on the commercialisation of residential buildings, a safe and secure transaction of medieval dwellings.
This is a system where architects familiar with housing check the status and condition of buildings, including the deterioration of the property, and then put it together into a report to inform the buyer.
The State Department explains that the introduction of inspection has benefits for both buyer and seller.
Because the seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting property inspections before a sale transaction, and gives buyers a sense of security.
Perhaps it will also lead to differentiation of competing objects.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that can understand the condition of the old-fashioned housing to be purchased, convincingly buy it, and that, at first glance, is a system that has great benefits.
But under the current system, the dominant authority in building surveys is primarily the seller.
In addition, I would like to note that only notification of the inspection system has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of the mediation is obliged to explain that "in the case of real estate mediation, you can introduce an architect who will investigate the building situation" or "you cannot", but that the implementation itself is not required.
● The risks of vendor-led inspections are of concern; on the other hand, if you look abroad, the antique market is already in place in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the market is booming.
In the early stages of a home purchase, the buyer is required to request a building survey from a professional called an "inspector" or "building surveyor".
For example, in the United States, 70 to 90 percent of all antique residential transactions are inspected by states.
In fact, in that the "buyer" leads the inspection, the main Japanese inspection and its nature are very different from the "seller".
The seller will try to sell the building as quickly as possible, as high as possible, and as soon as possible.
The buyer, on the other hand, thinks he wants to live in peace and security by examining the research and making appropriate adjustments.
Even the same inspection has created a loophole between the two purposes.
Therefore, the following are highlighted as a risk of concern for the Japanese system:
● The scope of investigation for state-mandated vendor-led inspections remains minimal.
● For the inspection firm, the brokerage firm that presents the case may also be the customer.
Therefore, "severe" inspections may be carried out, such as not reporting adverse results to the seller.

銀ブラ while talking 雑学5選 (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! news
"This was once a peninsula.
The evidence for this is that even a little bit of junk can be revealed without a silver lining.
It's interesting to know, but I'd like to introduce you to someone you'd like to share with.
Going up the money table!
First plunge into the Golden Throne.
As the Golden Dawn walks, strange place names, mysterious stone stones, numerous companies, etc., the shadow of history carved by the Golden Dawn landscape remains everywhere.
She walked with her silverware and, in the unexpected silence, said, "This was once a peninsula.
Was the Ginza once a peninsula?
The name of the booming street that created "Ginksu" in all parts of Japan, "Ginksu" in Tokyo's central district.
Originally, "銀座" referred to a silver coinage foundation, which was moved to Edo City in 1612 (now in the city of Shikoku).
It was called "New Exchange Town" at the time, but when it moved to the shell town it became known as the "Genghis Khan" synonym.
By the way, it was once said that the nearest to the Riksdag was a "peninsula" that had risen out of the sea.
From the Edo period to before, from the Japanese subcontinent to the middle of the island, the entrance to the river was inhabited, and from the Japanese bridge to the Ginza, the peninsula known as "Edo Pre-Karaoke".
The tip of the peninsula is now the present-day Genghis Khan.

Who knows, the "pilgrimage to the Holy Land" of the Rings of the Ring.
The annual "Holy Land Pilgrimage" is held in the city, known as "Ringsan Eighting Shrine".
Of the more than 10 shrines, the most visible is the "Sacred Lighthouse" in front of the Kojiki Seat.
The company that stands at the right end of the 歌舞 chair often goes before and after the performance.
Meanwhile, "Dragon Light" is on the roof of the Ginza House, and "Ginza is born" is on the Ginza Terrace on the third and ninth floors of the Ginza.

This temple also includes the worship of the king of the Imams and the goddess of the underworld, although most of the deities offer lightning to the god.
The Fox-housed Lighthouse in front of the Temple was built to benefit the rich grain of rice, which is often grown by farmers.
In turn, in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, it was said that there was a booming business and that beliefs were spreading in every major Japanese city, including the city's most prosperous streets and the city's largest city, the Genghis.

South Korea's Posco International has acquired Senex Energy in the state of Hsinchu, expanded its offshore gas field business.
Post International announced that it has entered into a stock-acquisition agreement with Senex Energy of Hawaii and an investment agreement to acquire Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
As the transaction is still pending at the Seneca Energy General Meeting and approval of local corporations, the acquisition is expected to be completed in March of next year.
The acquisition will be the largest global acquisition, merger and M&A since the merger of Posco International into the Posco Group in 2010.
The acquisition was worth 777.9 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9% respectively.
Posco International explained that the acquisition was decided by considering the sustained increase in demand for natural gas in the energy transition period, and the fact that the hydrogen market was divided between the natural gas-based blue hydrogen and green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, Poco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's 2019 natural gas consumption, and personnel to operate onshore gas fields in the Ho Chi Minh City area.

The knee pain, perhaps a "deformed knee joint" !?
 Medical DOC) - Yahoo! news
Editor's note: Recently, knee pain has continued.
What kind of disease is it possible to have?
Mr. 丸山: The causes of knee pain are various, including injuries, joint rheumatism, and seizures.
Among them, the most common Japanese is "deformed joint disorder".
 Department of Editing: Does this mean that the joints are deformed?
Mr. 丸山: Yes, it is.
The surface of the joints is covered with anthrax, which is responsible for relieving shocks and smoothing joint movement.
However, due to age, obesity, intense sports, and so on, the tendon can become weak or distorted.
As a result, it causes joint deformities and inflammation.
 Editorial Department: Does the degenerative joint develop beyond the knee?
Mr. 丸山: Yes, I have a problem with it.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers, the ankles, neck, waist, toes, and thighs.
However, the most common cases occurring in the knee are called "deformed knee joint" disorders.
Editors: What is the structure of the joints in the first place?
Mr. 丸山: The joint is joined by two bones in a concave plane.
And, the opposite part of these two joints is covered with "joint cartilage", and the surrounding joints are covered with "joint bags".
 Editorial Department: It is a complex structure.
Mr. 丸山: Yes, you are.
Inside the joint sac there is tissue called the salivary gland, which forms the joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfuric acid.
That is why it is said that "Hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfuric acid is better for smoothing knee movements".
 Department of Editing: What symptoms do occur when you have a degenerative joint disorder?
Mr. 丸山: The joint cartilage is sticky and elastic, and it helps prevent bones from directly colliding with each other.
I mean, a role like a pillow.
However, when this is reduced or distorted, it can alter joints, cause inflammation, and cause pain.

The gameplay and gameplay of the 'Kaigi' series, which you can actually experience, is real.
The popularity of the online gambling comic book series 'Kaigi' centred on men has exploded.
One of the flavours of this game is that there are infinite life-threatening games.
Watching photos is a challenge to the Iron Cross!
So this time I want to test the Kaigi game that can actually be played or practiced in a project video.
■Boy is a trap-filled "Boy" of the "Gambling Ring Breaker Kaizis".
In the original, the one-ball, 4,000 yen high rate shocked Kaizie.
This bog was set up with a large trap of "nail-forest" "moving objects" "three-stage crews" that was considered nearly impossible to attack.
But Kaizhi used every means possible, eventually putting a vinyl tank in the building and going out into the wilderness to lower the floor and tilt it, successfully attacking it.
The "Boa" in Kaigi actually appears as a patinco, and many people play it.
Of course, it's not like "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "one thousand yen" or "thousand" or "thousand" or "thousand" or "thousand" or "thousand".
The Iron Cross was a "human race" that was carried out by debtors including Kaiji at a "Starside party" held by the wealthy as a bonus.
The debtor advances and competes for speed while working to prevent falling over a thin iron bone installed 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people can participate and the top two can win prizes, but only four iron bones, insufficient security measures, and a high risk of death.
This high-risk, yet-relevant, railroad crossing was not only developed as a VR game, but also provided a very close experience at the Eagle Bridge, located in the "Miya-Mishi" of the "Oktane Life Park", home of the professional baseball team, the Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge is a 20 meter high iron bridge that spans the building's 7th floor, preceded by a "skybrink" and "victory bridge" that is set up and walks.
Of course, security measures are being taken.
Comedian Koala Storm, who has posted a video on his YouTube channel of "iron crossing in Japan" as a walk on the Eagle Bridge, has become a topic of discussion.
■E-card game of two-player card game  "E-card" 
The Emperor's cards are played with one, the Citizen's cards are played with eight, and the Slave's cards are played with ten, divided into the Emperor's side and the Slave's side.
The game is very well-crafted, with the characteristics of emperor stronger to the citizen, citizen stronger to the slave, and slave stronger to the emperor.
Kaizhi plays against Legan Kawa in the play with a strict rule: "If you lose, you can cut off your own ear".
After the Great Patriotic War, Kaizhi realized that an ear-destroying device like an earphone attached to the ear was being read psychologically by sensing and transmitting pulse rate and body temperature changes, and Kaizhi, who had his ear cut to the extreme, confused and defeated the River Lichen by abnormally cutting his body to the extreme.
The e-card is available in the market and can be purchased on Amazon, etc.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikal posted a video of him competing in E-cards with Fujikawa as Kaizumi in the film, which sparked controversy.
■ Is it possible to taste the Kaigi mood?
In situations like Kaizie, everyone doesn't want to be, but it's true that reading a comic book can only make you feel good.
Through the game, you can feel the worldview.
Step into the new year, kindly and encouragingly, the prefectural ministry of health and well-being is sending out a message to the prefectural ministry of health.
In preparation for the new year, the great horse "" appeared in the prefectural shōgun shōgun shōgun shōgun (山形市) next year's cadet.
Students from the Northeastern College of Art and Technology who designed the building visited the temple for 11 days and performed a service of consecration before the god.
The same company has been commissioning the original painting of the horse from the past year to the students of the artistic college.
This time, the works of three years of artwork painted by nine artists from the Japanese Painting Course, led by Professor Matsuyumi Min, were adopted.
The large paint horse is 3.3 meters wide, the center is about 1.8 meters high.
Turtle House described the painting as "an image of cherries gently pushing their backs into the new year".
The tiger's appearance, stopping and gazing at the cherry blossoms, made her wish "to be able to enjoy the beauty of nature in a rapidly changing world".
The design of the house is also depicted in the painted horse that is commonly distributed.
The great-grandson of the great-grandfather of the Chinese civilization, Chiyū Yū, said, "I think everyone can help overcome difficulties".

Let's think about "the Yūjō I want to live on"  suggestion to the city's 4 high school students workshop: Sanyang News Digital
What town will be Yūjō in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Yūjō City are working on a workshop on "Yūjō I Want to Live on".
As part of the research and policy proposals project of the Yū野SDGs Development Center, a central support organization, it brings together young people's voices and makes recommendations to mayors.
"When is it fun ? "
To the facilitator's question, students respond verbally to "when they're excited about a crowd" and "when they want to play drums".
The first time was on November 13th at the Sunrise Hall.
In the World Cafe, a method of conversation between 18 high school students and the community, each moving around a theme-based "island", they thought of "a nice town", "a livable town", "a city that feels alive".
Each idea is written on a sticker, pasted on a molded paper and arranged.
"A town with a lot of young people is fun". "Transportation, such as trains and buses, is essential for easy living".
If there is anything in common, we will discuss further.
"I thought Yūjō was boring, but cycling along the beach is a charm", says Yūjō Business School's 3-year-old student.
A three-year-old student at Baynan High School (18), who said, "There are few shops, traffic is not convenient, but the nature is good", said that adults who talk to each other seem to notice not only the local challenges but also the charm.
For the second time in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the presentation.
He plans to invite mayors and heads of education to announce the announcement in February next year.
The center's director of education, Dong Yi, says that "as high school students develop a love of their homeland, it can also be an incentive for young people to become subjectively involved in the struggle".

How to find the new wrapper of the store - Yahoo! News
A stove is indispensable in winter, but is it never too late to make a cloth at the base?
You may be able to balance the mirror after you roll it, but you may hear a voice saying, "I don't know".
If I thought there was a cloth-free, rolling stall... I would have found something new.
The "Cottori" stalls are about a meter long and feel a more compact size than the common ones.
When I first saw it, I was like, "Can you be so short and roll?"
On a clear, narrow, long, cut-out fabric is sewn into one piece, the whole being a mesh-like mesh.
The net's eyes are now able to see through the end of the stall.
So, even if the end and end are not connected, it can be wrapped and kept together.
Very lightweight, very warm, and made of free materials.
This year, the topless jersey is popular, but many people will wear it in combination with a stall to keep their shoulders cool.
Having a stool like this would be a great help.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is incredibly interesting.
Get Buck was directed by Peter Jackson.
It's like a lively or even-sized Beatles, fresh and full of freshness......
I'm doing giggles right before the band broke up, but not the dramatic giggles I imagined.
Trying hard to make a point, I'm not sure I'm a bad guy, but I'm not sure, or a little Paul or a crazy George or a quiet, quiet, quiet, and quiet, and always late to make comments or jokes or a talk or a discouraged, discouraged John or a little John or a little John or a little John or a little John or a little Apple of a peach or something, sitting back with a "I'm in trouble" face.
I don't mean to say that we hate each other so much that we fight like that, but there is a very strong sense in the atmosphere of "I can't work with you anymore", and the Beatles were like that, which is a funny legendary breakdown.
And when they started playing in that air, everyone was really talented.
It's a terrible process to go from a little phrase to "what's up?" to "that song".
It's a great moment to be able to get a buck, especially with the title Get Buck.
It's amazing how a nose song like the unmistakable hummingbird gradually becomes that zcha ♪ zcha ♪ and the scene of the lyrics is recorded so well.
You don't want to be seen as this is the way the composition is going.
Of course, everyone is on a diet so watching the performance can make you happy.
Although it still seems like one of the three episodes, the biggest reason for the breakup so far was the impression that the surrounding environment was more than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them would have fun if they started making music, but when the producers and advertisers were talking about the live venue, it was easy to see that the producers and advertisers were saying, "Just the Beatles from the world's first!" and then saying, "Oh, they're getting out of their own hands".
Well, since the documentary also includes interpretations by the director, Peter Jackson may have felt that way.
I also thought that it might be because Paul is being monitored so that there are so many scenes where Paul is seen as a villain instead.

Several tornadoes and major damage in the United States were caused by the effects of the off-season heat and cold weather.
Between the hours of 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. local time (Tuesday) tornadoes have struck the southern United States.
During this period, the atmosphere became very unstable, and clouds of clouds developed rapidly, due to the effects of a strong cold southward downward from a place that was record warmth.
In the southern United States, warm air flowed from the southwest, setting a record high temperature.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature has risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.
At a place where this record warmth was present, near 5500m above sea level, as the extreme cold below 30°C dropped southward, a large temperature difference created an active front and clouds developed rapidly in a way that would have led to a frontal movement.
Tornadoes appear to have occurred in succession around the area.
The southern United States is originally a tornado-prone region, but during the high season, from early summer to summer, there is little damage during this time.
Tornado warnings issued in one day during the winter season reached nearly 150 times, a record high.
The U.S. Ocean Weather Agency has reported more than 400 tornadoes and other types of typhoons in the past 10 days (Friday) local time.
From this, we can see that there are two concentrated areas that are broadly separated by the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improvement of the Futuda scale) indicates the strength of the tornado, reaching the third strongest of the six levels, EF3, and it is believed that a typhoon immediately after 70m/s was blowing.
Depending on future research, it may be possible to determine EF45.
In Japan, the Japanese version of the Japanese improved fōtōda scale (JEF) is used to adjust the situation of Japanese architecture to improve fōtōda scale.
JEF3, equivalent to the current US tornado, is likely to occur in Japan, where wooden houses are likely to collapse.

In his comments on the tornadoes in the Midwestern and Southern United States, President Biden described it as "one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history" and described it as "a mysterious sight".
CNN TV reported on the incident.
Biden stressed that "as a federal government, we will do everything we can".
"The full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost, is not yet known", he explained.
More than 100 deaths have been feared.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
While records of the extent of tornado damage remain of 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in 1925 in Missouri and other states, meteorologists at USCNN have estimated that this time the largest was about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, where the damage was severe, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas trade war was also severely damaged.
Although 110 people were employed at the time, the building was destroyed and left untouched.
In the dark, a woman who could not move under a roughly 1.5 meter thick fence felt the weight of the lifeguard searching the fence, and called for help from her mobile phone via Facebook live broadcast.
In addition to the screams of women calling for help, the live broadcast also played screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You", which another woman is believed to have sung while crying to stir up terror.
Amber Brown, a convenience store owner in Mayfield, was safe and quiet in her home's basement with her five-year-old son, who was hidden in the tornado alert.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrible sound, like an earthquake that something more was exploding".
A Mayfield City Police officer said, "The search continues until no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months, years that will be, but I don't know how many months, years that will be".

It has long been said that different people think differently about the rating system of the star system.
Foreign countries are scoring five stars as a benchmark, while Japan claims to be scoring three stars as a neutral plus/minus.
At the point of reference, there is already a difference of 2 stars, and 4 stars have a completely different meaning when they say "there is a reduction element" and "not a title but a good one".
Since "work without defect" and "work of the highest standard" are the same when you consider five stars, I think if there is such a tendency, then it would be a systemic flaw that does not suggest the meaning of the star, but because such a system is currently being used, you should not place a star rating.
So if you try to challenge those who claim this kind of argument with Steam's two-way rating, the argument will be broken.

A long journey by a family that has taken environmental protection efforts to the Chinese border.
(Kato Yoru: Hong Kong BusinessFind Asia Business Consultant) China, with a vast landmass, is also important in terms of biodiversity, the species of mammals that live in it are the world's first, and the species of plants are the third in the world.
Some regions, which are self-governing, recognize the value of biodiversity and are not only protecting the environment as governments do, but also promoting environmental activism.
Siasapanna, Yunnan Province in southwestern China, is one such region.
Li Li Lian, who is now active as an actress, is a resident of the region bordering Laos and Myanmar, and a large ethnic minority in Thailand, with roots shared by the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is the main source of the Mekong River.
The Sissapanna (Taiwanese: 西双版納族) Autonomous Region covers only 0.2% of China's total land area, but is home to about 25% of the species of wildlife and 20% of the species of plants.
This time, I have told Li果, who is involved in environmental protection activities in SiSapanna, about the activities that have taken place on the ground.

What was the motive of this?
Mr. Li, our environmental protection campaign "天" has been active since 2000.
The inspiration for this was my husband Joseph Margraf.
My husband, who is from Germany, came to Cezapanna for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only area of rainforest in China, and it boasted a considerable biodiversity.
But, at the same time, economic development was slow.
For this reason, large-scale deforestation of the tropical rainforest has been carried out in the past to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber that was scarce in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to work on restoring natural resources and researching biological resources.
And then I met and married a reporter here.
― ― Before that, Lee was not interested in nature conservation? ―
Mr. Li, I am from Sichuan, but I was not interested in the importance of the rainforest or the meaning of biodiversity.
So she started to push her husband and project forward without knowing it.
I don't see people with a nice face or a tall face, but I do see people with a great aura sometimes, so why do you think?

The person must have a strong sense of self-confidence within.

 Thinking about the importance of psychiatric visiting nursing - Today's visiting nursing is over.
I have been a visiting nurse for a long time, because I have bipolar disorder, but I feel that I am getting along longer and have a very good relationship with the nurse from the visiting nursing station I am using now.
We talk about a lot of things every week.
Of course, the pharmaceutical administration will do the necessary things, but above all, I realized with today's visiting nursing how important it is to have a pleasant communication for people with mental illness.
Today, we're also talking about gossip about gender differences and gender issues.
We also talk about the sexual desires of men and women, why she got divorced, or can we do that with a nurse?
Sometimes, though, I dress up as a woman.
I've heard from people I know that in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, a nurse who is unable to work in the ward will come and provide only administrative assistance, or that an occupational therapist in visiting nursing will come and direct you from above, "because you are doing medical care".
I am using a small visiting nursing home run by a social welfare corporation, but I think she is a really good nurse who can face Frank, as opposed to me with mental illness.
She's a beautiful person by the way, and she's smiling.
Many of you are receiving psychiatric visits or are considering receiving them.
Visiting nursing is very helpful for people with mental illness.
If approved by the doctor, we are happy to accept it.
And then, let's choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I have had to cancel contracts from here because I was not necessarily opposed.

South Korea's patent on hydrogen technology, a fifth of China's ... "The implementation of the hydrogen economic roadmap is delayed" (中央日報日本語版) - Yahoo!ニュース
The South Korean government has announced a 2019 hydrogen economy roadmap.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation by 2022 and to operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was 6000 won per kilogram (about 577 yen).
But by November's standards, fuel cell cars are only 27 percent of the target level (about 17,000).
The schedule for the deployment of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure and the target of 38% (about 117 cases) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilometer, which is not much different from the time of the roadmap announcement, is 8,400 watts.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economic roadmap has significantly lowered the target values.
The National Coalition of Economists (NECE) on the 12th of July released its report "The current state of the hydrogen economic ecosystem and policy direction".
According to the report, it is a fact that the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are largely dependent on the United States and Japan, among others.
Carbon fiber is the core material for fuel cell vehicles, and is supplied by the fuel cell carrier, the carbon fiber is supplied by the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, the fuel cell carrier, and so on.
The number of patented hydrogen technologies in the six countries that lead the world hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (after 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production, fuel cell, Korea ranks fifth in the world in 2014-2020 cumulative terms.
But the full-length report stated that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, meaning in fact, they are the lowest of the competing countries".
The ranking of patents by country is in the order of China, the United States, the EU, Japan.
Since 2017, China has been pushing the gap since it surpassed the United States at number one.
The number of patents registered in 2020 has surpassed Korea's Japan (974 patents) by 1,033 to number four, while China's 4721 patents are at a 22 percent level.
The National Strategic Technology Council proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with significant reductions in equipment investment and R&D costs".

US aid weapons and ammunition arrived in Ukraine and troops were also training.
(CNN) U.S. Department of State officials reported that by 12 January, equipment containing small arms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
Military aid totals 60 million euros, and at the beginning of the year, the last equipment, including four radar systems to identify launch sites, such as mortars, will be delivered to Ukraine.
According to US Department of Defense spokesman Kirby, these aid measures included lethal weapons such as anti-tank missiles "Jaberin".
The military support is intended to strengthen Ukraine's national defense capabilities, such as the military buildup that Russian forces are advancing against the Ukrainian border.
The U.S. has also increased its alert to Russian military movements, consulted with NATO member states, and devised a response plan in case Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden approved the arms assistance on September 1 of this year when President Zelensky of Ukraine visited the White House.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine this year reached about $450 million.
Since Russia forcibly annexed the Ukrainian-Crimean peninsula, the total aid amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the state of Florida sent troops to the United States as part of a multi-national joint training program supported by Ukraine.
According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special operations forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a matter of confidentiality during the operation.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on 7 July, but also had a close conversation on the situation in Ukraine.
The United States has also shown willingness to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The "revision" of the inheritance-gift tax process that makes lifetime gifts "forbidden" directly hit the former chairman of the SDP's tax commissioner, Ghanliming!
The first feature of the December 18 issue of Weekly Diamond was, "Talking in the family at the end of the year!
It is a lifetime gift-in-heritage technique".
While the debate on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax is ongoing, the concerned 2022 tax reform agenda has been seen as a step forward, but in the near future, lifetime gifts, the royal method of dealing with inheritance tax, are likely to become "prohibited".
How will the rules of succession change?
Along with the direct hit to the former chairman of the Democratic Party's tax preparation committee, Ghani, and the House of Representatives, he will teach the basic principles of gift and inheritance, from taxation to tax savings, for timely, convenient, and in-kind gifts throughout the year.
(Diamond editorial department 宮原啓彰)
● To the "prohibitors" of lifetime gifts, from property owners to urban entrepreneurs, "to advance a thorough consideration of the taxation of inheritance and gift tax in terms of a more integrated approach to taxation, the construction of a neutral tax system for the choice of the time of transfer of assets".
The 2021 fiscal reform agenda, which he and his party announced last year, caused a great deal of unrest not only among the wealthy but also among the middle class.
Because, what that means is that by changing the inheritance rules and making "forbidden" the "lifetime gift", the royal method of taxation, it means that the inheritance tax will be increased.
The rules for tax avoidance of progressive inheritance taxes are to "reduce taxable property".
The most powerful gift of life, the gift of life, has been widely used by wealthy people, of course, even by businessmen who are subject to inheritance tax at a lower rate because they have a home in the three metropolitan areas.
The debate over "integration of inheritance and gift tax" has been heated in the midst of this.
Although the 22nd Annual Tax Reform Agenda, which was announced on 10 December and was concerned about the fastest implementation, was presented as a step forward in the "revising of the current inheritance tax system and the calendar year gift system", the policy towards integration was re-introduced in more advanced texts such as "The non-taxation of gift tax measures are a system that does not require any taxation on the transfer of assets within the family within a limited amount of time, and are being continually reviewed".
In an interview with the editorial department, the former chairman of the DPRK's Taxation Survey, former chief executive officer Ghanliming, said:
"The most important thing is to keep the tax burden the same whenever and wherever the property is transferred.
I'm currently simulating what kind of problem (by integration) arises". If the quickest correction were made, the remaining chance of a lifetime gift would be three times greater.
If not, it is certain that in the near future, there will be a major move towards the elimination of lifetime gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance and gift tax change?

My Right Brother is on the air since January 10, 2022 on the ground.
The FOD has decided that the original drama 'My Right Brother' will be aired on Fuji TV from late night on January 10, 2022.
The film, which is an original adaptation of the 2018 anime series of the same name by Moriyatsuki, which was serialized in the magazine's 'BE-LOVE' from 2018, is a pure love story about men and women who have been carrying on in the past.
The main character's role is Hailey, and the heroine's role is played by Valley Flowers.
As a college student, Richard meets his former employer, Hayley.
Hailey, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep well on the shoulders of the rich.
Richard is attracted to Haley, who has a face similar to his brother who was separated by his parents' divorce, but is not one reason why Haley is a murderer?
The drama 'My Right Brother' will be broadcast on terrestrial radio from January 10!
I hope those who haven't seen FOD will enjoy it, and those who have already seen it will get to know the work better as they get to know the development and see the complex psychological portrayal of Hayley and Riley, and the way two people struggle and change.
I'm glad you're enjoying the original fan base as well.

The team that won the NFL 1 game pass 3 times, the players, how did they feel about it?
In this game, Jones' pass to the Patriots was only three times.
This was the fewest passing game in the NFL in the last 50 years since the Bills recorded two passes in Week 3 of 1974 against the New York Jets.
The 1974 Bills had an unusually talented RB named O.J. Simpson, who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history last season.
Bills had overwhelmed the Jets with a run by Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots were carrying out such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, not in the same latitude as the Northeast Passage.
And on this day, after a temperature of almost one degree Celsius, a wind of 18 meters was blowing, snow was blowing before the game.
The Bills were only local, and they didn't change their play options much.
Running 25 times against 30 passes.
Allen's pass was 15/30 yards and 145 yards.
There was no intercept, and it never went out.
In the 10 offensive series, there were four Red Zone breaches and scoring machines.
Especially since the end of the third quarter, the team has advanced to the Red Zone three times in a row.
But in those three times, FG only took three points from one.
Goal of the final match of the match - pre-defense.
The Bills, who were four-point chase, were third and 14th, finishing with a penalty of 3rd and 9th.
18 yards to the goal.
In 3rd & 14th, QB Allen, surrounded by a dash of Patriots defense, came out of his pocket and flowed right.
He then threw a pass to endzone's Tedson Knox, but failed.
In this play, the right-handed outfielder, S.W.R. Stefan Diggs, walked over the Sharon Acrosse and was free in front of the end zone, but Allen apparently didn't see it.
4th & 18th, Allen was aiming for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran from outside the left end zone, but the pass ended in failure when he was beaten by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in front of his hands.
Bryant was covering Bills' WR-Call Beasley with a man-to-man, but on the way he saw Allen's movements and he would let go of Beasley and react to the passage.
Allen, who missed two receivers, threw a pass to the end zone twice.
The pass of the 4th down may have been decisive, but the 3rd down didn't have to be TD's target.
We should take the first down in two plays.
It was still two minutes before the fourth and short, so Allen's ability to run his own runs should have been revived.

A sponge is a sponge.
No matter how often they are replaced, the sponge is probably not being replaced as often as recommended.

The United States Department of Agriculture has warned that if the leaves start to rub, become scarred, or cracked, the planks should be replaced.

Even if you try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, thinking that the BIOS is broken, it never ends.
According to MSI's blog, it seems to end in about five minutes, but not an hour.
The reason for the question is whether the USB memory you tried is too old and used to replace the SD card.

By the way, Japan is a good place to be.
If Japan is a country, it is.

It's better to say early, "Why am I the only one who's a dumpster?"
So if it comes to being an outsider, it doesn't matter, you'd better say it's just not comfortable.
I don't think I ever dreamed of having a bad mind with a good chance.
I was living abroad on the way, but Japanese travelers who went abroad, including me, mistakenly assumed that people who didn't like the upper-class religious practices could stay in the country and say anything to the locals.
If Westerners look like they're purely evil, I think they're doing it with a kind of sweetness or a sense of humor.

I only judge by translated text, as I have only a little knowledge of English.
I think the translated text feels a little different from the text, but it's a level of understanding and playfulness that I can play at (I think I'd better just feel this way and ask others).
This level of translation is often seen in games made abroad, and I feel that if you were a small company, you would be translated well.
I think that a non-Japanese native understands the subtle nuances of Japanese, and can even be reached by studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if the Japanese are looking for a level where they don't feel any difference, it's probably best to look for another one.

The battle is the practice of exploring the 'Ghost Destroyer's Blade'.
"Equal exchange of effort" is a human hymn.
Among recent teen comics, the most striking feature of the "Ghost Slaying Blade" is that it is "very much practiced".
The theory is that, in most cases, there is no battle, and that the practice of exercising at dawn and dusk is not popular with readers.
That's also evident from the fact that even in the same jump comic strip, 'ONE PIECE', when a piece of wheat was left untouched, it took two years of practice, drawing only touch and the rest of it flying fast.
Well, one of the attractions of the Wampie is the eccentricity of the land around which it walks; "stay and practice in the same place" is not always the same.
Now, the practice of the protagonist of "Ghost Sniper" Anjingiro began when he sat down to beg for life and tried to take his own life, saying to the hero who saved his life, "Don't let anyone else take the right to kill and take!"
The weak have no right or choice but to be forced by force to surrender to the strong.
That said, the recent introduction of the "guardian" who trains aspiring Ghostbusters to join the squad is the kindness of the hero.
The first contact between Anjirō and kataka was when asked, "What do you do when your sister eats a human?" and the answer was "Justice is slow".
Even among fans, it is a story-telling, one-on-one, and unrealistic interaction.
Taking a ghosted sister with you implies the possibility that a moment may come when you will be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that the initiative is a practical one.
But he took an amateur anarchist who had not yet practiced and led him to a narrow foggy mountain, and by dawn he had to descend to the top of the mountain and leave the falls.
The mountains are thin and airy, full of traps, pitfalls, and traps, and almost die before they enter the practice.
Yet, with the sharp sense of smell, the human hand-crafted vanna smells like a little bit of a "main character's fix" and barely avoids it.
Still, the essence of making Anchorage say "I don't get physically up to speed enough to avoid all of it!" is that it's a ghost-killing thing.
The normal human being, without any support, suddenly becomes stronger, or awakens, and only then can "the power and skill that has been refined so far" be used in its true potential.
"Equal exchange of effort", which is not worth much to those who have done their best, and which is not rewarded for hard work, is a human hymn, unlike a ghost with unfounded supernatural powers, and a hard-working rule consistent with the work.

I think there are many of those people.
Is it going to be hard?
Anyone who works as a part-time worker, who wants to work full-time, who works in a store and has a hard time?
No, I don't think so in particular.
In that case, it doesn't seem to be "hard" as I think it is.
Moreover, I think it is "narrow" to draw up plans to somehow achieve more than just a profit by the minimum amount of work.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea has created a new "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile phones, "emphasizing user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! news
Samsung Electronics continued to integrate the CE and IM departments into set departments, decided to name the company DX ((Device Experience) and announced on 12 December that it would reflect this in the end-of-year organizational transformation.
The aim of enhancing user experience through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances, can be read.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that its newly launched DX division, which will be merging the CE and IM divisions, will be from business divisions such as VD, Visual Display, Consumer Electronics, Medical Devices, MX, Mobile Experience, Networking, and more.
A Samsung Electronics spokesperson explained that "the name change reflects the medium-term business structure and future-orientedness, as well as the strengthening of global leadership".
It also emphasized the idea that products such as TV, appliances, smartphones, and communication devices, of course, can easily provide consumers with an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect customer needs.
The introduction of integrated leadership systems was reflected in the name of the company, as well as the strategy to create synergies across the organization and build a differentiated product and service base beyond the boundaries between organizations.
Samsung Electronics is already devising a strategy through the "Multi-Device Experience" conference to allow users to freely access content and services through the interconnection of devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).
Does 1500 BCE mean 1500 BCE?

The concept of BC (Before Christ) has become increasingly associated with the term "Before Christ" but has been used to describe the recent years as B.C.E. based on the idea that there is a concern for people outside the Christian faith.
BCE is short for "Before Common Era" (before the Common Era).

The driver of the trailer was unwell, unconscious, and was not aware of 24 crashes. - Yahoo! News
In the accident in Aichi Prefecture's Chōda Prefecture, where 24 cars collided, it was found that the driver of the trailer arrested and sent for inspection was not ill, but was thought to have been involved in an accident due to some kind of negligence.
On the morning of 10 May, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on National Road 41 in the small town of Pasadena, 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested 54 suspected gunmen who were driving a trailer on the charge of causing injury to a 71-year-old man in the first crash and sent them to check-in on 12 Jan.
The tractor of the suspect continued to step on the brakes after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that the suspect had temporarily lost consciousness shortly after the accident.
However, according to investigators, it was found that the suspect was not ill, but that some sort of negligence was the cause.
Police are searching the victim's home and investigating the circumstances at the time.

The first episode of the comic book series The Week Before (June) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Super-Human Olympics, which began with three volumes, ended with four volumes!
Unlike the previous installment, which was shot simultaneously from opening to semi-final, which focused on just one game, the new plot is full of new tricks!
● 'Kinn肉マン' 4 volumes  Review post name ぬまX★★★★★★★★★★★★★5 stars) ● Superhuman propulsion is already starting right before the game!
These four volumes are, quite literally, a detailed account of the final match of the game between the Chickenman and Robin Mask, but I would like to emphasize first of all that this is not a book that is solely about the ring game.
Starting with the signature style, the hand-to-hand combat, the training landscape, and so on, it's not a very good game, but it's never boring.
This feeling of gradually rising tension in the beginning of the First War of the Century is certainly linked to the rising tension in the readership, and it is surprising that even this period was a really calculated performance.
And, one more thing to not miss before the important final, is the three-game series between Terrieman and Lammman.
While it is a fancy match card, I like the fact that Lamman was behind the scenes before the game and said to the chickenman poster, "From now on, I'm jealous!"
And trying to beat the chops.
But the tellerman who passed by by accidentally grabbed the knife and stopped, silently and silently, and the scene was just about to break apart.
What's amazing about this is that both of them are already losing, and there is no longer a chance to fight the henman in this tournament.
But there is such a thing as a boring rumor about the chicken man.
When you are shown this, you cannot help but think of a future activity!
That's what it's like to be a character, and it's still a painful scene for me as a cartoonist!
The two fights ended without much of a fight, but the famous scene was the crying cry of the Lamenman after the match.
"Don't be surprised by the strength of God's good fortune for the Kinnaman!
It is a sequel to .
Is this a spectacular metaphor for the work itself, that even readers have felt that Kinman was ultimately victorious, in a way that he could not lose because he was the protagonist?
But by making Lammanman make this statement, Mr. Yue-Tang has stabbed himself to the ground, preventing him from using his hand.
With this phrase, the reader asks, "Well, then can a chickenman really knock down a robin with his own power?
How can you ? "
You can also imagine the unprecedented development, and from another literary point of view, this is the same meaning as the master of the craft, who has imposed a binding upon himself.
This was a remarkable achievement.
I think it's definitely one of the big points of this volume.
