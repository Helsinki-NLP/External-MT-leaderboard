Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the deadline and order of payment of goods (work, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve the very sharp problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Another two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not get payment for the already executed state and municipal contracts, was universal.
At the same time, the President of Russia gave the order to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem on special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not deal with unfair customers who signed unfinanced contracts, attempted to escape from paid obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systematic in the country.
Since 2015, in the interests of the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payments on public orders by the prosecutor's office, 9,7 thousand submissions have been submitted, according to the results of their consideration to disciplinary responsibility, 4,5 thousand officials have been attracted, to the administrative - 533, to the investigative bodies for the organization of processal checks, 75 materials have been submitted, 46 of which have been incurred criminal cases.
In the end, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was paid.
And these huge amounts accumulated far from the result of the non-payment of billions of contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs have led to basic debts to much more modest amounts.
This is a characteristic case.
The head of a small company won a competition for social transport services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his turnover funds, fully fulfilled his obligations, but the money placed in time did not receive.
The result is an increasing financial cum of debts on wages, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help to the prosecutor's office.
Now, in a number of regions, the problem has been reduced as much as possible.
However, in the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt on state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office works in a manual anti-crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally holds exit meetings with the representatives of the local authorities, on which all the offences opened by the Prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are subjectly discussed.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Crimes in Part of the Establishment of Administrative Liability of Officials of the Customer for Violation of the Term and Order of Payment of Goods (Works, Services) During Purchasing for State and Municipal Needs" was signed last week by the President of the Russian Federation.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the General Prosecutor's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences by an article, which provides a fine from 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the period and order of payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal purchases.
And if the official has already been sentenced to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All the prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already received an order to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Group announces warning on movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Progress of Colour Population has published a warning for colourful people traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policy and racial ground attacks.
The group’s statement sounds as follows: “The National Association’s warning for travelers to promote the progress of the colored population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be careful and be more cautious when traveling across the state in connection with a number of doubtful racial land events that have recently occurred throughout the state and brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of Color Population, to announce a movement warning the group was encouraged by the recently adopted law in Missouri, which made it harder for people to win charges related to discrimination, as well as the fact that the state law enforcement authorities disproportionately often choose minority representatives as their objects.
People are being violated by human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are killed and killed," Rod Chapel, president of the National Association to promote the progress of the colorful population of Missouri, told Kansas City Old.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of this kind made by the organization to the United States.
The group referred to such incidents as the humiliation of black students of the Missouri University and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished gasoline during a trip to the state, and the police of the state of Missouri arrested him without submitting charges for the crime.
The warning also mentioned a recent report from the Missouri State Prosecutor's Office, according to which the chances of being stopped on the road for black drivers are 75 percent higher than for white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning is to keep people aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in a way or in a way, whether they take the money with them for a bet or tell their relatives that they’re traveling throughout the state.”
According to the latest data of the FBI program on hate-based crimes reporting, in Missouri in 2015 100 hate-based crimes were recorded, making the state the 16th in the state in the number of such crimes.
The movement warning is also a response to the new law of the state of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to raise a case against a legal entity in connection with housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers across Texas and Arizona after these states adopted new immigration control laws, according to which local law enforcement authorities were ordered to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, should increase the number of racial checkings.
Transport warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have applied to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people killed in Egypt police patrol shooting
Unknown people shot a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All the injured were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car, after which two armed people in the car opened fire on law enforcement officials.
One of the offenders was arrested, the second man escaped.
Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free luggage for non-return air tickets
The head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC television channel that it is "positive" to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of the free baggage chain for unreturn air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions in which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has the luggage,” he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for the transport of upper clothes and mobile phones in the hand warehouse.
“It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and to declare that, saying that it will not have any relationship with the upper clothes, the clothes, the mobile phones, the iPad or even any computer,” said Rosturism’s head.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law that provides airlines with the right to exclude the standard on free baggage with non-return air tickets.
It is about the fact that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of the luggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate Baikal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin on a meeting on the protection issues of Baikal said that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been exposed to extreme pollution.
He ordered to identify sources of financing, plans and executives for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned to carry out a complete recycling of polluted territories.
“It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the cleaning structures of most of them are drawn out,” the president said.
He also added that the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia should conduct a check for the detection of environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of natural waste and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of the holiday.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in a row to check, here too the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he said.
Previously, the Prosecutor’s Office a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects under environmental supervision.
On June 15, Vladimir Putin in the course of the direct line declared the need to amend the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural territories of a special regime of protection.
About the problems with the conduct of economic activities he was informed by the residents of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskaya immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarificing the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are linked to a whole number of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economics proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in Yugoslavia
In the village of Sossva members of the community of representatives of indigenous minor peoples of the North "Rahtynia", together with the inhabitants of the Berezov region take part in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the saint Nicholas Miracle.
Its location is a river shore, the temple will be well seen from a distance, so it will serve as a roadlight for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now the crop is installed, the church clocks are available.
The Igrim REB fleet provided transport accompaniment.
The temple is named in honor of St. Nicholas the Miracle, as it is honored by the Orthodox Church as the protector of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sousse, the fishing industry gives the settlers work, feeds them.
Local residents wait for the temple to open their doors, and children even write about it in school works as a local landmark.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why are the laws respected in Singapore?
I’m talking to the local businessman Chang, sitting in a snack room in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after the other, but the chicken is carefully stored in the iron box with him from the office.
After the conversation ends, the businessman goes to the nearest urne - a hundred meters to it - and throws the bears there.
The penalty for waste in a public place is 500 local dollars, according to Chang.
You know, I have a simple reflection from childhood: you can’t throw a fancy from a dessert on a bridge, you’re immediately punished.
Now all over the world video cameras.
And indeed, Singapore's routes in the center of the city are clean, as in a museum.
Chang tells us that three months ago, a 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted a graphite wall of an old colonial building.
The court acknowledged the man guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a pork.
What ?
Imagine yourself.
He got ten wooden shots on the bears and spent a week in jail.
Physical punishment is not rare.
How the highest level of life and incredibly strict laws are combined in Singapore, the AIF observator understood on the site.
“There’s no one thinking about abolishing the death penalty,” explained the lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been cracking on the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person carries a large lot of drugs or trades them, he has a wheat.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was arrested at the Changi airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even Pope Rome.
The man was eventually hanged.
After that, narcotic curators carefully travel our country on the side.
The case is as follows: in Singapore it is stipulated that the laws are obliged to observe ALL in a row, not only the humble and wealthy people.
It doesn’t matter who you are a millionaire, a vice prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: if you find a half-kilogram of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet tables with a lot of warnings, you simply wonder how much in this city-state of prohibitions!
For example, it is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the prescription of a doctor (!)
The tourist at arrival will not remove the grape, but it is worth attaching the "cover" to the subway, a fine in 1 thousand local dollars.
In four days I met two men with white tables on their neck: "I was rubbing."
In addition to the penalty, for abandoned by the urna, the curtains are often sentenced to a "link to the palaces": a week to remove parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pay the "criminal", who forgot to wash water in the public toilet, and when trying to deal with a small need in the lift of the residential house operates a special detector - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the quite exotic laws - the ban on the feeding of dolls on the street, the public performance of songs and even the excessive swimming of the room plant (!): it is believed that plenty of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers can’t carry the fires in the metro, otherwise they will be punished by 5,000 Singapore boxes.
In general, there is a thought: whatever you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case at all - Muhammad Kabir-Kadharia, the owner of the local tour agency, is trying to inform me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and for the past twenty years I have not seen anyone being attracted for their violation.
Why are they preserved?
The citizens do not relax.
The basic rules are followed untouchably.
Let’s say, if a minor is sold cigarettes in the kiosk, then everything in the chain will be punished: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the breacher himself will be hit by palks on the “back” and the seller will also be thrown out and placed in prison.
It is because of such strict laws that criminal offences in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Even in the 1970s we had chaos on the roads - the drivers ignored the lights, ride as they wanted, sitting drunk behind driving.
After a year of punishment, everything calmed.
Now the driver, drinking a portion of whisky, knows: if they stop, the police will not leave for the pickup, they will impose a fine in the amount of the price of the apartment and for years they will be sent for the prison.
For many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson named Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - guests from the United States were scared by the general wealth of the inhabitants, "a terribly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
Deck, such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and it should not be so in principle.
The first days in Singapore and you’re really afraid to throw a paper on the trail, you’re catch up if you’ve entered the metro with ice cream.
But then you arrive in the "Little India" district, and suddenly - "the breakdown of the template": the bus stops rolling plastic glasses.
“How is it?” you are surprised.
The singaporeans are smiling.
Everything is.
Not for every such “crime” will be caught in place, but you must know: if you are counted, you won’t get rid of it – for you have violated the law.
Most often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Hoshimina, Vietnam, I was moving very carefully – motorcyclists often catch out of the hands of tourists smartphones and cameras.
The centre of Paris is full of dirty bombs and requests.
In our streets, not everyone is trying to throw waste into the urns.
Singapore is the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth, thanks to a set of dragon punishments and unpleasant (at the death penalty) laws.
You think.
This is the human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was trapped by driving until they began to punish.
The main thing in Singapore is not penalties, but voluntary law enforcement.
And we have to think that in Russia people would also be happy with the clean streets, the lack of waste in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Body punishment – thank you, don’t need.
In the rest, the laws of Singapore are at least worth to look at them.
No holy thing?
The White House targeted the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of a regime change is when it begins to fight statues.
The Americans understand this not worse than everyone else – from that point the theatrical collapse of the statue of Saddam Hussein on the Fields Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump government, without a doubt knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic tower over the Statue of Freedom during an intense dispute with CNN journalist Jim Akosty about the president’s proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
To be honest, Miller did not try on the statue itself.
A lot of the owners of walking ships and the artists that represent the Statue of Freedom would link him if he tried to do so.
But he sought her meaning, and especially that meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the conclusion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
“I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you’re talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom.”
Miller correctly stated the facts, but as he himself said, it is actually not about history.
This is about the current sound of the stunning words of Lazarus, the only in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, /Your crowd dreaming to breathe freely, /Unfortunate throwings of your abundant shores."
Never "unfortunate removal" has been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literature - he made it clear that in America Trump is not waiting for these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who struggled to put her words on the statue after her death – knew very well that they were doing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics through a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: the Mother of the Expelled.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a devastating attack on American nazism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right even to change it back.
Rash Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist, who announced Trump’s arrival, in 2010 argued that Freedom doesn’t invite anyone, rather it’s a early neoconservative, carrying the flame of America to the dark world: “Freedom goes forward.
It carries the fake of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The facel is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Contrary to the usual, Limbo really got in the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends exclusively on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as wealthy, unhappy, but hopeful people on the vessels after a long and often heavy flight.
This literally means looking at the world with the eyes of people seeking asylum and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is answered by words of hope and hospitality that they dream to hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their lightning is not needed to light the way, but to burn the hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Championship 2017: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the UK team.
Elyde Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scots in the UK.
Neil Blake, play director of the British Federation of Light Athletics, said that a 16-person Scottish part of the team at the World Cup will make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
The record number of Scottish light athletes was selected for the London Championship 2017 which begins on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is born in Scotland, and the British Federation of Light Athletics should take this into account.
"We know this and we're trying to understand and will support them as long as they have potential," Blake said.
“I’ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it’s related to what they’ve done.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics believes that with what they have done, we need to work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: with what they have done, you have to work.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why the circumstances were so, but it’s quite brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish light athletes claim for medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5000 m; and Elyde Doyle team chose its captain.
“Elyde is humiliating.
Her captain speech was great,” says Blake.
“Many athletes, whether they’re Scots or not, and from where they live or train, came out of this room, feeling proud of the victory.
The passion and sincere feelings that Elyde put into her were wonderful.”
The owner of the Silver Medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which on its fifth World Championship will run a distance of 400 meters with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team are "incredible."
The previous record in the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Forward is Laura Moore, a medium-distance run specialist, who beat five British and two European records last year.
It will run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will participate in the 1500m race, is another Scottish man to pay attention to: behind him a successful season, in which there were victories in the brittish team's selection competitions and in the annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world championship when, in addition to her, the only Scotland in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she’s “incredibly proud” that so many of her peoples not only entered the team, but in some cases will claim a medal and fight for the outcome to the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was in any case a great honor, but knowing that your colleagues voted for you and chosen you - for me it's a very special thing," she added.
“Naturally, I’m very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all the easy athletes who will seek to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my Captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was not bad.
I just paid attention to the fact that we were very lucky to take home the World Championship.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from fans and take advantage of what we’re going to be on the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go out on his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be wonderful.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t go to a public position if you’re not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what the critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from his internal policy to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not touch the mouth of his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “It is possible to take away freedom of speech, and we, the dirty and the foolish, will lead as a sheep to the battle.”
Now I’m going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The Hogan subjects blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Freedoms brought him to court.
Governor's subordinates called this claim unnecessary, and the comment on the internet was written in the spirit of "no and what".
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But that is also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic by advantage state.
He is on the second place in the approval ranking among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a reactant.
He demonstrated a firm hand in the administration of the state and commitment to his principles.
He also gently uses Facebook as the primary way to communicate with his voters and with jokes demonstrates on his page his slide after chemotherapy head.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and managed by the staff of the administration for the money of taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In a Washington Post interview, the press spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it’s too easy – to use the image of trolls, spammers, and hackers that malware on the internet.
"Post" talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who address their chosen leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, contentful and not gross.
The pastor cited the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer Sarah Ramana from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about the crimes on the ground of hatred.
“I wrote a gentle comment on the fact that I’m disappointed by the lack of his reaction to the crimes committed on the ground of hatred, and to other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section to the post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that it’s the so-called turning instead of acknowledging that they’re dealing with a large group of unhappy citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “active life position.”
In the era of Facebook, it is easy to subordinate your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much less dust work than before, when it was required to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical predecessors, or arrest and tighten the mouth of protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized because he does not want to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was charged with Twitter users who were blocked in his Twitter account.
One of the first, reversal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria, James K. Cacheris, the Chairman of the Observatory Board of the County of Laudon violated the First Amendment by banning the voter in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matthew Bevin was claimed by the American Civil Liberties Protection Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the era of affordable mail expenditure made about the same revolt as today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800 the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters strongly destroyed its authority.
And even then Washington had a deal with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yuricola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers that laughed on Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "George Washington's Documents", his cabinet was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Maritime.
But he did not try to force them to silence.
Freedom of speech, discretion and speech lies in the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agree with it.
RONAN RAFFERTI hopes on home comforts in the Renaissance club
Former European champion Ron Rafferty hopes for home comforts for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Latvia will host the twenty-five open Scottish golf tournament for elderly athletes.
Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood in the club "Archerfield Links", and moved in the direction of the final round last year until losing the Pole Iles, is attached to a new place and plays the role of representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance club build up and we’re watching it succeeds with this event,” Raferti said.
“The players will see this field at its best moment, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job, arranging this place.
He is a fierce fan of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman is looking forward to the opportunity to hold the championship title for the first time, despite the fact that he won both the European Tournament and the European Challenge Tour for his 32 years career.
“It’s really a special feeling,” said a player from Southport.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a very special time and we will always remember it.”
He returns to the battle on his homeland, Gary Orr, who joined the European Tournament for elderly athletes after earlier this year he was 50.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a bit more important,” said the resident of Helsinki Orr.
“You want to be good, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was very pleased to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I’m happy how everything is done for now.”
On the field to this trio will join the former winner of the Masters tournament Ian Wusnem and the champions of the midjours for elderly athletes Paul Broadherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalti.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McCallister, Bill Longmuyer and Ross Drammond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 per hour if one person in the car, and £10 if one person two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Its own tunnels over highways capable of absorbing car emitted carbon dioxide are already being tested on UK roads.
The transport agency of the country, according to the Autocar newspaper, positive results of the tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
A 6 metres high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that are able to absorb the harmful substances contained in the car outlets.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric tracks and modernize the park of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution occurs in transportation, and unfavourable air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgord has changed the punishment of the disabled Mamayev to a penalty
The court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years of colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev's disease "prevented him from being in prison."
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with punishment in the colony of the general regime for the robbery, the victim of which was the former fighter of the special forces.
On July 19th, the court at the exit session in the SIZO released the man from prison.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Preparing lunch, Bardaine DeGee does not use the plate.
She even uses it very rarely.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the county of Panai in the revolting Indonesian province of Papua, the hostess usually simply puts a sweet potato, which here is called the “note”, right in the foundation.
After half an hour, the hurted cabbage comes and is eaten with intolerant, unwashed hands.
Degey sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and here she does her work at home, such as washing clothes with dirty water from a nearby bowl.
The cleaning system serves a wire in a room without a roof.
She is the younger of the four wives of her husband, and therefore she was not commissioned to work in the field.
Diversity is spread here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk around the village after 5 pm,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to see the everyday life in the high mountain of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined Indonesia in 1969 after a doubtful referendum, when only 1026 elderly were forced to vote, raising hands to the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, whichins strict control over the region, unable foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as distant as abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jaapura, the administrative center of the province, to Nabira, and then a five-hour flight on a rental car.
There is no public transportation here.
The town with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo roofs; the roofs of grown steel are painted with rubber in a variety of red shades.
A few of the Indonesians arrived here, not to mention the journalists, and almost no one of the foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the papuasses of the Maye Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this clothes,” Degei tells, showing on his bright, stunned hand turban, a dark jacket and a bright shirt.
“We had only leaves on our body.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28% of its population lives beyond the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy levels are among the worst in Asia.
It is the Indonesian gold land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, belonging to the Freeport McMoran company located in Phoenix, is just six hundred miles from Panai, a mountainous province of approximately the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
Only in 2015, Freeport acquired gold and copper for approximately $3.1 billion.
Papua add-on may be proud of forest reserves, the value of which is estimated at $78 billion.
These wealths, however, trace one misfortune for the papua, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia retain their devastating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The demands of greater autonomy by the papuass threaten the existence of this golden housing and are irresistibly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969, more than 500,000 papuaes have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass murders in the populated indigenous populations of the Papua Highlands in the 1970s can be considered a genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 civilian protesters in the region.
“We’ll lose everything,” the report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese, contains evidence of crimes committed in the previous year, such as punishment without trial, torture – especially frequent as stated in another report, rape and defeat by electric current – and the brutal oppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because the accidents take place every week,” says Andreas Karson, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The Gaiques were delayed as Papua's resources attracted the flow of immigrants from other regions of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5 million population is 83% of Christians, but the demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Yavan shops, the “warunges”, sell the fried chicken and a mixture of “gado-gado” vegetables, served with arachis sauce.
Local citizens are trying to resist competition.
“Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous in Papua,” explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old pannyai who moved to Jaapuru, the province’s administrative center, because of work.
“As a result, the indigenous inhabitants of Papua – the mother-mother of Papua – have lost their sales market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Djokovic, has sworn to deal with inequality and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former murderer served the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But in Papua almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel dedicated.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovic, expecting that he will meet our hopes for the restoration of justice,” Yu says.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Djokovic Panay survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas hymns near the coaster in Enorotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
The frightened children told them that they should turn the lamps on.
As the local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their tone and a while later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were pursuing the children and piling them with screws.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, the sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was so strongly hit that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later someone burned the nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with themselves the ritual hunting leaves and performed the wita, the dance of the papua tribe of the mee pago: they ran around and painted the bird singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones to the police department and the military base.
When the situation collapsed, the soldiers in the internal radio was given an order: "If the crowd is resisting more than three times, shoot them," - so it sounded, as stated in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the Time magazine, but which was not published in the local media.
The fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kajame, the head of the Keto district in Enorotali, felt the approaching of danger and called for peace, addressing the crowd with a request to go out of the house.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned, I suddenly got a bullet in my left back,” he told Time, standing on the wing of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kaiyame still doesn’t know who shot, but he says the bullet has arrived from the sherengs of the gathered soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there was a lot of shootings,” he added.
The local resident of Alphus Yov has been hit three times, as his two-year-old brother, who has witnessed the shooting, tells.
"I fled to him and checked his body to make sure that he was," Johanes told Time, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw him dead, I kissed him.”
General Yodge Mende, the senior police inspector of Papua, told reporters that his officers were just “protecting” their base because it was attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sullistijo said in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The news of the murder arrived to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovic spoke in Jaapura with his condolences to the families of the victims and swore to deal with the question of historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never repeat again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the security minister Viranto said he would set up a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But responses came almost immediately.
“Most of the violations have occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineteenth or the beginning of zero.
The fact is that we, of course, want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to go through,” he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking to the magazine "TIME" on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to establish an organization for complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided by court.”
Viranto, whom the United Nations accused of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody voting for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been recorded, including the incident in Paniah.
The families of the victims from Paniah met such statements with dark confidence.
“In the last three years I’ve been questioned four times, but there’s been no change at all,” says Johannes.
“I’m tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacob also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniah are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was killed by the military after he helped burial four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came for me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shoot on rural residents in the neighboring district of Panyai, Deya.
During the collision between rural residents and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital, one man died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the twenty-four-year-old Ravianos Dove, who drowned while hunting fish in a river nearby, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry inhabitants of the village protested in front of the office of the construction site belonging to the company.
According to the police, the inhabitants of the village swallowed stones to officers, who in response made warning shots.
But local residents claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesia Special Forces) began shooting the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of revenge,” the twenty-nine-year-old Domingo Badiya, who lives near the hospital and has seen how quickly the wounded were delivered, told Time.
“I was hiding in my house for two days.”
The Parliament demanded the officers involved in the incident to be called for response and the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the region.
Pania has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes the dissatisfaction of the tribes of the Maye, Muni, Danni and Damal, dispersed throughout the green-covered territory of the central mountainous areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for the Free Papua (OPM), a rebellion army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by organizing sporadic attacks and attacks with kidnapping people on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Cogoy.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and unfoundly detained by the military under the pretext of “defense of national independence.”
Some have never returned.
Among the populations of Papua Panaya is considered a “tragic, forgotten place.”
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of rice sold in Enorotali is too expensive for local residents.
The bread is not available in the same degree.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly notes, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, each of whom can take care of four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten club notes are worth just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has increased between indigenous papuasses and new migrants who arrived in large amounts after the introduction of new flights to the airport of Nabira.
Few existing jobs usually reach more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papouas rarely have enough money or the skills needed to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there’s no work or money here,” says John Gobaï, chairman of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Additionally, the restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua because of "unsufficient coherence with the relevant organizations" despite they were granted rare permits to take video.
According to Phelim China, the Vice-Director for Asia of Human Rights Watch, the promises given during Djokovic’s pre-election campaign to abolish restrictions on the work of the media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Today, foreign journalists trying to keep reports from the revolting eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, are facing new dangers: visa refusal and blacklist,” he said in a statement.
A lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mainly limited by the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – appealed to the UN Human Rights Council with a request to investigate “many and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Panama.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramana Nassir rejected the group's statement, telling journalists in Jakarta that "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free press, so hiding evidence of episodes of human rights violations would be difficult."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch human rights ambassador Keys Van Baar, visited Jaapuru on May 4, the locals broke the silence, asking “We want freedom,” as a source said, who was also present at the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, a new presidential election will be held in 2019, but papua says it is unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
“Jokov is a man with good intentions, but he’s surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Panay,” says Gobaï, the chairman of the tribe.
He wants Djokovic to know that the inhabitants of Panai, in addition to the fact that they live in the shadow of the threats by the hungry army, are wiped in poverty, and their education and health care are in bad condition.
Gobi says that the inhabitants of Panai, like other papua, consider their voice given to Djokovic, a debt that he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the victims of the Panai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims in the area of the ground directly in front of the police and military area.
Knowing that justice is likely to never get tired, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says without lifting his head.
“What else we had to do?”
The fire for the second time covers Dubai’s Falel sky.
The fire covered one of the world’s highest residential clouds in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to urgently leave the seventy-nine-storey building at 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that has passed through the high building – which is coincidentally called “Fakel” – in two years.
Evacuation was carried out in the building, human casualties were not, and there was no emergency news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people’s screams.
We fled down on the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to go down from the fifth floor,” a resident of the sky, named George, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Administration, firefighters stumbled the fire around 4 p.m. local time (00 p.m. Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing asylum to the victims.
The incident could bring back on the agenda the safety issues of the materials used in the outskirts of high buildings around the world.
In the course of an investigation by the "Fakela" administration after the fire there in 2015, it was revealed that the most affected plaque – the external panels used for layout and isolation.
In the UK, the police said they believe that the isolation system and the plaque panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the June fire there, resulting in the deaths of about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flows in Ida-Viruma in June was minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee at the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists took advantage of the services of the North-Eastern hotel enterprises, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period of the year before.
The number of local tourists has decreased and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
So, the foreign tour flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12 944 to 12 525 people.
The most notably increased number of Russian tourists in the region - 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida-Viruma hotels.
Andrei Malakhov told fans who was guilty of his care.
Andrei Malakhov indicated his fans on Instagram who are guilty of his leaving the "First" channel.
So far he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for 1 August.
The photo was signed by Malakhov with the tag "boss milk sauce".
Article on how to prevent the "burn" of the worker and pay attention to his state.
If you remember the numerous reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, which took to reformat "Let's talk," it becomes clear what he so transparently suggested, writes "KP".
According to the report, TV chief Andrei Malakhov is currently on vacation and has not signed an application for dismissal from First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers killed in a car explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in the explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmand, according to RIA Novosti.
According to the police, a mined car exploded next to the blockpost of the military in the Ghirishk district last night.
It is known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new CP occurred in Hiroshima.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver scored a video capturing his camera by a sharp.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured a video of a sharp that stumbled his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Maritime Fishing Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 near the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeastern U.S., the Necn portal said.
During the submarine swimming, the man tried to take the sharp on the camera, which he kept on a special palk.
Having found a man, the animal of a length of more than three meters went to him.
The bull began to bite the camera, but did not try to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the hostage did the same way to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the sharp could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal was a novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass struggle in the Ural military center
A group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where a mass struggle occurred, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this battle have already been known.
According to the Mash publication, which appeared on the "VKontakte" page, contractors of the Ural Military Division number 31612 brutally stumbled because of the unreported bed.
It all began with the fact that the ordinary named Sayan demonstrately ignored the officer's order to send the torching plot.
At the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth group.
Saina supported the first mouth.
In a half hour, 140 young boys broke down the beds and roofs in the cabin, throwing the glass.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass struggle.
The CIA has denied the information about the pony.
The study found that at least one-fifth of U.S. passengers carried forbidden items into the aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers consciously or accidentally carried in their luggage on board the U.S. Traffic Safety Administration’s inspection points prohibited items, including at least 6 percent sat in the plane, by lack of inspection carrying prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Nearly 1 percent said they later discovered that they accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covered more than 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they consciously tried to fly with something that was prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of X-Generation members.
Consciously, the staff of the ATB most often carries food and water.
More than 3 percent acknowledged that they had specially passed through the examination of acute objects, and 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men acknowledged that they consciously passed forbidden drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it has studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally carried out the trafficking through airports inspections and how many of them did it consciously.
It is highly anticipated that most of the time – consciously or unconsciously – the trafficking is pushed through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often don’t know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what quantity.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what the ATB takes is prohibited fluids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt refuses to postpone Obama’s emission reduction rules
The next day, after a petition of 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama rules aimed at reducing the emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision with the fact that now his agency is more than in the previous administrations, listening to the needs of environmental regulators in individual states.
He did not mention the appeal against his previous position submitted to the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute arose around the deadline of October 1, to which the states must ensure compliance with the 2015 ozon standards on the ground level.
In June, Prüitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "disconformities with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Priyett, who before he was appointed by President Trump to his current office, was the general prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent to the strengthened environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms that were opposed to the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change in the course on Wednesday is a further legal defeat taken by Python to return to the previous norms.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his powers in an attempt to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested to consider that by drasticly changing the course towards ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the obligation of the EPA to cooperate with the states in a complex process of timely implementation of new standards.
“In previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to settle within the scheduled deadlines, after which he waited for claims from groups of activists and other persons and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who submitted more dozen claims against the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation through judicial proceedings and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our constitution seriously and the power it gives us."
Nevertheless, the EPA statement said that Prüitt could at some point again use its “release powers and other data of law powers” to make sure that the rules “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information”.
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader review of the ozon rules.
The draft law, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York’s Prosecutor General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of the states that appealed against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The EPA change after our demands is an important victory in the struggle for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that covers their cities,” Schneiderman said.
New York has joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil and chemical plants and other sources come into the atmosphere in response to the sunlight.
This can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health defenders and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the Prüitt course.
“It’s cruel to think about how much pressure it needed to get this perfectly logical step from a person who is committed to protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Anne Bird from the Center for Biodiversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and to defend those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF to extend the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted for the extension of the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (VFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Recovery Council, which released a report on Monday in which it recommended to leave the removal in force.
For the extension of the removal voted 166 people, against - 21, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report stated that the IAAF has made significant progress in achieving the conditions established by the IAAF Council for the Restoration of Membership, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championship in London, Russian athletes were forced to stand under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people enrolled in the IAAF Championship.
VFLA was subjected to unlimited disqualification by the IAAF in 2015.
The report was published by the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound, which spoke of numerous violations of the WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF council, read in the "Ъ" material "IAAF has extended sanctions against VFLA".
Dangerous defeat
In the framework of the 3th round of the Fombet-first of Russia among the teams of the PFL, the new Moscow "Chemic" held an exit match against the FC "Kaluga".
More than 10 days ago, the competitors played each other in the Cup of Russia, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" did not undermine the opponent in anything, but secondary relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the calughs with the score of 0:3 many predicted the easy victory of the masters in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the new Moskovs forced themselves to count and act from defense, but from a position of force.
In the 1st quarter, the squaders made more and had the advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very quality match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous strikes and his actions gave the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemic" was missing efforts and effort to put the defense "Kaluga" in the fool and hit the first goal at the departure.
After the break the game began to run on meeting courses.
The newly-Moscowers were more active in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team were defensive errors, which allowed the calughs to create a number of sharp moments.
In 10 minutes before the end of the meeting, "Chemic" took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kalugan played its role - they held the finish more skillfully and cold-bloodly, waiting for their moment to take the door.
After a dangerous attack, the "Chemic" transferred the ball to the corner, the submission of which the field owners were without resistance transferred to the gate.
The goal was written by Yuri Dubrovnik.
In the reporting meeting "Chemic" demonstrated a bad game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
In front of our team awaits another departure - August 11 at 19 p.m. in Moscow at the "Torpedo" stadium named Eduard Streltsov the new-Moscow will confront with the favourite group "Center" FC "Ararat", in the composition of which are Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Aleksei Rebko.
Come to support “Chemist!”
The place and time of the meeting of the new Moskovs - 18 h. 30 min. near the store "Magnolia" (Eastern, d.2, corp.
The composition of "Chemistry": Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Homutov, Goji (Oreskin), Dudaiti, Rizov, Svatov, Belyanin (Adoevcev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to the published decryptions of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about paying the wall at the border.
The Washington Post newspaper published decrypts of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nietoy, Trump insisted that he would stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. President complained him that he was publicly speaking against the wall, and, according to the news, he told him, “You can’t say this to the press.”
Trump began his pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the U.S. southern border and swore that it will force Mexico to pay for the project.
In the published decryption of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also found a hot scratch.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees to travel to Australia is “smiling”, “dirty” and “stupid,” and insisted that due to the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like a fool as he intended to stop the immigration of refugees to the U.S.
Trump concluded the conversation, saying to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia tourists sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", on the board of which are the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia Russians, departed at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg.
At the end point of the tracking board will meet the staff of the ritual agency, as well as the representatives of the city's mayor, told reporters Deputy Minister for Resort and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba.
Earlier, the representatives of the Republic’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia were taken by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the victims a compensation of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazia leadership expressed its willingness to pay to the relatives of the victims of the explosions tourists flight and residence in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only confidence on the right to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsk Gudautsky district on the warehouse of the missile-artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which large-caliber missiles and other ammunition that were stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which caused uncontrolled explosions of missiles of different modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens were killed - Elena Polyakova of 1970 and Elena Timofeeva of 1962, who were on a vacation near a hydrocarbon source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of different gravity were delivered to medical facilities of the Republic.
There are currently seven people in the hospital, the rest are removed.
The investigation of the Russian influence on the U.S. elections will be carried out by a large jury.
Russian Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called a major jury in Washington to investigate Russia’s influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters reports.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under a swear.
The collected materials will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to file the charges.
The call of a major jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the investigations of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of the then presidential candidate Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016, Müller himself has previously promised.
They are investigated by the FBI.
In late July it was that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the state of his lawyers.
Trump's younger previously told that he was waiting for a compromise to the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton from the meeting with Veselnitskaya, but no revealing documents were presented, and the discussion was eventually about adoption.
In early August in a number of media appeared information that the Trump-young statement about the meeting with Veselnicka was literally dictated by the Trump-young.
The White House stated that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority as any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Pence Arrested at Workplace
Deputy head of the administration of Pence, Irina Shirshina, has been arrested for 48 hours on the order of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement bodies on this matter have not yet arrived, but the press service of the SU SC has assured that they will follow soon.
The mayor of Pence has not commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five Deputy Head of the Administration of Pence.
She has curated urban issues and land relations, taking this position since April 2015.
Before that, she worked for a long time as the head of the Administration of the State Inspection of the Penzen Region.
Irina Shirshina raises three minors, noting that once again she became a mother a year ago, she gave up decree leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no cosmodrome or missile carriers in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a gift of respect to the first man to visit the space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are carried in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "go on the planet."
In 2012, the monument was established in Houston, near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was established in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a Gagarina monument in Germany in the city of Erfurt, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) was avoided in 1992 thanks to public protests and was transferred from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga appeared the monument of Yurius Gagarin.
This is how the name and surname of the first astronaut sounds in Latin, and he looks like he was 70 years old.
Murder at Mors Ford: Activists lose Lynch's trials on stage to call for justice
“Ford Mercury” in 1948 passed through the spectators in the village of Monroe in Georgia, and with a reveal shut down to the small Moss Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver arrived at the bridge, a group of white men with weapons blocked her road.
The main - a middle-year-old man dressed in a thin strip - stretched himself with a cigarette and looked through the wind glass.
Those sitting inside were scattered by fear.
“We need this Nigger, Roger!” the man screamed.
“Take it out of the car!”
The vibrant waves broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just an inscenation.
But when the Rodger's neck was wrapped, almost all the viewers and really hid the breath.
Since 2005, the activists are returning to the Moss Ford Bridge to lose again that night, when in 1946, the dolls linked two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the show.
“This is a spot in our history and it is a stone on our souls.”
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia, who fights for human rights all his life.
For him, the show is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the residents of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigation, we want conclusion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to justice,” he said.
“We can’t go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The corner covers the simple body of one of the victims of the lining at Mors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to data from the FBI received by En-By News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of taking part in the linen.
No one has ever been charged.
Though suspects have been released for decades, human rights defenders say that in the city they have always well known two linked motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court's ruling first allowed black citizens to vote for the premiere, which had to be held that summer.
Approximately during the same elections, according to the FBI reports, the black user Roger Malcolm hit in the struggle with a knife of Barnet Hester, the white land owner - apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors in the city, Hester slept with his wife, Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she had to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Louis Harrison, a big white land owner, paid a $600 deposit to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and entered the Mors Ford Bridge, a crowd of lineners surrounded the car.
“It is clear that Harrison organized and commandered the murders,” this conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the law enforcement authorities of the state and the city, which not only took part in the murders but also destroyed the evidence and hidden the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attempt on electoral rights,” he says.
“They’ve all been killed to send a black signal to the city: if you register and vote, you’ll be the same.”
For ten years, Cassandra Green has been directing an annual show that reproduces the lining at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, it captures the audience and tells us about the deep racism that, as many would like to think, is no longer in America.
It’s hard to see and even harder to turn back, but Green thinks that’s the most important thing.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch’s trials because they show us our own madness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or hear that I’ve experienced.”
This year’s performance began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors – the jungle of the white, the rest of the black – gathered in the room and listened to the year-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He has played the role of the chief member of the clan for several years, but he says that the role has never become easier.
“I think I’ve got off because it’s not the person I’m,” says Marbo.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to come back at that time.”
In the room, the actors Darrius Bradshow and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hester, repeat their roles.
The show begins with the fact that Malcolm, angry by the fact that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screams and throws him.
“I said, ‘Nigga, leave my house!’
He screams in response.
The blow is spread.
And at the same time, all (at least all the black actors) are expressed with a hobby.
Green laughs more loud.
“What’s that?” asks Ascone.
He is worried and disturbed.
I play over?
“No,” Green says through laughter.
“I just don’t think white people were saying ‘nigga’.”
“Yes,” laughs one of the black performers.
“You have to raise the hard ‘r’.”
And the energy in the room also changes: discomfort is changed by a sense of friendship.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the scene, but also for the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rush says the word to the letter "n", it becomes clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends brutally and quickly.
Crying, shooting, and then silence.
A woman in sad black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
In a hundred yards, half a hundred spectators throw tears and sweat out of their eyes.
Among the viewers almost the same number of black and white.
One couple came from Itak, New York to see the show; many live quite close.
They all suffered the heavy spirit of Georgia for eight hours, while Brooks led them to a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Before that, the murders remained only a history, but now, when they stand in the same place where people were linked, it seems that their ghosts fly right in the air.
When the last note of the song is silent, Green invites people to get closer and look at the body.
Children tend to their heads, touch the color that depicts blood, and the stable bodies, and scream something to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy tightened, as if he had to remind himself of it.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the audience, and suddenly everything ended.
The actors remove the chains from their neck and throw the tears.
Bradshow embraces Marbo, a man in a costume who played the main popcorn.
Nick Riscona embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their embraces: the emotional burden of the show eventually collapsed on him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women shouted.
“We know that your heart is good.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the viewers are sitting to dinner with the actors.
Behind one table, a white couple from Atlanta discusses a spectacle with a black couple they just met.
Dennis Daplinsky is hard to find words to describe what she feels after the show.
“It’s sad to hear these terrible, dirty words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think the lynching is still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called the police shooting.”
In the other corner of the room, the general attention was attracted by Tyron Brooks, who after the meal remembers his work as a human rights activist.
He says he has already started planning for the next year.
“The situation inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we’ve experienced, but it also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t get out of this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their history, are condemned to repeat it.”
The court sentenced Navalny for violations on the "agitation Saturday"
The Simonov court of Moscow sentenced Alexei Navalny to a fine of 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of organizing the demonstration.
The opponent was convicted of committing an administrative offence, provided for in section 8 of article 20.2 of the COP of the Russian Federation "Recurrent violation of the order of organizing the meeting".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hyzir Mussakayev, ended up examining the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the headquarters of the opposition Alexei Navalny, who attracted himself to responsibility according to the same article as Navalny.
Wolf was convicted and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakayev assessed the spread of the brochures on the “agitation Saturday”, which the supporters of Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9th.
Having seen the agitmateriaals that followed the participants of the Saturday, the police found that the organizers of the event deliberately hidden its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to request permission from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev requested the termination of the administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of the composition of the offence and indicated that the police accepted certain failures in the preparation of the protocol.
At the very “agitation Saturday” Volkov was not delayed, but he received a schedule obliging him to appear to the police department to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same orders were received by Navalny himself and another opposition fellow, Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia arrested the shooter of the bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was by the Republican Investigative Committee.

The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, gas turbines, oil and oil mining facilities, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with the Minergo and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The government's draft resolution is ready and presented to public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unfaithful partners and hackers.

Pearson will cut more than 3,000 jobs and reduce dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British Pearson educational group announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent in connection with the launch of a new restructuring program aimed at dealing with the challenges facing their.
These job cuts, which, according to CEO John Fellon, will mainly occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to 4,000 jobs reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pearson has announced that it plans to cut expenditure by another £300 million ($394 million) in May during the third expenditure reduction program to try to return to life the business that hit the rapid transition to digital learning methods.

Attack on a cabin in Kabul: NATO soldier killed as a result of a deadly explosion
According to official sources, the dead terrorist attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were injured, NATO reports.
According to unverified data from local sources, as a result of the incident in the city district of Karabakh also killed three civilians.
This explosion is the last of the bloodshed that hit Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday as a result of the explosion in a mosque in Gerat.
On Monday, a terrorist killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of "human-transported self-made explosive device".
According to the report, all the injured are in stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Reporters report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilian deaths occurred in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, a terrorist-death explosion on a car caused the deaths of at least 30 people in the Shia district in Kabul.
The Taliban said the attack was carried out.
More than 150 people were killed as a result of a powerful bombing in the center of the city on May 31, which is the most serious terrorist attack in the country since the 2001 United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power.
Violence emphasizes the uncertainty situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is evaluating whether it is necessary to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul that have occurred over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public trust in the government, its line of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the decision to postpone the air pollution law
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has repealed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama era law that states must limit air polluting emissions, a day after 15 states have appealed to the agency for the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements - 2015", stressing that this step shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsibility towards them,” said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to postpone the ozon measurements in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced so that it meets the stricter air purity standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit claiming that the intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental provisions introduced by former President Barack Obama, within the framework of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, on brilliant economic growth.
But the actions in this direction caused resistance from the Democrats and environmental organizations, concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says that the use of ozon-containing air to breathe “can deteriorate the lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
European Business Association opens new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association expressed its disagreement with U.S. economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to the AEB, such measures may lead to a serious decrease in production and employment.
The statement says that business is one of the important bonds between countries and people, so it is not possible to limit the principles of free trade.
The European business combines more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the leaders of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of behavior that would allow business to be separated from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and consensus.
Deputies ask the police to restrict traffic on the coastline in Pskov
The Pskov People's Electors sent a call to the head of the UMVD by the city Sergey Surin on the problem of movement over the coastal river the Great.
Parliamentarians Constantine Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that automobilists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
They believe that control of drivers will help make this area more peaceful and secure.
The problem is that the breachers ignore the signs of the pedestrian road and freely ride on the coastline.
It turns out that capital repairs and repairs have been done badly.
Sports and children's places because of cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov news agency, on the evening the central coast is patrolled by employees of the PPS Motor Patrol and friends.
This makes the number of passing cars less, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin calls on investigative authorities not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to ban the investigation bodies not to remove servers and hard drives from operating computers in enterprises.
This was stated by the head of state at the meeting on the investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the application in the interests of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers."
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, "it is enough to remove copies, verify them and use them during the investigation."
He added that it is not possible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the activity of the enterprise until it is impossible to pay taxes."

British actor Robert Hardy has died.
The British actor Robert Hardy, who played the magical minister Cornelius Faj in the screenplay of a series of Harry Potter novels, died at the 92nd year of his life.
This was by the Independent newspaper on Thursday.
The actor's death was told by his relatives.
According to them, he lived "a huge life, achieving success in cinema, theatre and television for 70 years of career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltnam.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played together with Lawrence Olivier in the "Tragedy of the Corylane".
Hardy also remembered the repeated performance of the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenshots of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.

Robert Hardy was also repeatedly forced to play the role of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Something disappeared in the Danish state: Prince Henry, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count of Labard, refused to be buried with his Venice wife, Queen Margaret.
This year, the chat has a "gold" wedding, but in the agenda of the couple - not preparations for celebrations, but a murderous dispute.
His highness rejected the title of Prince-Consort, while he came to the address of the queen that he had never been so happy with the title of King-Consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains the official wife of the queen.
Russian Foreign Ministry calls on Washington to stop sheltering Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The corresponding statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spread some time ago.
In his comment, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly actively using the Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the U.S. authorities to stop sheltering the Russian Federation.
The US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mother Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talk about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who, according to all, are constantly moving towards the most exciting boxing match weighing up to £147 in the near future, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN channels in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, passed the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization champion of the second half lightweight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories, Erian Bronero on Saturday on the showtime channel, both boxers are among the five best boxers regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “What do you do, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in the match with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven a.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would be the first time.
“I’ve been in a half-light weight before,” Garcia recalled.
“I’ve risen to the category for Brenner [up to £140], but I’m not so big.
I am a little for 140.
I want to go down to half light.
And he must rise to a half-light [up to £135], and then we will set a battle.
This is what fans want.
Let us arrange it to them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Box needs this battle.”
Climas asked if the battle should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he is pursuing that Lomachenko will carry out his debut battle in the weight of 135 later this year to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nocautes), who is also interested in fighting with the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their battle for the title of lightweight world champion on the forum arena on September 23.
“The battle may be on the PPV because all fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing later the willingness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said that he believes Lomachenko is a "striking boxer" and will visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko didn’t immediately sweep Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks “very slow, forgive, Mikey... you were sweeping on the nocaut.”
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the blow, and then the box.
They both said they feel the tension rises before their own match.
“This battle must take place.
No other struggle causes so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on him,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here is he, Mikey.
It will be a great battle.”

Putin ordered the Prosecutor General to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation to check the territory of Baikal on the subject of the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Prosecutor’s Office to check the Bykal territory on the subject of the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities,” Vladimir Putin said at a meeting dedicated to the issues of environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader has asked to take action if the facts of the violations are revealed.
New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to the new medical age assessment method, show that more than 80 percent of protesters were assessed as persons over the age of 18, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of the age in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for failing to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed they were minors.
At the moment, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the agency of judicial medicine has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between the middle of March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the tested were assessed as people aged 18 or older, and in another 25 cases the agency of judicial medicine estimated that the tested "probably a person aged 18 or older."
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that a person “probably less than 18.”
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Geranson from the agency of judicial medicine, the results match the results for the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference with the statistics for the past months, the numbers are quite corresponding,” he told The Local.
The high percentage of cases in which people were considered to have reached the age of 18, does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and that in 442 cases, “the most likely age of the tested is 18 years or more.”
However, reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases a person openly stated that 18 were performed this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting of making a röntgen of the teeth of wisdom and a tomography of the knee joints and giving them to the analysis to dentists and X-ray scientists, also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to evaluate the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have passed through sexual maturity earlier or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the methods of measurement that are being used now.
The biological age is determined in this way very incorrectly.
If we can’t determine it with confidence, we shouldn’t do the way we can,” he told Metro.
However, Goransen from the agency of judicial medicine stated in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In the general case, it can be said that the risk is wrong to take a child for an adult child.
The biggest risk we face is when a person will soon be 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I want to vote for the presidency.
During his work trip to Buryatya, Vladimir Putin swallowed that he was ready to think about whether he will be voting for the post of President of Russia in the 2018 election, reports Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushki Buryatskaya region.
During the video conference dedicated to the eradication of the fire in the Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the spokesman addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a prayer to you: when the next presidential election will be, we will all ask you to vote again for this post."
“Good, I’m going to think, thank you,” the president said in response.
On July 28, the press spokesman of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that Vladimir Putin's presidential headquarters will be headed by the head of the administration of the Russian President Anton Weino.
Peskov called these assumptions “nothing unfounded, hypothetical considerations.”
"As long as there are no stages, to the establishment of the stages is far, to the election campaign is far," Peskov said.
“Then this is on the agenda,” said Peskov.
Governor of West Virginia says he is moving to another party
Governor of West Virginia, representative of the Democratic Party Jim Jastis announced on Thursday during a meeting with President Trump that he was moving to another party.
“You like it or not, but the Democrats have gone away from me,” Governor Jastis said.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts...Today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you, remaining a governor-democrat.”
The demonstration exploded with apologies.
“So tomorrow I am changing my registration to a Republican,” Jastis added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play differently.”
Previously, Trump promised that an important statement will be made at a demonstration in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a overweight of 42 percent, and Justin did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states as he inherited the coal business from his father.
Its assets are estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party on Thursday evening issued a statement that “the transition of Governor Jastis to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is rather hinder than works to make our country again great.”
“Given only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislative bodies in history, the statement of Governor Jastis is just another rejection from a party that has no leaders from above down and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” CBS News said in a statement by the National Committee Representative of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel.
Cat-weight by click Mr. Beautiful found the house thanks to the social networks
The pet of Pittsburgh (North Carolina, U.S.) made a cat named Mr. Krasavchik weighing more than 14 pounds after he became famous for the internet.
This is by Mashable.
At the end of June, the pet's account on Facebook was posted a photo of a cat asking to find his owner because "it's obviously someone has eaten him before."
In the comments users noted that the expression of the animal's mord can become a new mem.
The publication received more than 3,2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to welcome Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was given to the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take over his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American woman told her that she had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with the photo of the animal collected more than 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could quite make a career in the model business.
Koe praised "only" excuses of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International athletic specialist Sebastian Koou on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but repeated that this is the unsuitable time to again allow the country to participate in sports competitions.
Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics Dmitry Schlachtin said at the congress of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, which took place in the eve of the World Championship in Light Athletics, that removing his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologizes "all athletes who have been stolen gold and silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations voted for the preservation of the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on found evidence of state-funded doping use.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report were very honest,” the president of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations Kou told reporters.
“All the council and all the congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation itself acknowledges that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything to take care of the reconstruction of the federation.”
Koe said he also "loved" that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission, according to which it is now not time to restore Russia in rights,” Kou said.
“In the next few months we have to do everything we can to fix this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the blocked system,” he added.
Nine Russian athletes, which meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Light Athletics Championship, which will start on Friday in London.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements are still to be fulfilled for the restoration of Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the Council of the International Association of Athletic Federations, the drug testing is not yet carried out in sufficient amounts, and the removed coaches are still quietly performing their work.
The court has arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of nationalism
Arrested by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravsky has been sent to prison for two months.
The employee of the internet edition "Journal Zhytomir" is suspected of state deceit by placing his publications on the Russian sites and in violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The patrull ship "Commandante Borsini" entered Libya's territorial waters to then, together with the Navy of the country, stop the flow of illegal migrants.
The decision on the start of the operation was adopted by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country’s territory.
The Libyan parliament, which is opposed to the Cabinet, accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
And commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar gave his subordinate orders to counter Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they do not believe in these threats and intend to send another military vessel to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the EU-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went to the establishment of a maritime mission to fight illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal people arriving in the country from Libya in July were published: 95 thousand people since the beginning of the year.
The government said the resources for the reception of migrants were exhausted.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian team for light athletics removed from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlik and Olesya Povch, who specialize in running on short distances, are excluded from the composition of the Ukrainian team for the World Cup 2017 in London.
This is on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the organization in connection with the initiation of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against athletes.
From the composition of the Ukrainian delegation, the coach of the Landak Sergey Basenko was also excluded.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects an athlete in doping.
Poph - the bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, the champion of Europe-2010 in the 4 to 100 meters, Earth - the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the 4 to 400 meters.
The World Athletics Championship will be held in London from 4 to 13 August.
How Football's Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending from European football clubs do not prevent the world recording Neymar’s transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.
Any consequences can come further on the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by the UEFA, the management body that controls European football, in whose authority to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the Financial Fair Play introduced by the UEFA in 2011, it follows that the PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a complaint that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
The PSG can be luxurious to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars if it takes into account the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them on account of legal sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he was elected president of the UEFA in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that fall into huge debts in their pursuit of success, in essence, were crushing and risking a breakthrough if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on club debts and instead switched to track their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then seriously spend to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year estimation period of 2018 the clubs may suffer 30 million euros of losses.
And, despite Platini's shameful withdrawal from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Cheferin is still determined to withdraw the excessive spending.
“Naturally, the FFP is alive, and we, moving forward, will strengthen the rules,” said Andrea Traverso, the FFP controller at the UEFA Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG and will pay Neymar's contract withdrawal at the same time, he can distribute this amount for reporting throughout the entire period of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer cost can be shown in the annual report as costs of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 to the PSG, as well as to the belonging to Abu Dhabi Manchester City, heavy sanctions were applied.
The PSG was sentenced to a fine of 60 million euros (by that course it was $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was prescribed to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
The UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to interfere with its financial inspections by dividing their revenue on account of companies associated with the club owners.
Although the Qatar company could promote the PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market prices, the UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
That’s what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the amount of the financing of the “PSG” by the Qatar Tourism Administration was dropped.
It was that part of Neymar’s earnings in the PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But the PSG and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will become the world championship ambassador, and such a maneuver could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more carefully monitoring any attempts to overcome the rules.
As persons familiar with the situation said Thursday, the UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with the PSG on Neymar's transfer.
They talked with the Associated Press agency on terms of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the PSG received more than 10 million euros of profits with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, sales of attributes and shorts with the team’s logo.
The club predicts that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Uncertainly angry by the leaving of one of the best footballers, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar’s transfer, saying that the PSG would break the financial fair play.
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’ with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper, saying that the final owner of the PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the U.S. sports magnate, divides La Liga's doubts about the club's financing by the state.
“This is all the consequences of the share participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape over the past fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It will become very difficult to follow the financial fireplay because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be presented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the swear will be determined by the President.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear to the loyalty of the Russian Federation, will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the parliamentarians planned to directly determine the procedure for making the oath in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the ceremonial oath, as well as those who are unable, according to the updated text of the amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (it is at the disposal of "Izvestij"), which the committee on July 11 will consider before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of introducing a sword when entering the Russian citizenship instead of the formal signature of the documents President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Vladimir.
Deputies formed this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading to a bill that provides for the cancellation of the decision on granting citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the internet (Article 2 article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the kidnapping of a plane, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (Article 4 article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the draft law, its logic was the following: by formulating the documents for citizenship, a person signs under a promise to comply with the Russian legislation - a rule on the way of extremism, he breaks this promise.
The bill was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Justice Russia") and the spokesman of the Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The members of the Parliament accepted it in the first reading on 19 May.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the order of swearing will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Previously, the parliamentarians intended to describe the procedure directly in the law "On the citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a ceremonial setting in front of the state herb and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should be held - a list of places where the herb of the Russian Federation can be placed, regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipal institutions, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be ZAGS.
Those who wish to obtain Russian citizenship will make a solemn swear after officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be obtained by a person after he has brought a swear, according to the pre-worked text.
A week ago the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signature of the decree.
In the updated text, it is said that Russia will swear from 18 years, not from 14.
The rule is retained by which the unable or limited-capable will be exempt from the sworn, as well as those who cannot speak, read or sign the text of the sworn.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
Also, the updated bill provides a special order of reception to Russian citizens of the residents of Ukraine, who are considered to be Russian language carriers.
They will have to officially refuse the Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an appropriate declaration to the authorized body of Ukraine.
Notarily certified copy of the statement will be submitted to Russian officials.
The withdrawal of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided by an international treaty or if it is impossible “for reasons that do not depend on the person”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among which the first vice-speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farahov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, very many people are waiting for a decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text has been clarified that the restrictions on occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have writtenly refused the "other" citizenship and delivered the previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but "for non-dependent reasons" he has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Currently, foreigners are forbidden to occupy positions in the municipal service, to be accepted to work on facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with a double citizenship or a visa for residence in another country cannot become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017, at that time the necessary sub-legislative acts must be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "The Hot American Summer" and "The Detective's Warehouse"
The current iteration of history nostalgically reminds of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; the era of the grand in the 90s (e.g., when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made a comedy "State" for MTV); and about themselves - that is, about the 2001 year, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Rudd moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise it seems anachronism.
"The First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking vegetable bank, which was sounded by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-age actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; thanks to this, the impossibility to return to becomes part of a joke.
"Ten years later", where adults played already adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parodiality is more asymmetrical and includes rifes from the 90-year-old stalker films such as "Hands that climb the wing".
In one episode, the character comes with the Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller coins, and "a handful of other things from 1991".
Many stories are the same.
The Goodwill Cup (Shoulter), now a writer, has not yet achieved mutuality from Katy (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet divorced from virginity.
And there is still a crazy and foolish conspiracy that involves Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter), who is now encouraged by George Bush the Elder (the experienced parody in the performance of Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the withdrawal from it.
It’s fun to see the eternally young Rudd singing the song of Matt Dylan from “The Solitary”, whose character, the former great man Andy, now looks old.
To bring this franchise success could be the random madness in the spirit of the type of recurrent series "Seven Up", until it reaches what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "The Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film "The Hot American Summer".
“The Good Detective” on the Amazon addresses a different type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from “Americans”, “The Explosive Blonde” or even “The Lightning” with her images of the struggle of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gettwood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Rice Thomas, depicts a TV film: a Romanian police drama of the 80s about two police officers in Bucharest struggling for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenin path.
The main roles - the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Peersick Jr. and Cornelius Ulic, and their dialogues are spoken in English by Channing Tatum (he is the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
This is a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (the police spend time watching the match of chess as the Americans could watch football).
The team of famous votes for the cast – among them Jenny Slayt, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini – makes it interesting to play in “Get Your Voice”.
But "Tovarish Detective" so holds for the credibility of the uncertainty of the propaganda drama - there is even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - which often looks like her.
Six long episodes are delayed, and funny is not very often.
If it were done more submissively, the "Tovarish Detective" could better deal with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregory and Joseph come to the U.S. Embassy, two thick men sit in the vestibule, absorbing a lot of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist spectator this image tells us that Western culture is able to make a look at anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia in football between "Spartak" and "Lokomotiv" will amount to about 30 million rubles.
This was by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pratkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that the tickets for the match are almost not left.
The match "Spartak" - "Lokomotiv" will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young people cleaned the furniture for 200 thousand rubles
A 37-year-old officer, who has a furniture firm, has been sent to the police.
The man said he stole expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to his production.
The drawing of the thieves became tools of a total cost of 200 thousand rubles: two welding apparatus, a perforator, a hydraulic, a leaf.
The guards of order began searching for criminals and soon came out to the residents of the Blessed district of Bashar, friends 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic, the associates penetrated the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and brought out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first car service.
Against them, the case of theft has already been initiated, and the law enforcement authorities have managed to return to the legitimate owner only part of the stolen instruments.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words on the relations of Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Deputy Hiser Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that, by adopting new anti-Russia sanctions, the U.S. put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nawert acknowledged that the Russian-American relations are on a "low level", but noted that it is necessary to look for "spaces for interaction."
“Look at the cessation in the southwest of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month.”
“And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,” the diplomat said.
At the same time, a representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that the sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document failed and contradicts the U.S. Constitution.
Dior grows roses from amethysts and quartz
The Jewellery unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has completed the collection of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They appeared five new rings and three chokers on barhat stripes.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has released two new rings and columns of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glyptics (manual cutting on the stone) and patch and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of the Dior Joaillerie, Victor de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that was grown in his Granville room by the designer Christian Dior, and the Paris Gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catherine.
Trump finds guilty for deteriorating relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed sharp criticism to Congress members.
According to the U.S. leader, their actions led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
“You can thank the congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president wrote on Twitter.
Donald Trump signed a new law on sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
They will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later spread a statement by the president, in which he said that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable transactions and would even closer the Russian Federation, China and North Korea.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenia withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the application for the purchase of the subsidiary Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of “to focus on our other planned investments and projects we are working on.”
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main candidate for the purchase of the Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU in July rejected the application of the NorvikBank Consortium Grigory Gusellnikov and the Belarusian company Saida Guseriyev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Foreign Economic Bank - and became Sberbank.
Novak calls the cause of the black hole in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation has named the cause of the black cave in Crimea.
With explanations about the incident, the head of the department, Alexander Novak, spoke.
According to him, the peninsula remained without electricity due to a road accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck caught the electricity line, resulting in the disconnection of the Cuban and related Crimean networks.
Strikes in the electricity supply of the major cities of Crimea were recorded last week.
Specialists removed the failure within a few hours.
Initially it was that the cause of blackjack could be an abnormal heat.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have caused rumors about a possible rise.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain untouchable, and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) specialists voted with a result of 6 against 2 to maintain the rates at 0.25%, while this month a smaller number of committee members expressed their favour to increase the rates because weak economic growth weakened the support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to a rise of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family income will continue, while it is still expected that inflation in autumn will rise to approximately 3%.
However, the bank warned that the rise of rates in the next few years will be necessary to control the inflation caused by the Brexit, and said that the loans costs will likely have to rise stronger than expected on the financial markets.
The committee members also voted in favour of giving up part of the massive economic development package launched a year ago due to the Brexit.
Starting in February, the bank will close an urgent funding plan to provide banks with cheap loans, although it said it is now on to provide another £15 billion in the plan – up to £115 billion.
According to MPC’s basic forecasts, GDP growth will remain slow in the near future, while the pressure on real income of families continues to affect consumption.
On the issue of interest rates, he repeated that in order to stop inflation, it will require "a bit of financial policy aggravation" in "a bit greater" size than the markets expect.
Currently, the markets are predicting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasized that all increases will be “stageous” and “limited”.
The bank’s growth forecasts this and next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its 1.8% forecast unchanged in 2018.
After these news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent unthinking growth indicators weakened the expected increase; GDP then rose by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, according to all, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason for the pleasure of the households, which were hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before it decreases.
The bank added that the financial policy “can’t prevent” the earnings over the next few years, but expects salaries “significantly” to recover at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also bound to growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods, due to a low pound rate that compensates for a part of the reduced consumer expenditure.
The decision was taken a year after the interest rates were reduced to 0.25 percent in August after the shocking outcome of the referendum on the issue of leaving the European Union, which resulted in a drop in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully influence the prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last ratio on interest rates, the noise around the expected rise of interest rates increased, as inflation increased pressure on and so stressed households: three members of the committee specialists asked to raise interest rates to 0.5 percent in July.
In the past month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank’s report, this decline was expected and in the coming months again will be compensated.
According to the bank, a higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlayk, Chairman of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “If you take into account the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market will again become even more competitive as creditors require business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market looks favorable to those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission and with a low rate, becomes more popular than ever.”
The State Health Service will prescribe a controversial drug against HIV to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to the “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after the Battle of the High Court on the issue of financing the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a tablet taken before sex, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in people in the risk group by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal supported last year the Supreme Court ruling that the National Health Service had the possibility to pay the PREP despite her statements that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step, which was announced on Thursday, was called a “important innovation” by President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Administration (NAT) called it a “reverse moment.”
Before the full launch of the program throughout England by April 2018, the venerological dispensers in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be one of the first to register people, and even more dispensers will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is the course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people in the risk group.
When taking PREP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain medications to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients who are entitled to the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender men and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The sponsors will select the appropriate participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is deterred by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and attributed to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispenser participating in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international tender on purchases signed a drug supply agreement.
The study was built in such a way as to evaluate all the possibilities of PREP by collecting clinical data about who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and its large-scale use.
“This important innovation must complement and strengthen the wider and increasingly successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is another step in more than three decades of success in fighting one of the greatest health threats faced by mankind.
Debora Gold, chairman of the National AIDS Control Board (NAT), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if properly targeted to people in need of help and at risk, will give the opportunity to change the situation of cases with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at the risk group for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England by the National Health Service, will get access to a new opening new possibilities tool, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many or many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Today, first of all, we need to make sure that the test is rapidly spread throughout the country and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we are supplied with the experimental PREP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Shadow Minister of People’s Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We are very welcome to the start of the PREP test, it has been very late due to months of delays and the government’s threads.”
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ceasing the transmission of this rococal infection.
This test will bring us a step closer to a full understanding of the advantages of PREP.
It is now important that the test will be deployed throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people at the risk of HIV and advance us further towards the stop of the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on supporting the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The sixth congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCT) adopted a resolution, in which it noted the importance of preserving the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively proven form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the congress emphasized in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the distinction of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
He has played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.
The Treaty between Moscow and Kazakhstan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was signed for 10 years.
On July 11th, Deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan addressed the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the appointment of the position of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only, whose position is called "President".
In Russia there were difficulties in obtaining international driving rights
The GIBDD units experience a deficiency in international driving licences (MVUs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to leave for a vacation abroad with their car or take it to rent there.
The situation with international driving licenses remains contradictory.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
Requirements to international law are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in the countries that ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized and so.
However, in fact, it all depends on specific police or rental offices: some require the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and some enough national rights.
To be insured, international law drivers still get, but it is worth taking into account that in the countries that have not ratified the convention (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Now the problem with the forms is observed in almost all GIBDD units, reports "Kommersant", conducting a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow in the UGBDD units the talons are simply not issued, the forms are missing for four months.
You can register for the reception on the website of the state services, but there the line has already extended to the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "for technical reasons" without getting into the details, in the Samarian region honestly they say that there are no forms, the similar situation is drawn up in other cities.
The problem has already been faced by many Mosquitians, the social networks are increasingly appearing such messages:
Irina Burmistrova: “Imagine, why is it not possible to obtain international rights in Moscow?”
Right, because in all GIBD departments the forms have ended.
Elena Podkolzina: “A Question to Knowing People!”
International law is urgent.
In Moscow all the time is hit far forward, in the place the talons are not issued at all (the button is available, but the talon cannot be given).
The public service portal seems to show that in SPB time is free to figa.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
It works?
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving licences have changed, so the subdivision of the State Automotive Inspection is delivering new forms.
This may be associated with a deficit, however, it is unclear what changes are being discussed, it has not been earlier.
The forms are purchased by the Centre for Special Destination in the field of Traffic Safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to the GIBD division.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with AO "Goznak": in 2014-2015 years, 200 thousand forms were manufactured, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with AO "First Printing Court" for the manufacture of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply failed to hold the tender in time, which caused the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: due to the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, it is unclear to the end, so people are reinsurance, and therefore there is an agitating demand for international "cuts".
It has recently been known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by Minecraft.
The International Driving Certificate (MVU) of the new sample is in force from 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refuses to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petroenko said he does not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the portal "Observator".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bullet or a crack there because it is at risk of losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan – in the countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"It is, according to my deep belief, the prospects of this project are actually not available," Petroenko said.
He added that he believes that Russia is unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build even less-scale objects.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, the entire stadium has already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I think, the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so invisible to join this project,” the official said.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the car arc of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch Coast, a massive assembly of the road arc of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its coat will be closed at a height of 45 meters from the basis of the construction.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared for the installation of a railway arc on the farvater support," the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of the schedule.
The Crimean Bridge connects the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Region.
Spanish official dismissed who did not work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the state service) should have the head of the Spanish official, Carlos Résio?
The permanent walk extended for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Ratio was dismissed.
Not his direct boss.
What is not happening in the world of bureaucrates.
The audience seems to have long been accustomed to all the fools of “the servants of the people.”
And yet, the officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the “sensation” came from Spain.
There, the archive employee of Valencia, Carlos Résio, was able to do the job for ten years.
He regularly received a complaint.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And here the “wonderful times” of Mr. Ratio have ended.
He was dismissed by the decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation it was revealed that the wicked walker came to the office every working morning at 7:00 p.m. to sign in the electronic system.
He immediately went home.
He again appeared at the workplace at 16:00, to once again note in the system that he left.
And so for 10 years.
It was also known that all the free time the walker dedicated to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking how to punish the direct head of Mr. Ratio, who could not know how to "actively work" on his workplace his subordinate.
The judges proposed to protect against the presidents
The President’s Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of power.
The Supreme Court proposes to limit the powers of the chairs of the courts and to introduce their electivity.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the SPC wants to introduce special districts that will not be bound to administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court shall also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The SPC has completed the development of proposals that will allow to strengthen the independence of the Russian justice.
This work was carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with the members of the Council.
At the meeting with the council members on 8 December 2016 discussed, among other things, individual cases of arbitration, as well as the issues of public control in prison places of citizens (see "Ъ" of 9 December).
The result of the work was 25 proposals, which concern both issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as financing courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the chairs of courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of a judge successfully passed the contest and received the support of the judge community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the Court of Justice, must present him to the appointment, without having the right to refuse, as now permitted by the law.
It is also proposed to deprive the Chairman of the right to distribute cases to judges.
To do this, experts allow, can a specially written computer program.
The president is not entitled to “definitise the results of the qualification certification of the judge, initiate his attraction to disciplinary responsibility, and make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments.”
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to the “election of the chairs of courts by the judges themselves” and “to assign their powers for a relatively short period with a mandatory rotation.”
Now all the presidents of courts (from the Republican to the District) are appointed for six years by the President on the presentation of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the CPI proposes a new way to organize appeal and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is linked to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
It is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts.
Experts take the basis of the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “judicial districts” which do not match the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which guarantee a greater independence from regional officials, which are difficult to use the “telephone right”.
The World Court of Justice proposes to strengthen the members of the People’s Assembly to discuss some “categories of civil and administrative matters” with their participation.
For example, on the deprivation of parental rights, on the restoration at work, on the protection of honor and dignity, on the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“This is just our proposals,” said the judge of the Constitutional Court in resignation, Tamara Morshakov, a member of the SPC.
She also reminded that the presidential mandate applied not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the Supreme Court, which has not yet revealed its proposals.
The time for the execution of the order at the Armed Forces (between the co-executive - the General Prosecutor's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) is still available.
Reporting to Vladimir Putin about how effectively the independence of justice is secured in the Russian Federation, the chairman of the Armed Forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, must until September 1.
Living a High Life: Half-Floor and Smart Design Practices Transformed This Small Apartment in Earl's Court into a Spatial Housing
Joanne Lee, a former bankier interested in real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a lovely typical house in Queen Anna's style, and in favour of the new design says that Joan has not collected her things and has not moved again.
“I’ve previously lived with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Erls Court, and there were the same high roofs.
I fell in love with her and offered a price the same day.”
Since the first view, the apartment of 1000 square feet has carried out a complete reconstruction.
Initially it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space for stuff storage and half-storey to get the maximum benefit from the generous height of the roofs.
“I wanted high roofs, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands,” she says.
For this purpose, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Duck & Shed architectural and design studio in Notting Hill to use roofs at 12.5 feet high and create a housing that would not only be a successful project but would fit Joan for life.
The roof was not high enough to arrange two rooms over each other, so the architectural task was to create a half-storey where it could be standing in full.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
“The work with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to place the rooms so that they were above each other, and we didn’t have to go down.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to throw the structures so that they were at the right height and allow the space to be used from above and from below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one over the other in the dedicated space – and a lot more interesting.
From the half-storey through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens a view of the elegant living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold decoration, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serzh Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The corridory is shaped with mirrors so that it looks longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protective panel looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror closet serves to store the whole dish of Joan.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can burn the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the kitchen.
The unique feature of this kitchen is that it is moving upward door as in a garage.
“Here was engaged in engineering art,” Erfan tells about the armored steel-fiber shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it’s very easy to jump.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage spaces, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the area of the sex is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued by,” says Erfan.
“Through speaking, the real estate trade agent will enter and make calculations based on the field area.”
Here they were able to increase the area of the fields using quality materials that give space shades of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one is in love with the electrical pipeline in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t put the strings of our hearts.”
This serves as proof that due to good design and increased metrage the apartment can turn from something normal to something amazing.
In fact, just like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approves the creation of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Russian government has approved the creation of a Commission on State Cultural Policy.
The corresponding ruling is published on the government’s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop projects of a cultural policy strategy, clarify the tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the commission is appointed by the deputy chairman of the government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the committee will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan for the implementation of the state cultural policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 countries decreased to the eight-year minimum
The growth of consumer prices in the G20 countries has dropped to the lowest levels in the last eight years, reports the Wall Street Journal with reference to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to the OECD estimates, the inflation rate in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Previously, Rosstat a 0.1% decline in Russia in the index of consumer prices.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
Mineconomics, however, believe that the target value has already been achieved - according to the version of this department, the indicator is 4%.
Putin warns of illegal breakdown of Baikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baykal territory warned against illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskaya noted that the bill was previously prepared.
It allows for the eruption of the forest during the eruption of the fires, and the government plans to accept it in the autumn.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of the drainage "there is not all drained in a row."
Donskaya noted that this bill implies control by the MSC and supervisory agencies.
Media: militants secretly from the command negotiate with the rebels of Donbass
On the line of the armed confrontation in the Donbass a regular telephone connection is established.
The fighters of the counterparts are constantly communicating with each other by mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
Fighters of the Armed Forces and the Donbass rebels communicated by cell phones secretly from their high command.
This was by Strana.ua on August 4 with reference to participants in the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not home: the commanders are trying to reach some "taxic agreements".
Often the result of such talks is a peace on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became known about cases when congratulations with the birthday of the officer received from the front line, from his formal enemy.
Fighters of the Armed Forces and rebels of the DNR and LNR are sitting on the border line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a fighting operation against the Donbass.
U.N. Secretary-Government blocked U.N. Security Council statements about attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Policy Department is angry by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block the UN Security Council's press statements condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2th was subjected to a minomet bombing for the third time a month by the terrorists of the group "Hayat Tahriir Ash-Sham" (former "Jabhat al-Nusra", prohibited in the Russian Federation) and "Faylak Ar-Rahman".
Considering that the international community unanimously qualifying Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, it is in itself understood that the Nusra attacks should encounter universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessments of outlets against diplomatic representations should not be any ambiguity."
For the third time a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, variing the tone of objections, hiding the arguments of alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft of the Security Council statement for the press with condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic office in the Syrian capital.
The refusal to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us may remain on the conscience of these delegations.
“The most disgusting thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the actions of the terrorists encourages them to new provocations and attacks, makes them feel impunity,” the ministry said, adding that “it would not want these barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin Approves the Limitation of the Number of Off-Planed Business Inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during the meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also said the need to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
“Outside inspections are carried out, as a rule, without the appropriate agreement with the prosecutor’s office; only 2-3% agree with the prosecutor’s office, the rest goes independently,” TASS said.
Vladimir Putin also said it should be forbidden for investigators to remove servers and hard drives on enterprises.
In addition, the President believes that business unions should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive in the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity, or related to law breach in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
Due to the action of the moratorium to carry out the planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman at the President of Russia Boris Tytov, a survey was conducted, resulting in which it was revealed that in fact there was a replacement of the planned checks with unplanned (the share of those encountered increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens' statements (growth from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fight for a real estate worth more than $500 million
The two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in the state of Victoria empires in the real estate trade worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton football club and founder Colin de Luthis lives in the Palace of Turak through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a lawsuit against him to the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a strong dispute about the conditions of divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 assets worth more than half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in 1973.
There the family founded the company “Westco Jeans”, which grew into a network of 160 stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of possessions of the De Luthis family includes today office buildings, under-built areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Coast and in Mount Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to the agreement with the deceased father Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant person" of the De Luthis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul - about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's ownership is 316 million, and Paul's ownership is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stone of collision for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful reconciliation attempts, the first hearing was held at the Supreme Court.
Brothers are now discussing who will control the existing business – from which, Paul believes, Colin has excluded it.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider the family to be the highest priority,” he wrote.
The court expenses are rising as a snowcut: the case includes hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides have attracted the most famous lawyers, including the royal lawyer Alan Mayers, and the best lawyers.
Miss De Luthis and her deceased husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they managed dairy bars and gastronomies, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees they bought a store in Collingwood, where Collin opens the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last classes of school and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years)".
Anna de Luthis says they and Louisiana, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi often told me he doesn’t want the brothers to go to court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Luthis Group; Colina says Mark received 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “unhappy with the financial conditions of their department.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL board and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He only answered Colin, a text message in which it was said that, since the case was not yet discussed in the court, "I really have nothing to say."
“I am very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to file a lawsuit against me and put the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not want to see how we and Paul are disputing in the court," he said, adding that "all still hopes for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seemed to disappear.
"The decision on our case will soon be brought by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump’s apparatus plans to restrict the entry of information to the president.
Others tried to do this and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House apparatus plans to restrict the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the head in a more quiet state.
This is what the reporter Josh Dousi says.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House apparatus John F. Kelly with the head of the apparatus on his first working day, he pointed out the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told employees that information should pass through him – in paper form or through briefings – because the president would be better to make decisions if he would get the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is completely true, but others have already failed trying to calm Trump, tracking the entry of information to him.
President Trump’s relationship with television was formed a few decades ago – and now, when he is in the White House, his habit of watching television remains strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was angry with the unfair lighting of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he was receiving fair lighting in the publications that could be convinced,” said Sam Nanberg, former counselor of the electoral headquarters in February.
Tara Palmery then wrote in Politico that “the words of six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter under control, it was necessary to keep a constant flow of praise in the personally received information to him.”
well .
But the idea that Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter has ever been “under control” is just funny.
Per these members of the electoral headquarters know something that we don’t know, for example, that if they were not, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never learn about tweets that Trump has not published.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not useless.
But no one managed to keep Trump from swallowing oil into fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into competing factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda, giving Trump material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of counselors to constantly encourage the president to doubtful information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former officials say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous information leaks, and will not calm until he finds who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone pushed the president to print an article from GotNews.com, the website of the internet provokator Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus, Katy Walsh, was accused of being “through the escape” in the White House.
It doesn’t matter if Johnson is forever charged on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he has not presented specific facts or that in the past he has launched false accusations and then rejected them.
Trump read the article and decided to ask employees about Welsh."
Goldmacher added that the then head of the apparatus, Reynes Pribus, and the secretary of the apparatus, Rob Porter, "seeked to build a system to control the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more efficient manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants continue to fight for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The Prosecutor's Office is fighting a HIV dissident
The Prosecutor's Office has challenged the ruling of the Kaliningrad District Court of Thumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident whose child died from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was HIV disident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from liability in connection with reconciliation with the victim's father.
The prosecutor's opinion is that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tumeni was initiated in accordance with Article 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (the cause of death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV-infection 4B stage.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the mother itself is HIV infected.
"The woman was not treated by herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there is no HIV infection," the prosecutor's office said.
The criminal case was brought to the Kaliningrad District Court of Thumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The request was submitted by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "he forgiven his wife, he has no claims to her, she smoothed harm and apologized."
The Prosecutor's Office did not agree with the court's decision and appealed, requiring the cancellation of the decision on the termination of the case and sending it to a new consideration.
The girl has died, and the damage caused by the crime is impossible.
A HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection," the prosecutor's press service said.
According to the supervisory body, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
As in the Tumen AIDS Center, now in the Tumen region about 12 children with HIV are not receiving medical care because of the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - in a year of work of a special group, half of the parents, who categorically refused to treat children for HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to make a diagnosis, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, the legislative way to influence parents is impossible, and as a result, not all HIV infected children can be detected - mothers do not let them be examined, hide, flee with children from hospitals.
What are the risks of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first in Russia study of the so-called HIV dissidents movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medications.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical and see a serious threat in their spread.
A junk photo session, which ended with a tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechana railway station in Chmelnitsk.
A joyful company of drunken young people walked by the bridge over the railways, where just a cargo train stood.
One of the friends came up with the idea to make an impressive selfie on the roof of the wagon, FACTAM in the communication sector of the police in the Khmelnitsk region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but due to his invisibility, he stuck behind the electricity line and immediately got a blow of the current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station’s supervisor, who immediately caused a “emergency.”
Before the arrival of the doctors the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the fire department of the Khmelnitsk region clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of 1–2 degrees.
Currently, his condition is considered stable by doctors.
The law enforcement officials remind that in recent years, extreme selfies are getting increasingly popular on the roofs of multi-storey, bridges, moving transportation.
Police urge people to be cautious and not allow such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists admit the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
In ancient Venus there could be oceans.
This is the conclusion of French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It was revealed that at the beginning of its history, the ocean was formed, which had 10 percent more water than it is now on Earth.
Previously, the Week’s Arguments wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts during their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Shooting in San Francisco Park injured three people
Three people were injured in a shooting in San Francisco, Associated Press reports.
The incident occurred in the Dolores Park, where there was a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began to scream threats.
One of them took the weapon and started shooting people.
The appearance of the offenders could not be considered, as they had everything closed except the eyes.
Another man was given medical care, after which he was released.
The third injured is a minor, no details about his condition.
Located on the hill, Dolores Park is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured during a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the room.
Rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The Louna rock band's concert will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The collective is preparing a concept show, which will be the brightest in the group's concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album of the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is associated with O. Huxley's famous antiutopia novel "On a wonderful new world".
The new songs don’t tell the book, but tell about a society that lives according to the law of antiutopia, “blind faith in propaganda and imposed values.”
The group was helped to collect money for the album record: on the website "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1,200 people.
His first album, “Give a Louna!” was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We're Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group performed with a symphonic orchestra at the Crocus City Hall with the program Songs of the World.
In the composition of the group Lucine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas-gitar), Ruben Kazarian (gitar), Sergey Ponkratyev (gitar), Leonid Kinsburgsky (barabans).
The concert will be held in the Barnaul club "Faraon" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the popular groups on the Russian rock scene.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group has several times won in different nominations of the hit parade "Churto Dujina".
The Cigans Overcome the Rope and Return to “Millionaire Street”
Some of the wealthiest household owners in the West Midland are again in conflict with determined Cigans who have overcome the outbreak by the municipal authorities to again occupy the field near their homes.
The Cigans parked 20 houses on wheels in the field bordering with the rich Solihall Street, which got the joke name “Millionaire Street”.
Bringing with them horses, babies, and many houses on the wheels, they returned after they were expelled not further than in May, and they were not hindered by the row that the municipal authorities had thrown out to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breakthrough in defence buildings and countered its vehicles through the area they left unblocked to leave a place for the trophy.
The distressed inhabitants attacked the municipality of Solihall, saying it was “unable to solve this problem.”
An anonymous local resident said, “They came here on Monday evening, after they were thrown out of Bentley Heath, where they wrapped stones in the passengers.”
The municipality should be shy and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Cigans were here in May, they were persecuted, and here they came back again.
Last night there were even more Cigans, and today, even more.
“The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court rulings to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on the Straitsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I continue to pay municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even end it.”
One local resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said, “It’s funny, we’ve just seen these cigans leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time they became more, and we even saw a horse passing on the shore.”
A representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: “We know about the illegal camp on the ground near the Stritsbrook Road and we work with Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible.”
To help us in the process of collecting evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by telephone 101.
This allows us to make an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the Champagne Wine Factory "New Light"
GUP of the Republic of Crimea "The Champagne Wine Factory "New Light" decided to share, transforming it into the OAO "The Champagne Wine Factory "New Light", according to the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anjuhina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in state ownership of Crimea.
The statutory capital of the stock company will be 595,5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares of a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea said that if there are no funds for the modernization of the plant in the next three years, there will be a threat to stop the plant.
The amount of funds in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the characteristics of the organizational and legal form it is obliged to give 50% of the profits to the budget income.
What remains is not enough for the implementation of the modernization plan.
“To get money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting loans from large credit organizations is difficult,” the deputy chief minister of the Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament has included the company in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to make his shares and to be placed on sale.
The source "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of the company's sale in $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
"New Light" in 2016 increased the production of playful wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, “New Light” intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Leo Golitsyn as a plant for the production of playful wine in his ownership New Light.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod Third-class members defeated more than 40 tombs
The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region established the personalities of citizens who destroyed 46 tombs at the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The offenders were third-class students.
The first statement that the tomb plates were damaged by the unknown, was submitted to the Russian Ombudsman for the Lyskov district on June 27.
A total of 24 people appealed to the police.
The criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or contamination of the places of burial".
According to the results of the investigation, the police found the suspects, they found two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Mankind criminals told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, and that led them to humiliating actions.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy has strengthened the tone towards NGO ships that rescue migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs owned by Mediterranean rescue ships that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules regulating their activities.
“If NGOs do not obey the new Code of Conduct, it’s hard to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
The Minnesota warning came the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet", suspected that its crew actually cooperates with human traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working for a year, has refused to comment on the substance of detailed accusations against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
“For us, the rescue of human lives is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very regret that we can’t continue our activities in the search and rescue zone now,” the organization said in a statement.
“We will be able to evaluate all the accusations presented now, only after we collect all the information and can evaluate the situation.”
The Italian authorities are monitoring the ship "Juventus", which belongs to "Jugend Rettet", from October.
His crew is suspected of taking the migrants on board with whole rescue boats, which human traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing the traffickers to leave along with the boats they could reuse.
At least one such meeting, as is expected, took place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the allegations, the content of which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities that control the rescue operations in the area, rather from humanitarian ruins than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct implies, mainly, that the “Juventus” type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Until now, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the code: "Save Children", Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Extended Arms" from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they will not bring any "significant changes or interference" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Miniti said that the sharp decline in the recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coastal guard and cooperation with the local mayor are bringing fruit.
“In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to associate with any of the sides of the conflict."
The Russian authorities have recently significantly activated their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow participated delegations of the opposing Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement at the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant head of the Czech Republic Lev Dengov told "Ъ", what objectives Moscow is pursuing in this region and on whom it makes a bet.
About the contact group in Libya you are leading, almost nothing is known.
Here, let’s say, the contact group in Ukraine – everyone knows about it.
Here is the curtain of the secret.
What exactly do you do, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Her activities are curated by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Duma Deputy from Chechnya. - "Ъ").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Vladimir.
The key to the creation of the group was the arrest in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mehanik Chobotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Ъ").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group was created from military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, our work was supported by the Chief of the Czech Republic Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you find that you were the leader?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I was asked to head the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the "Mechanika Chobotareva".
We managed to establish contacts with the representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the recognized UN government is based on the head of Faiz Sarajem. - "Ъ"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "Ъ").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya’s Vice-Premier – “Ъ”), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all sides of the conflict.
I want to emphasize: in Libya we don’t want to associate with any of the sides of the conflict, we have dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are currently five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in force structures, including in the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to incorporate a group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAN.
There are no employees in Libya, and there is no need to do so.
There are now Russian military advisors and instructors in Libya.
If so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But in your contact group the former soldiers are ...
And their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot points.
Or such closed to a certain point for us cities, such as Missurata (where the rebellion troops that played a role in the defeat of the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly activated in the subsequent years are based).
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why such rumors go, what the role of Islamists is actually there.
In Missurate we met with all the representatives of the troops that were engaged in the destruction of the Islamic State in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was overturned by the militants of the prohibited Islamic State in Russia - "Ъ").
We wanted to look at them, to get acquainted with these people, to check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of the Islamic State in Libya, and not the Khalifa Haftar who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Is the “Islamic State” in Libya not defeated by Haftar?
This was not he doing.
Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And with the Islamic State in Sirte struggled structures who were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people to Russia who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April of this year, the Libyan delegation was accepted in the Federation Council, in Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Rosgvardi.
You, as we have understood, are in all the Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field leaders.
How do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarage?
Or again, as it has been repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be broken down, combat actions will be renewed, the parties will try to unilaterally take power?
For us a good signal has already been the fact that Sarage and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the past, the two leaders have been extremely negative on each other.
As for Russia’s position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We encountered this situation when they were in Misurat, and Haftar was on that day on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was coincidence.
But in Missouri they did not believe in coincidence.
They told us, “You are probably very brave people who came to us right today.”
But our task is just to show: we do not only support Haftar, we do dialogue with all key parties in the conflict in Libya.
You talked with Haftar.
Does the mutual understanding with the Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
If you know Russian, it is relatively.
But what he learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet the generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
They speak well in Russian.
And they pull to Russia, somewhat experience nostalgia on it.
Do you think it is possible for the immediate abolition of the arms embargo on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I’ve said, we don’t take any side in this conflict and don’t want to arm one to the other.
We would like everyone to be in equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyan people that Russia should somehow contribute to its withdrawal.
Currently, the process of drawing up the constitution is in progress in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to a compromising solution and reach internal consensus.
Then elections should be held, as was stated at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such status), then the UN Security Council can put the question of removing the arms embargo.
To raise this question is now meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
In recent days, the media that Italy, facing the problem of African refugees flying from Libya, feels arbitrarily abandoned by its EU allies.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners by using its ties with the Libyan?
How realistic is, for example, the possibility that the Haftar troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of the smugglers who send immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is conducting dialogue simultaneously with Haftair, and with Sarajevo, and with Missouri and the south of the country.
The tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the Southers to cross the streams of migrants on remote approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, the buses to which Nigerian migrants travel were turned back?
We are seeking that.
But it is not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in the continuation of these flows.
We hope to contribute to the unification of the South in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftair and the tribes in the south.
But in the beginning we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftair and Saraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Sarage, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of sharia norms in the country.
How many radical views does he hold?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
Islamists are in the coalition.
Yes, but he himself adheres to the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – moderate Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does this reputation come from?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not getting there.
And we mixed all the maps and began to communicate actively with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we’re already eating the fruit of this work: Rosneft has signed an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya – NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefty Igor Sechin had a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil was made by Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I think to sell again.
What are the economic interests of Russia in Libya?
The plans are to re-sign contracts concluded with Muammar al-Qaeda.
It is about previous agreements in the transport sector (Railway construction), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Does the Libyan have something to pay?
They have oil.
That is, as in the case with Iran, it is a “oil in exchange for services” scheme?
I don’t know what the scheme will be, I don’t deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the most important.
We are actually working on peace.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyan people agree with each other so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and expelling terrorists from there.
Do you have data about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that at the moment there is no exit from Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said he had about 50 thousand records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Ъ") and the Russian speech there doesn't sound.
And from which countries are these militants?
I’t want to go into these details.
Then we formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyan among them, they are not more than 5%.
The rest are coming.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan talks on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are conducting active talks with the Libyan people, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their willingness to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It is hard to say now.
There are still a few visits to be held, and then I hope there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, charitants gathered money for a precious gift to the sick boy
In the sub-Moscow museum-concern "Melikovo" the nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has a DCP, a hydrocephaly of the brain and full blindness, will receive a specialized runway as a gift on August 5.
The useful presentation will be awarded to Sasha, the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksan Kosarev and the Director of the Museum, Konstantin Bobkov.
Money for the training was collected during the charitable marathon "Don't tired of doing good" which took place in Melihov on July 15 on the Day of Remembrance of Chechov.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum, Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkin in the Czech region, received a letter: "I don't see the eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I’d really like to get a runway as a gift so that my legs become strong, and I’d just learn to walk.”
And this is the dream of Sasha!
After the delivery in the museum-concerto will take place "Concert-postscript" - the famous pianist, the deserved artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will fulfill the popular popular classic works.
During the charitable marathon in Melichov, the chorus of the Dawid Desert of Uzbekistan, the callers of the workshop of Ilya Drozdychin, the students of the Moscow Conservatory named P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named Gnesin, the artists of the Melichov Theatre "Chechovskaya Studio".
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair and a charitable sale of souvenirs products with the logo of the marathon were organized.
The commander-museum "Melikovo" made the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chechov on July 15 a single day of charity in all sub-Moscow museums.
A 30-year-old inhabitant of the Olevsk Zhytomirsk region near the local football stadium several times shot in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry by noise, the "FACTAM" in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomirsk region.
After that, the man went to a cafe nearby.
In his building there was a conflict, during which the man applied a device to shoot with gums, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old has been given the necessary medical care, no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services arrived at the place of the incident, but the shooter escaped at the time.
The law enforcement officials confirmed his identity and arrested him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has a device to shoot gums, which is sent to the examination.
Criminal proceedings under Article 296 (Huliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

Michelle Carter sentenced for reports that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months of his deadline and another 5 years of trial.
Carter was convicted in June of the unintended murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family was killed in the evil.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream bluz, listened to the judgment standing, pressing his hands and leaving his eyes.
“With her actions she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor said.
She broke her life to improve her.
She did not recognize responsibility,” she said.
“She did not show regrets.”
But the lawyer Carter said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, judge Lawrence Monis said that, according to him, "her age, level of maturity or even a mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read the statements of Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying: "There has not been a day I would not complain about the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I’m dealing with – I’m trying to support his sister despite all the pain that will remain with us forever.”
Roy's sister, Camden Roy, said she was irresponsibly pursued by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“To miss a person who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case seems to be a legal precedent, as in Massachusetts there is no law that would provide for the responsibility for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang, jump from the roof, kill yourself with a knife I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before his death when he rested with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide she wrote, “You have to do this, Conrad,” and “You just have to turn the fire into and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through the death of Roy, and banned her from communicating with the press in order to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of the lawyers on this matter are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Noks, who was sentenced in 2007 for killing her British neighbor in Italy by apartment and justified two years later.
The 30-year-old Nox published her special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, saying, “Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison.”
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I released Langford like a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players of the United League, the 33-year-old Kit Langford has left the UNICEF.
The departure of the U.S. defendant "Izvestiam" was commented by UNICEF President Yevgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision on the basis of family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a little child, a wife who didn’t want to move to Kazan.
Kitty wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played in the UNIX three seasons and in each match showed a high level, exposed to all 100%.
So I released him like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and game career.
Kitt Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the Single League 2015/16.
In the season 2016/17 he received the award to the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He earned 21.75 points in an average per match.
This is the second result since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague to receive this award more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China’s Shenzhen company, Eurohoops reports.
The American is expected to conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second star of the Euroleague in July, which will move to the Chinese championship.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA passed the ex-center "Panatinaikos" Janis Burusis.
Burned in the sun tourist from Moscow evacuated by helicopter in Adige
Adigean rescuers today with a helicopter evacuated from the mountainous area of the republic of a sub-Moscow tourist who received the strongest solar burns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fist", located at an altitude of 1,6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure and breathing difficulties.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The head of the group told the rescuers that the man had been burned.
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would propose to update the software for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW’s chairman said the company believes that “there are more intelligent roads than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where the BMW is located – which were considering the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel output.
None of the companies called their step a feedback.
European automotive manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with CO2 emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that are released by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automotive manufacturers to install equipment that neutralizes diesel gases is also increasing, andining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automotive manufacturers are closely attentive, Angela Merkel’s government also accused it of tracking influential automotive manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the errors of the Volkswagen, which hidden the use of so-called “damag devices” which during testing could counter the amount of emitted harmful gases so that it meets the rules, and in the usual driving conditions turned off.
In the United States, several leaders of the “Folkswagen” have been sentenced, the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former chief of the termodynamics department in the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and may appear before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was undergoing a German criminal investigation with the participation of Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation, which was previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the elite car manufacturer is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s income.
In Astrahani, a cafe visitor paid for false money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank’s department about the discovery of a suspicious banknotes named 5 thousand rubles during the recount of the funds that came from the food point.
A study conducted at the Expert and Criminal Center has shown that it is false.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia in the Astrahan region, the banknotes were paid by one of the cafe visitors who bought a shurma.
It is worth noting that the cash was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the banknotes.
Currently, police are establishing persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punished by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls on the residents of the Astrahan region to be careful when doing financial transactions; workers of the trade facilities are advised to install tools to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have discovered a “heavenly” planet on which even iron can float
For the first time studying the properties of the stratosphere of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astronomers were greatly surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noted that the water molecules are so heated by the star's light that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the radiation of the water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the atmosphere of the planet to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "heat Jupiter" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the Solar System, but located tens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "terrestrial" days, and its gas coating is roughly up to 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become the symbol of Provence and South France, but now there are concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda became worse due to the dry weather and the disease of insects; this was the cause of the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shess, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: “Lavanda in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has felt the consequences of climate change: in spring and especially in autumn the rain has become much less.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there are still small cycades jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they become very many.”
There is a lot on the map.
Lavender not only attracts vacancies; Lavender oil is highly sought in perfume and cosmetology.
Eric Shess says: “Instead of very long wheels with a large number of large flowers, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or entirely absent.
Therefore, we have fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
The solutions that are currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of garlic and water and removing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The Ambassador of the Winter University-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk students
The twice world hockey champion, the 2019 Winter University Ambassador Alexander Semin met the previous day with beginners hockey players and distributed autographs to fans.
The meeting took place at the Winter Universiade 2019 in the framework of a theme week dedicated to hockey with shayba.
Any visitor of the telt could ride on the canyons on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, staffets, victories and games were organized with the play of souvenirs products of student games, the distribution from the Federation of Aerobics.
50 students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the kids as much as possible to engage in the sports fields and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and great desire to engage in hockey.
"It's good that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a square as the Winter Universiade 2019, where beginner athletes can ask questions directly to team coaches," the champion said.
Let’s note that promoting student sports and a healthy lifestyle among the Russians helps the Ambassadors of the Winter University-2019.
The Chatter University will work throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Directorate of the Winter University-2019.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
The official representative of the U.S. Department of State, Heather Nawert, commenting on the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find "a area for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to “better bilateral interaction.”
A example of such successful cooperation, Nawert called the peace agreement on Syria.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia must be able to work with each other,” she said.
He refused to comment on Medvedev’s statement on a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said this, then it, of course, has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about this topic," the Deputy Deputy spokesman said.
Previously, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington has declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions will be in force for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes that the U.S. establishment “aboutly overcome” Trump.
The missing bodybuilder found a lost memory in a foreign house
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Naginsk on July 25 under very picant circumstances: he went out of the car’s salon to go to the toilet.
For seven days, he was unsuccessfully sought by familiar and local residents.
And Shamil was found on a stranger dache in Ramensk.
The owner found him completely naked in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete was unable to explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
Identification helped announce his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived at the call recorded a partial loss of memory and a cerebral injury in Hanmetov, the Mash publication reports.
Athletes are likely to have other surprises.
The criminals who kidnapped Shamil probably had already visited his apartment, the keys from which he was also stolen.
Oil and gas revenue in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The real oil and gas revenue in July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The excess, as the agency explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used to assess, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil exports to the forecast levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019 years, in August 2017 is predicted in the amount of +40,2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds sent to the purchase of foreign currency on the internal currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of the purchase of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2,07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to the purchase of foreign currency by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Each working day during the specified period the Central Bank will conclude transactions of purchase of foreign currency on the organized shops of the Moscow Stock Exchange equally during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be registered on the Federal Treasury account in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that in Mexico it is becoming more and more dangerous.
The staff of the weekly newspaper "Riyodose" usually meet on Wednesday to discuss plans to illuminate the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the continuing war of narcotics.
But today, suppressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seems safer: take children with you to the office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009 or leave them home.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column – evidence is not needed, suspicions and inner sensations will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious of being held by the government or the cartridges, a whole list of subjects, which makes work on illuminating the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give a breath, and among the bodies that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, not less than 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year already at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of "Riyodose" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Waldes wrote in one of his numerous books about drug-related violent crimes.
His absence feels very sharp, although his presence everywhere - a large photo of Valdes, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hangs on the facade of the building "Riyodose"; two reporters of the year 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear shorts on which his smile, face in glasses or his firm panama are shown.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate journalism cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with the majority of the thousands of murders committed each year, associated with drug trafficking and organized crime, murders of journalists rarely appear before the court.
The journalists of Rio de Janeiro insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they were killed in the worst, although around now it is far more dangerous.
Without information about the murders, without justice from talks about security at meetings, there is no benefit, says Ibarra.
“It’s very stupid to spend time on this seminar,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know the cause, we suspect everyone.”
In the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of Rio de Janeiro in the capital of the state of Kuliakane.
He managed to travel only a couple of quarters before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot into it 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "The Twelve River".
The shooter left his car and broke it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
The rumors usually spread quickly through the Culiacan.
But about Valdes almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and released in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody fields of battle in the country as competing factions are struggling to fill the formed vacuum.
Let’s not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with painted two-storey mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the houses of many living people.
Let’s forget for a moment that the state of “peace” is just when one of the cartridges takes control of the coastal state with important ports and routes of drug trafficking leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of the Rio de Janeiro, was dismissed by the feeling of guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He believes that two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the competing cartel factions that fights with Guzman's sons.
The publication could rage the sons; people who were supposedly members of the band picked up all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosk.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own security after another newspaper was captured that wrote about the same story.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as a rear step in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so long away from the danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at "Noroeste" and in 2003 together with five colleagues founded "Riyodose", selling his $50 shares.
"It was impossible to engage in journalism without touching the topic of drugs," Bohorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper deserved the reputation of a brave and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists liked that they could publish courageous reports without fear of censorship, and readers attracted that in this edition they could read about what no one was daring to write.
Eight years after its foundation, Rio de Janeiro was awarded the prestigious Mary Moors Cabo Award for her journalist work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for the courage to investigate the drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it goes.
He honestly acknowledged he was afraid.
“I want to live further,” he said at the CPJ award.
Narcotic trafficking in Sinaloa is "this is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompevento TV in October last year.
“You have to take tasks that lie on you as a journalist – either, or you’re just a fool.”
I don’t want me to be asked, “What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn’t you say what’s happening?”
“Riyodose’s employees miss Valdes, a joke man who wandered like a carrier in the port, a friend, a generous man on his arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to get alive.
They rely on the order they had.
He always had to wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, a bar opposite the office, and always sitting there behind the same chair.
Now they’re asking: was his love for the once established order destroyed?
His death has forced them to doubt in their calculations of how best they can do their work and stay alive.
“They don’t like when you get into their wives, children, their legal business and underground airports for drug transportation.
“These things were behind the line,” Bohorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-protection.
You have to believe in your instincts.
Keep away from what smells badly.
The problem, says Riyodose editor Andres Villarreal, is that “thinking can be deceived... and then happens what happened to Havier.”
The old rules, he says and others, no longer work in Sinaloa – as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guérrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling roads, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Rio de Janeiro staff gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to use mobile phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
On the outside, two police officers are hidden in the shadow of a tree of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to protect the office of Riodose, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois Quarter of Kuliakan.
Some journalists have half-shut asked whether these police officers are not among those 50 percent of the officers of the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of a gang of drug traffickers.
In the nearest number, "Ryodose" counted on three main topics.
It is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had the disclosure of government expenses concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakan, in the neighborhood from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was the favorite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered on behalf of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of power for almost the last century.
Recently, a number of governors from the PRI were accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the previous incidents in the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo, Guzman, escaped from the military cloud.
A few months ago, readers would look for the valds column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would already know what happened before," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, for his artistic bodybuilding called "El Flasco".
“Today, all the channels of communication with our sources are broken down.”
The Waldes Cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the murders of journalists because employees have become what they never thought to be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
The body was found burned and the authorities said it was on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists across the country began to speak louder, organize protests and write “SOS Press” on the routes and walls of houses.
On that day, the director Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to obtain international support in demanding justice in the case of Valdes.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the next day after the assassination of Valdes, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying for journalists and ordering their murders for saying the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more tasks to illuminate the government’s activities, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdes has repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are “circumcised” by organized crime, its co-participants in the government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book "Drug Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not murdered by just a gang of drug traffickers; they do it according to the orders of politicians and security services in conspiracy with organized crime.
The press protection committee "Article 19" believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed on the order of police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to catch you,” Ramires says.
Of course, murders scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massia six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
She found a note on her body, supposedly written from the face of Zetas: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headsets lie next to her cut head.
Some publications prefer to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Britch was killed in March.
Others continue to hold as "El Manjana" from Noévo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Sudad Huarez publicly appealed to drug cartels with the help of an editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their native states or the country at all.
This is a sad decision.
In exile, it’s hard to find a job, and they’re still looking at the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it obviously happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance between risky decisions every day.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - acknowledges that he's afraid to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I’ve become a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last edition was already ready for printing, the publishers of the Rio de Janeiro sat on the trail next to the office and drank beer, when suddenly their phones were called at the same time.
A series of shootings between the fighting gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 bodies behind, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to burn, as promised in a series of messages from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the trail, they posted news via their mobile phone on the Rio de Janeiro website.
The next day we had to rebuild the first page.
In the vicinity, the sirens were shattered - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked at whether their guarders were ready to defend.
If they were scared, they did not show it.
Sitting under the enormous portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the sight of the whole Sinaloa, the Riyodose employees continued his work.
“How can you think about closing,” Bohorkes said, “if the day when Havier was killed, a practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report?”
The dinosaur used a camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance it looks like a statue, though terrible.
The researchers that the first found remains of an incredible creature of the size of a nursery, discovered by a Canadian miner, were so well preserved that experts called it the "Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scratched skin was red and brown – and to say that he had, in some way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the Journal of Modern Biology, it was described as “the best preserved from the Tireophorus throughout the history of discoveries and one of the best copies of the dinosaur in the world.”
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the melo period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good condition has shocked the researchers who call it “really wonderful.”
This herbal thyrophorus is the best preserved mining of this species in its history, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Fank when he worked on the Millennium mining company Sancor near the Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He found something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look more carefully.
The mines they found were sent to the Royal Tyrellov Paleontological Museum.
The following six years were carried out for the detection of the animal inside the earth's depth of 2500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It's just a little bit to feel, and you can practically believe that he's sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell's Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved copies of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbicide, despite the fact that it was covered with a pancreas and resembled a walking tank, was apparently exposed to a significant danger by fat-eating dinosaurs.
This powerful pancreas-covered dinosaur used a red-white camouflage to hide from hostages, and used a protective technique known as a protective paint that is also used by many animals of our days.
This would allow him to merge faster with the environment and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, assuming that larger dinosaurs were hunted on him.
This 110 million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaurus family, was widely illuminated in the press in May, and is now on an exhibition in the Royal Tyrell's Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laborator Mark Mitchell, one of the group’s participants who spent more than 7,000 hours on his crop-thinking excavation.
The surprising preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the painting and shape of the sheets and pancreas plaques on his body.
They discovered a protective colour, a common method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective colour is well distributed, the discovery became an unexpected event, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur significantly exceeds the size of today living animals with the protective colour.
It can be assumed that the dinosaurs were so actively hunted on this dinosaur that evolution preferred masking confrontation as a way of survival.
But most of the modern animals with a protective colour – for example, oils, zebras, or armor – are much smaller and are more affordable to harvest, which indicates that the nodosaurus had to seriously fight for survival.
“The serious threat by the hostages to a massive, powerful pancreas-covered dinosaur shows how dangerous the hostage dinosaurs of the Melov period were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur cushion also indicates that its skin should have been red and brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the preserved content of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he drowned and backed down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in the south of Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to spread far further into the depths of the land than it is now.
“This nodosaver is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with a preserved coughed skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original form of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Pearl Period.
You don’t need to take particular attention to the imagination to re-create it, it’s just worth a bit of touch, and you can almost believe that it’s sleeping.”
The Melo period is the time when giant teropods, the fat-eaten dinosaurs standing on two legs, flew over the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could hunt the thyrophorus.
The number of them includes an acro-cantosaur, a monster of 38 feet (11,5 meters) weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the Journal of Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was thrown into the sea after his death and mummified in the slope.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he worked on the Millennium mine near the Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum’s staff, it is the best preserved thyrophorus in the world, along with the skin and pancreas, and it is a target, from the mord to the bone marrow.
On average, these beings reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic character was two twenty-inch spots out of the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbal thyrophorus was heavily trapped on what is now Canada until the floating river brought it to the open sea.
But the submarine burial of the dinosaur preserved his pancreas with accuracy to the smallest details.
The stone remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by bulk pancreas along the dinosaur scalp.
As Michael Greško wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of conservation is “rare as winning in a lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The stone remains of the skin are still covered by bulk pancreatic plates that seam the animal's neck.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count the shells on his floor.”
Mikhail Saakashvili arrived in Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously led Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
He did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival is by the Polish newspaper Telewizja Republika, which posted a video with his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw rebellion against the Hitler troops in 1944.
Because the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched the topics of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
About the fact that the migration service of Ukraine has deprived his citizenship, a dangerous politician learned, being in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents, it is not yet known.
Earlier, former Governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was falsified.
The politician stressed that he did not fill any inquiries.
The prosecution in the case of Weinziger and Olhovik extended to January.
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-ownership of the company group "Renova" Yevgeny Olchovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinzhir was extended to January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman Court is discussing the question of the extension of the accused's domestic arrest.
The representative of the Commission at the meeting announced the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
“Special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to withdraw and conduct the examination of a large number of documents, as well as the conduct of investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation,” the investigator said.
He added that the suspects were regularly giving assassinations to Comey's leadership.
The total size is estimated at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzier, Olhovik, as well as the former head of the "Complex Energy Systems" ZOO Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vimpelkom", transferred to the top officials of the Republic of Komi considerations for establishing the most profitable tariffs on heat and electricity, as well as for creating favourable conditions for the business.
Weinzier and Olhovik were arrested, staged to Syktivkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was announced in federal search.
How one activist learned the answer to the question “Who’s the streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depth of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York, as part of a tourist trip, St. Louis's cousin sat on his bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on his phone.
She got on the post of someone from high school.
“The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and he still lies in the middle of the street.”
Noting that no one in her tape has left this information, confused, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In her tape there were a lot of user posts with the nick @TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper from the Great St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, eighteen-year-old black teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's unlife body, spread in the middle of the street, where it will be for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening returned to the tweet that people gathered on the Kenfield Drive.
There were photographs of the signal tape and the crying people and the man who claimed he was Brown’s father, who made the poster with the words: “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched the live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a laughing dog.
On another video, another police officer, she told me, took a chicken of the shell and spoke, “I’m going to kill you all... animals!”
“This is a non-standard situation,” – according to his own memories, Ferrell said then.
“This is not such a murder as those we are accustomed to and which we can call typical.
At that moment I felt a snorkel.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a ticket for the return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father’s house and decided that they both would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years has become the theme of the new documentary “Who’s the streets?”, which will be released on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrell was traveling to Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a flower dress and a colored vein, they remembered a conversation that tells to this morning countless times, “on the experience of the black and their position.”
She recalls how she said, “Do you remember how I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t get her away,” Ferrell said later.
What happens today is the culmination of what happened before.
She must know about it, see it, and grow up on it.
It should not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience and their position and what we need to do to become free to get free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she personally will not face obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel it would be a bad service to her if I would regain her from it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop on the South-Florissant-Road, on a square located through the road from a police station that became something like a palace camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of the outcome of the unpunishment of officer Derren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who prepared lanch packages.
They gathered packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
A little bit in the mind, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at Missouri-Saint-Lewis University, she was the president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and was engaged in food justice and inequality in health among black communities.
“I didn’t have the experience of the organizer.
It came alone.”
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba Folaan, one of his co-regisors.
Folaan said that she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell asked, “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play?”
This skepticism was overwhelmed by numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As she explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson are not at the center of attention, and they wanted to do it differently.”
Folaan at that time had joined with his co-register, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the matters of the sentenced to death.
His participation raised sympathy to the project with Ferrell and six other local residents, with whom the project team “Who’s the streets?”ined contact over the years after Brown’s murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, that’s what we say,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people will be presented, because it is how I will be presented.”
And although the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – in the desire to show that the movement “is not about the leader-save, but about how the community unites,” as Folaan said – it turned out to be the most open among the participants of the film.
As a result, in “Who’s the streets?” there are suddenly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing and speaking about how I first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that when you do such a job and face black people, there should be a certain level of vulnerability.”
Furthermore, the story of Ferrell again discusses and emphasizes the role of black gay women in a broader context of the movement “The life of black women is important.”
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social networks after the murder of the black teen Travon Martin in 2012 – classify themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in the leadership positions support all this movement,” Ferrell says, “and all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folaan agreed to this statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a number of gay black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive characteristics.
“She was the man who awakened that energy,” she said.
"On the other hand, it's not coincidence that it was on the first plan because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, there have been no cinema cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there are still complicated racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on a two-and-a-half year test deadline for the road coverage during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which he calls home, simply: “Bardak.”
She still holds the speech she learned when she went out on the Ferguson streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for bite U.S. players
El Salvador footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have been long disqualified for non-sport behavior.
During the quarterfinals of the Golden Cup of the North and Central American football confederations and the Caribbean countries (KONKAF), the Salvadorans bite U.S. players.
The first was the defendant Henry Romero.
The El Salvador man kissed the attacker Josi Altidor, after which he stumbled him for his chest.
Then the semi-defense Seren, when he gave a corner in his penalty square, kissed the U.S. defendant Omar Gonzales.
As a result, Romeo was disqualified for three matches, and Seren for six.
The match ended with the victory of the Americans 2:0, Goal.com reports.
The appearance of similarity: the artist creates portraits with the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the room in the Friedman Gallery in New York, from the roof on the wire, the faces of people - white, black and brown, all something unfathomably similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dwayne-Harborg from the butterflies and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from the prison in Fort Leventworth, where the former intelligence analyst is sentenced to 35 years for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks site.
The new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called "The Resurrection of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dwayne-Harborough, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident, whom Barack Obama calmed the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the computer DNA program obtained from Manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons that could be in people with such a genome, Dwayne-Harborg created a deep, although uncomprehensible manifesto dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data – the different ways of their interpretation and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from the adolescence openly said she believes herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her prison photographs were unavailable, so only one of her photographs was known: a grain black and white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum shade of hairstyles, obviously feeling uncomfortable, sits behind the driver of the car; with this photo she and began to associate.
In 2015, Dwayne-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project "Vision of Strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of court clues such as corns and a glover, removing DNA from this waste and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," Dwayne Hagborg explained at the preliminary show of a new exhibition for the press.
At that time, Chelsea was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she didn’t want to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison mouse became friends on the correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a book of comics, "The Strengthed Images", illustrated by Shaily Canyon, who illustrated how in the future the president will mitigate Chelsea's punishment and she will be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Menning just a few days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven heavy years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong in the fact that the exhibition opens just now that Donald Trump declares war to the people who disclose secret information in the government, and inventes new ways to burn on Twitter the hostility he is called to mitigate.
When Dwayne-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of it all over time, she said, “There’s nothing to happen.”
In the artist’s statement, written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature Manning down (with a heart instead of a point above “i” in her name) calls for the end to “automatic division based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side - its mitochondrial DNA, a long shell from scripts C, G and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotide, as the artist is scientifically exciting), Dwayne-Harborg hoped to show how we are all surprisingly similar, in any case by its biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our gene does not determine what we are, how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is,” said Dwayne-Harborg; her 2007 video work “False Memories” is also displayed here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here.”
The last part of the exhibition, located in one room, is the aforementioned novel in comics.
Manning in King Kong style appears above the U.S. Correction Hall building with a speaker in the hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it is written there.
“So never silence.”
“This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me,” says the artist who welcomed us from Philadelphia.
“I still have mushrooms on my skin when I’m talking about it.”
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally – as it was clearly shown in the comics – but when she comes, she will be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, her own genetic simulators gathered, like a crowd of protesters.
This was also done intentionally, like all on the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning height), on which the pencil was drawn genetic gaps.
“In the past I’d hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people,” says Dwayne-Harborg about the portraits.
“I wanted them to be similar to the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, as a movement that stands for its liberation.”
Professor of the Northwestern University and an employee of the Oxford University are searching for police accusations of murder
According to the police, a national cloud is going to the professor of the Northwestern University and an employee of the Oxford University, who are being searched as suspects in connection with the fact that a luxury room in Chicago has been found a dead dead man.
According to the Cock County Court’s protocols, arrest orders were issued on Monday for a pretexted murder without the right to release under the imprisonment of the fourteen-year-old Windem Lathem and the fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was injured by multiple wounds.
In a warning issued by the police department of Chicago, the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived in the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the site of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from a knife injury, considering it a murder, while the police are strictly searching for two suspects.
Latem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, Vice President of the University of Communications, said in an email statement that Latham is in administrative vacation and that he is prohibited from entering the Northwest University campus.
“Today, this is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and the Northwest University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabaj said.
Warren is a senior employee of the Oxford University’s financial agencies.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement: "We have contacted the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative bodies."
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to give up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Gullelmi said he strongly advised the suspects to give up their bodies.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” Gullelmi said.
According to Gullelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search of suspects.
According to Gullelmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, which just received a mysterious message that something happened at the 1008 number.
Police have called the place of the crime terrible.
Gullelmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.
According to him, data from a video camera confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Lateem and the victim were linked into relationships,” Gullelmi said.
The headquarters of the Grand Plaza issued a call to the guests, in which it was: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and examining a number of motives, including a possible household incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will meet the WADA road map requirements in the near future”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in compliance with the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has been entitled to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Muttko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap on the restoration of the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the renewal of the work of the RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Muttko, it does not contain anything that could make it difficult for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian antidoping structures must publicly recognize the results of the investigation conducted on the order of the WADA of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, in which it claimed that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the state.
Asking this question, Muttko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there was no state program, and we will not recognize what was not.”
Muttko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the same morning, in an interview with the Russian newspaper "Rsport", Smirnov acknowledged the previous problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and positions.
Unconditionally no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA’s chief executive Olivier Nigli said that the RUSADA “move in the right direction” to restore its work.
Fire in the 79-storey tower in Dubai
A large fire that occurred in one of the highest housing buildings in the world, the Torch Tower, has been destroyed, Reuters.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the focuses of the fire at 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow).
Local authorities said no one was injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets near the sky were closed.
The causes of the incident are unknown yet.
Previously, it was that in Dubai, the 79-storey residential sky is burning The Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated in time.
The unimaginable set of the Buzz shock of fans: pants that do not cover truses

Stoltenberg acknowledges deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
This was on Friday, 4 August, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
The Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of the relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary-General also criticized Russia for the situation with the Crimea and "destabilization in the east of Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and the further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said the relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and accused the U.S. Congress of doing so.
The Yekaterinburg Metro has a new method of payment
In October, the pass in the Yekaterinburg metropolitan can be paid by a bank card, said the Director-General of OAO "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "Regional newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce the same payment system for the 2018 World Cup in the metro as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, the guests of the worldwide, to be able to take advantage of the metropolitan with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in the row,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to evaluate the level of satisfaction among the employees of her startup in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often widespread, useless, or worse, unrighteous.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, managing a 75-person company in San Francisco, Madison Reed, e-commerce in hair care.
He asked for help from third parties.
Now there is a new type of staff startups that help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure the involvement of employees, they allow companies to make express queries, contact certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymousness and hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow informers to pass the top management and contact directly to the management.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnet, co-founder and chairman of Glint from Redwood City, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure the involvement of employees.
Errett said she has gained greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over the three years of using Glint.
In addition to express queries and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company’s heat map and shows in a clear form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies gradually realize that they need to control the situation at work, otherwise they will become the next "Uber", who was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post in which he described an aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like “Glint”, the desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the online portal "Let's Talk About Payment", dedicated to financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the background of Uber’s decline in reputation.
Convercent has 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
“Uber” has recently appeared among customers.
Like “Glint”, “Convercent” allows companies to send individually ordered staff opinion surveys, collect confidential real-time answers and view the heat maps of problem zones.
It also provides a hot line for anonymous text messages, which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the management.
“The public opinion court has taken over the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is badly treating employees or behaving unethically, even if the inspector does not interfere, the company may face expensive consequences in the form of customers’ boycott, employees’ deflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
“Ruby Tuesday”, a restaurant network with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used “Convercent” for more than a year to make sure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way to contact the head office of the company.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for the telephone number or email of the head office, submit an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday company’s legal management, who said there was no normal way to track employees’ complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages – can be discovered and dealt with faster.
“I can get closer to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group, said.
“And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings with employees.”
According to Quinland, the companies began to take ethics, values and employee involvement seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Dale Enron.
But only when “social networks got mass spread,” companies realized that they won’t be able to keep their dirty clothes from viral spread on the net.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking regular fees from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has been approved by venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in a total capital of $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising if we take into account the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing scale of research shows that today’s employees expect more jobs than before.
In markets with strong competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they spend their time on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they’re listening to them, and that the work they do brings results, they’re more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, Vice President for Global Benefits and Employee Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both “Convercent” and “Glint” are used.
Investors get income when the company’s portfolio is going well; the company’s business is going well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employees’ loyalty and involvement, it’s not surprising that they find support.
As culture experts say at work, it is important to have data about the involvement of employees.
But the data is useless until the guardians of the company take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can make the impression that changes are going on.
And if the changes don’t happen quickly enough, or don’t happen at all, disappointment can develop, and employees lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you’ll have to be ready to hold 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Rat, Chairman of Management Consultancy at Kotter International, who had to see how companies make a mistake by too much relying on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the employees will think, ‘Do you really hear me?
You do not matter?
And if you don’t care, why should I don’t care?”
According to Errett, the company Madison Reed, which is now conducting monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day when someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after gathering feedback from employees, unhappy with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run this knowledge will help it keep employees more efficiently in a industry known for its high staff flow.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you’ll lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose the company.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is opened on the prospect of the Red Army
In Barnaul, radical measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the failure of the asphalt on the prospectus of the Krasnoarmey.
The place where caves occurred twice on the recently asphalted passing part (crossing with the Street of the Youth), is decided to "open".
The collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways occurred due to the fact that the land was settled in the area of an unhosted unexploited network.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee on road economy, well-being, transport and communications Ivan Garmat, for the detailed investigation and elimination of the predictions to the collapse will be conducted a detailed investigation.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will need to restore the bubble of home-free communications and their concrete.
This is on the official website of the capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has canceled training twice a day.
The time is approaching at 11 pm; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles are delayed to battle on one side of the new training fields of the team located on the campus.
Some of them pulled their shorts, naked their back shining from sweat after the busy first day of the sports camp.
For many of the team players, these minutes of wrath are a break in the middle of the day.
Players registered for the summer classes, after a three-hour training, will go back to the hostels to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Vasserman football center at the meeting at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, team coach Brunei Jim Mora said: "The next three days these guys are waiting for a meat."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden for players, actually extended their working day – at least until the exam ended on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training teams at the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled at 7:15 p.m., so that they will be placed in and without that tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two exercises a day was a greater number of days with one training, and Bruins moves the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and performs training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will be scheduled to take 18 training until August 20, including, before starting official training for the first game in the season against the team of Texas University A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the change of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of him in the tight schedule of players appeared another point.
“In three or four days we’re giving them this huge burden, this is a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they’ve just overcome it, they’re working, they’re wonderful guys.
I think when we live until Saturday and we’ll have more time, it’ll be really good.”
When the camp ends, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is a difficult task as its fields are in direct visibility from the adjacent parking and from the neighboring Laskin Center, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls overcome the defensive network behind the gates.
Players from "Bruins" should take the hotel from this weekend, but Mora assumes that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We’re going to have a guard,” Mora said.
“This is a serious problem, and I don’t exaggerate the danger, assuming that someone can take off the room, sit there, and record the video training.
If you have a video of training, it’s very serious.
But there will be a guard there and there will be a guard on the parking lot number 8.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I will not be too worried about it.
We have a plan.”
The victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg are removed from hospitals.
All the victims of the terrorist attack in the metro of St. Petersburg in April were removed from hospitals.
This was in the press service of the deputy governor Anna Mityanina.
According to data by the end of July, three people remained in the hospitals, TV Center reports.
The explosion in the metropolitan city of St. Petersburg occurred on April 3.
The bomb was exploded by the dead terrorist Akbarzhon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the executor himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including alleged organizer Abror Azimov, have been arrested.
On Wednesday, Rospotrebnadzor recommended the Metropolitan Municipality of St. Petersburg to review the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular by increasing the number of metal search engines.
Facebook Increases Fact Checking in Fighting Fake News
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mysticism to independent experts and show their conclusions under original posts, the world’s largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called fake news, said Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible myths, send them to check and possibly show the fact-check results under the starting post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which, according to many, influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misleading by false messages before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections stated their support for a plan to punish social networks if they will not quickly remove the post burning hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced the testing of the new fact-check algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are contested by independent checks, people want to have a broader context to make reasoned judgments about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, Facebook news band manager, wrote.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "related articles" feature and work on other changes in the news bar to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a comic novel: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, Scotney's small castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a port for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years since his pleasant place in the Valley of the Bull River in Kent County, he observed the stormy story around, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with ground hair and a tendency to historical documents, to a comic novel.
“I think it’s so beautiful to see a man who died 300 years ago,” he says with enthusiasm.
“You feel that personally when you keep this letter in your hand.”
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells about the families that lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Brian May Smith, William Exley, Beckie Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on archive data: in 2014 he wrote “The Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories” – a collection of documents from the British Library; this project suddenly hit him to the depths of his soul.
“I could just get a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 17th century by a double agent who worked on Jacobits,” he tells.
“This is his fingerprint.”
And the letters always smell the smoke, because at those times the fire was burned for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you’re there too.
I love the archives!”
For a person covered by such a passion for old papers, getting the support of the National Foundation and the English Art Council and living in the castle for four months ("Honestly, I've got a little down there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the “new” Victorian castle all the days, walked through archives and looked at numerous treasures of possessions and ancient things – for example, the heads of ginseng on the walls or bottles, centuries spent in ruin.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talked with foresters, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then in the evening, he "dry whisky and sat down to write."
The history of the castle is not much studied because the National Fund received full access to it only in 2006, when the last inheritance, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, the staff just began to deal with the archive, which he describes as "that the aristocrats have fallen down for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who possessed something: “You think the land disputes are boring,” Rods says, “but here for this barge two families were fighting.
So is it, guys!”
In some stories, the castle is becoming the starting point for wider searches in English history: for example, in the "Worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 village revolution.
“There are information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book entitled ‘The Knights of Kent and Sasseks’,” Rods says.
“The peasant rebellion began in these places, and I thought that the rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, for example, the Priest, which tells us about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family had hidden for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the "contrabandist", about the 18th-century contractor Arthur Darrell, who is believed to scan his own funeral, grabbing the tomb with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the tomb was excavated).
Darreli is Rhodes’ favorite family of all who lived in Scotney: “The gentlemen seemed to be a perfect jelly, they always went into debt and spent money on what they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, Darrella men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women – I imagine them as a company of sympathetic guys who know how to take care of the heirs of great wealth.”
After completing his work in the Castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writer experience.
He lived for two weeks in a Finnish glush, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elayamanmiaki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century was a sanatorium, and then it again grown into the forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he said.
“I felt like this: I’ve got to get back to real life again.”
15 Biggest Banks Choose Russia
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkosbank, Binbank and FC Opening, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of the ARB organisations will be at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out – all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions – the Association of regional banks “Russia”, which is headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, by the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and the deputy on the number of prepared bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was placed during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council examined new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the statutory capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that, according to the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by capturing their clientity.
Among other claims sounded the criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of Tossunyan, is not always justified to revoke licenses from some banks, which, in fact, followed an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many managers of the banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were among the management bodies of the ARB.
Obviously, this exchange of inter-excluding opinions in a very sensitive to the relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring disagreement with the policy of the ARB, to begin preparing for membership in the association "Russia", noting that "efficiency of the work of the ARB is at a low level, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is actually not carried out."
Investors will be better.
What will end?
We will answer immediately the main question, which arises with the smallest failure or conflict in the banking sector or near it: investors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
The "Russia" is headed by Anatoly Aksakov, known for his compassion in everything concerning the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all the significant legislative initiatives of the regulator go through the expert assessments of the "regions".
In the staff-organization plan, obviously, special shocks will not be forecast as well.
Without a doubt, the ARB falls into a difficult financial and management situation after the loss of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest – founded in 1991 – organization that defends the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation as a whole.
It is not to say that in the association "Russia" with widespread embraces are ready to accept new members under any circumstances, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may too much want"), who on July 21 at the briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day representatives of the banks out of the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of the banks in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is ongoing, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the association’s extraordinary congress is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
We will determine there.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair does not hold," called the possible new leader of the renewed association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to break the vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council "Russia", where it is intended to consider the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia".
Motor vehicles to major cities in Russia will not be restricted
Deputy Chairman of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asayul said that, contrary to the media reports, the entry of gas engine vehicles into major cities of Russia will not be limited yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the environmental class.
The idea is to move to zero emissions.
I think we are technically not ready for that.
The question is: from which year?
This is the same on the slogan level of the phrase - let's prohibit it.
Where and When?
tomorrow ?
Will the whole city be closed?
“In 20 years – I don’t know, maybe that’s going to happen,” Prime said.
Earlier the newspaper "Izvestia" that by August 17 Vice-President Arkadia Dvorkovich was commissioned to study proposals on possible options of domination of electric transport, presented to the government by the Director-General of the PAO Kamaz Sergey Koggin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of aircraft in large cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump has announced that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, which will change the rules for receiving green cards.
The plan provides for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for receiving temporary work visas and restrictions on receiving family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. gives green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who speak English, have the money resources that allow them to maintain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and it should worry us.
We did not think that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological successes in sex robots was released.
and mda.
Sex robots are at the center of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) has recently published a report dedicated to the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, the merited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the co-founder of FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of the robots, the shape of the socks and the type of nails.
“People are shaking about this, but companies are already sending them in large amounts to consumers, and soon we’ll see them much more,” Sharki said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their swollen cousins to robots with silicone skin, warm to touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "configure" their robots according to their taste by choosing everything from the color of the eyes and shape of the robot's pears to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which the Stepford Woman would seem very progressive, worries even more.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone leather.
For example, the company “RealBotix robot” allows users to adjust in quality robots that they find attractive – for example, shinyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which are delivered with a already programmed individuality – for example, the Cold Farra makes an impressive, and the Wild Wendy has a “due” character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly to yours,” said True Companion.
That’s why she loves what you love, doesn’t like what you don’t like, and so on.
She’s changing mood over the day, like a real man.
She may want to sleep or bite, or she may be “in mood!”
The appearance of sex robots causes a lot of concern – not at last because they replace real human relationships – but the most seriously concerns the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape that causes the domination of the Cold (read: resistant) Faroe.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why do men not have Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a deviation from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optionary supplement.
Most men will, of course, not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the senses of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad and not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s not a coincidence that these complicated sex robots appeared just when women’s rights around the world were threatened, when a president in the White House praised what applies to women.
The worst thing in the TV series "The Story of a Servant" is not graphic images, shrinked bodies and shrinked eyes, and exactly how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galaad is an exaggeration, but it doesn’t seem so big now.
The purpose of the sex robots industry is to such a physical likeness to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars), which technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like people to feel, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it’s exactly their “character” robots don’t look like real women.
They cannot break with their partners or leave them.
They don’t have their own life or biography – nothing that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of complete addiction.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the servants.
The Los Angeles-born Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was in an interview with the portal BeBasket by the general manager of the "blue yellow" Andrei Lebedev.
We tried to deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won’t come for family circumstances.
We’re going to the Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will give opportunities to develop our young players,” he said.
Remember: with the immediate participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team occupied the record sixth place on the Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time hit the World Basketball Championship, in which the "Yellow-Blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the U.S. producer earned an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 selections and gave 5 transfers.
Jeter stopped playing for the Ukrainian team since he left the post of the chief coach of our national team, the American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The European Basketball 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournament matches on the Promised Earth.
Evgenia Murzin will have five matches in group B: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In the framework of the preparation for the tournament, our male team held two control matches, in which the Dutch and the Belarusians passed.
The great success of Trump?
Imaging Mita Romney seems quite reasonable.
In the Trump era, a common place became the fact that political disputes that polarized the U.S. electorate on a micro-level broke some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers sprinkled columns about how to deal with horrible relatives voting for Trump.
It seems that we are all so stressed that we’re going to break soon.
Less talk about Trump’s ability to unite families.
I write about it because my cousin, the left-looking poet from Chicago, who has long been on the knives with the Republicans in her family, came to me to New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against the common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother with whom she has disputed politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on one side.
After dinner, it’s undoubtedly good; but I can’t think that in a wider context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has inspired forces into the left side, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and the “normalization,” we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will cease to be affected by his outlets.
However, there is an even more doubtful scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the rightest Republicans, who in the background of his standards suddenly appear as a sample of good sense.
I’ve taken myself into what I’m very missing today on the old-fashioned madness of Mit Romney – with a dog on the car roof and a 14-percent income tax (but we knew at least how his tax declaration looked) – compared to Trump and that, and the other seems very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will be enough to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park - the largest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are terrible and enormous, the glass fiber images on the central bubble – grace-like clowns and animals, who, turning down, in horror look at their back – are extremely angry, and the sounding music, as strange as it is, leads to excitement.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skies are aging, the silhouettes of the buildings are too coming to cause trembling, and the reality of the city fails to dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I’m still experiencing the day when I learned that the Swiss Cottage area is actually not a Swiss shale (the thematic pub “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” is not in account), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
A carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a eleven-year-old child and two-year-old women can spend great time.
If I could put a carousel rating, I would put a fifth, but, fortunately, no one asked me about it.
And in the universum this week I was asked before going to spend a card on the terminal, to evaluate my "experience" of purchases on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street, the same plus the option to accompany the tea rating of 15 percent is for the order at the stand.
As a result, not only does the idea-neutral interaction slow down, but it is also necessary to introduce a personal attitude into a situation that does not imply it.
The poor seller in the universum shop smiled confusedly while I was tired of evaluating my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison for a second time visit to a doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of cuts on the palms, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of falling in the room.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecutor's appeal to the initial sentence for unintentional murder.
He killed Steencamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting it several times through the door of a toilet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The Prosecutor's Office said it intended to submit another protest, this time against the six-year term for Pretorius, which, according to her, is too soft.
The Prosecutor's Office said it will file an appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be considered this year.
The term of prescription may be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect of killing a NTV journalist has been selected with a signature on the non-exit
Capital law enforcement officials have chosen a suspension measure in the form of a signature for a man who committed an attack on NTV journalist Nikita Rozozjaeva during a direct broadcast from the park Gorky on August 2.
This is by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Irina Volk.
“In the framework of the investigation of the criminal case initiated by article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“Combat”) against a 32-year-old man who hit on the face of a correspondent of one of the television channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named Gorky, the suspect has been selected a measure of interruption in the form of a signature on non-exit and proper behavior,” Volk said.
A representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that the suspect was prepared an administrative protocol for the police's non-accusation.
On Wednesday, August 2, during the direct broadcast to the Day of the VDV to the correspondent approached a non-threatening man and hit his face.
As it was later revealed, Huligan has nothing to do with VDV.
According to Razvozjaev himself, the landslides, on the contrary, tried to arrest the Mosquevic.
Two Bulgarian citizens arrested in Greece for illegal room parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens have been detained in Greece for illegal palace parking.
In the morning of August 1, a group of people who placed the tents in an unplaced place was arrested in Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the BBC that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the control of the free campings and already impose serious penalties to all who have been captured during the parking in a place not intended for this.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses U.S. Vice President of the “Cold War” rhetoric
The statements made during the European tour of U.S. Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is sad to note that Washington is getting deeper to the primitive idealized stamps of the Cold War, which are completely distracted from reality," the Russian Foreign Policy Department said in a statement.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the words of Pence about the "Russian threat" and attempts to violently cross the borders told them in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructivity of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the invisibility of the thesis about the alleged unalternative entrance of all Southeast Europe to NATO.
Also, Russian diplomats reminded that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another focus of tension.
“We call on U.S. colleagues to stop sheltering Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
Feldscher injured in a "short" accident in Moscow
The accident occurred in the sub-Moscow Stupino, as a result of the collision of an alien with the "Speed Assistance" car, the feldscher was injured.
Today around 08:10 a Mitsubishi car crashed with a car of emergency in the city of Stupino of the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the "fast" car turned," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Moscow region.
The police officers are working on the site, the circumstances of the incident are cleared.
In the Odessa region, a woman thrown out her newborn son on the building, turning into a cellophane package.
In the evening of August 3, the police department received a message from a local resident that he found a package with a baby in an unbuilt private house.
“On the place of the incident, law enforcement officers and doctors departed, who quickly delivered the child to the medical facility,” the head of the National Police said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before the detection, which is indicated by the presence of a puppet.
In the course of the first operational and investigative measures, the identity of the mother was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also found that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the headquarters, in the field of view of law enforcement the family previously did not fall and on special account did not take place.
Currently, the police are determining the circumstances and reasons that offered the woman to the case, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The child is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolaev threw her premature baby into a waste pipeline.
Gregory Leps: “I’m going to fight, though 55 is not 30”
One of the most successful artists of the Russian estrad, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer talked to the viewers of "Investigation".
I remember how your “poltain” was marked.
Special cottage in the "Luzhnika", Gloria Gaynor singed for the nominee, a powerful salut over the Moscow River.
You’d probably wondered how you’d like to spend your next five years.
The intentions fulfilled?
When it comes to the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, three times travelled with tourists throughout the country, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I am no longer the one, I say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock should not be deceived.
Singing as I sing in my 30s becomes more and more difficult.
I’m going to fight, I don’t want to stop.
And I think I’m going to a different level with new people.
With them you and the new album record, the first in three years.
The work on him is going on now.
In fact, we’ve already recorded it all in my studio and now we’re sending it to Los Angeles.
He’s called “Why are you so serious?” by the same name song that was written together with Timati.
It’s not ready yet, so we haven’t put it anywhere.
We will do this later when we take a clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts at the Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new plate was attached to the hand by the classical American drummer Chris Colman.
Do you think you wanted to attract him into your tourist composition?
In my opinion, Colman is one of the most outstanding bubbles in the world today.
He came to me to the studio, recording his parties.
I suggested him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a famous bubble player participating in various projects) suggested.
But for prolonged work in Russia they set out, mildly speaking, excessive conditions.
It was about honors from €35 thousand to €45 thousand a month.
Then I thought I would also find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great bubble Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed their own.
Sometimes I want to get to one of them, not for what.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
It is written by Western music magazines and invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with a different performing technique, came."
Your album is released in Los Angeles, American musicians collaborate with you, but you can’t come to the United States yet?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Right now, I do nothing.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I really regret that I can’t get to America.
I have repeatedly said that I will learn there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We’re not stupid of them, but we don’t have such experience, school.
For our performers of popular music for 70 years, the tasks that American musicians have always solved have not been placed at all.
They strive for the highest quality sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for a reason, the UK has refused me to enter for ten years.
But I will still submit visas to the British Embassy every year, so that I will be allowed to go there again and, most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is beneficial to me.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not an order, but an offshore, right?
Yes, there’s a good sporting hall in Monte Carlo, I’ve been there once.
Now they have been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert are already sold.
The Lime Waikule Rande, which will start on July 20 in Yurmal, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, replied.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who knows how to give herself both a beautiful vocal and even a scream.
After excursions and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to refer to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
Two albums with his songs you already have in the discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done completely differently.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky about in the same file as he did himself.
The voice and the guitar.
No other arrangements.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I try to attract to the album and Alexander Jakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked about this topic with him, we have good relationships, but he’s a busy person, so let’s see how it’s going to happen.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenchikov gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Maybe you’ll write the album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked: Can I sing one or another of his songs?
He replied, “Grigory, I write songs so that they can be performed.”
Please try and sing.
I think it’s interesting to record this album.
So far I don’t have such a task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn’t object, I’ll probably do such a project.
If you are not fully focused on the affairs of your production center.
I guess, until you have yet realised his potential, have not signed contracts with all the artists that you are interested in?
There are a number of performers I would dream of having under my wing, but they are independent, composed people.
Do you understand Sergei Lazarev?
Sereza is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with something with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center is now Alexander Panayotov, whom I’ve led in “Voice”.
We have a contract with him and work.
In our pop music such singers are rare.
It will be sincere regret if it does not reach the heights it deserves.
I try to get him a repertoire and take a clip.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: I buy songs to them, I cry to poets, sometimes their tricks fall into the rotating of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit they will receive a recorded album, a few videos.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be happy if any of them gets a commercial success and pay me the interests that we have agreed in the contract.
But if that doesn’t happen, I’m not going to block oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, break, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to make a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entrance to the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
This is mainly about closed activities.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, who, in my own belief, was flying to Syria on the same plane that later collapsed.
If tomorrow they say we need to fly to another point in the interests of the state, I will go.
And I’m crazy what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has happened to us with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and we must be together.
I’m sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And before I did for a year in Ukraine for 40-50 concerts.
They met like nonewhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists he collaborated: Annie Lorak, St. Loboda, Artem Loyk...
In Ukraine a mass of gifted people, and it is sincere regret that now they can’t fully spread their talent to the broad Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would have a pleasure to invite some of the classical Ukrainian performers to Russia, for example, Slav Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I think it is unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Ohlopkov moved from the cosmodrome
As it became known "Ъ", the technical director of the cosmodrome East Andrei Ohlopkov began to work in the State Space Scientific and Production Center (GKNPC) named Hrunichev.
Earlier he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Eastern cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the exploitation of land and space infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in the Moscow Filies, where he will be engaged in the coordination of production.
The replacement of Mr. Ohlopkov will not be: the post of the technical director is likely to be cancelled, and the function will be dissolved by the CENKI units.
About the fact that the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director-General of the CENKI on Technological Development Andrei Ohlopkov moved to work in the GKNPC named Khrunichev, "Ъ" told the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government's apparatus.
“He has been working on a new post for a few weeks,” the industry’s “Ъ” interlocutors said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment by CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was unavailable for comments.
However, the information "Ъ" was officially confirmed in the GKNPC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, - said at the enterprise. - Andrei Ohlopkov made the task placed before him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the cosmodrome Eastern fully fulfilled.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work at the CENKI in 2013, having a service behind his shoulders in the space troops, in particular at Baykonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome occupied the post of the first vice commander in the title of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ohlopkov became a figure of the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of taking into account: allegedly from his submission the regional traders were receiving state orders, but did not fulfill the commitments taken to clean up the separated parts of the missile carriers in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the court declared him innocent.
The duties imposed on him in the CENKI on technological development spread to different projects, but the main of them was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
The head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, said in an interview that the situation in the East was “critical in October 2013.”
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made during the planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 missile was planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To make the launch until the end of the year, the construction was decided to be completed six months earlier and the deadlines were shifted from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it was necessary to go to the trick: CENKI specialists began conducting parallel installation of technological equipment on unbuilt facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Ohlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and yet the transfer occurred (instead of December 2015 the "Soyuz" fled only April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "Ъ" on the cosmodrome: "Otherwise we't have done a single launch from the East until now, but would have done construction."
Vice Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, curating the creation of the cosmodrome, laughed and called Andrey Ohlopkov his "spatial Susanin", but he almost always asked for information about the course of construction.
Mr. Ohlopkov remembered and straight: for example, in an interview with "Ъ" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) of the status of the only executive in the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Specstroy?"
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has taken over the duties of the general contractor to complete the construction and assembly work on the start and technical complex to the planned in the fourth quarter.
According to the "Ъ", the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov's move to a new place of work became disagreements with the CENKI's leadership regarding the methods of completion of the construction of the structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of work with subcontractual organizations.
"It was decided that this will be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the building of the East.
The employee of the government’s apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best specialists, finding him an equivalent replacement will be difficult.”
According to "Ъ", this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be dissolved by the CENKI units.
Music Schools will have two specialties training programs.
In the future, children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, Svetoslav Golubenko, for this, students can recall repeated disciplines, and the issue with the payment of the remaining classes in the second specialty to resolve with the help of special grants, reports RIA Novosti.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue into control, and we together with the expert community will develop a mechanism that will allow to acquire two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education,” Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during the “Nedet’s conversation” of Vladimir Putin with the educators of the Syrius Children’s Center, the student Maria Andreeva that she was forced to pay repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told her that she learns in the class of violin and piano and has awards of competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized the issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russians arrested on a wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man, Cyril N., was arrested, who on the wall fell on the roof of a high building, reports the El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, passed through a three-meter shelter to the territory of the Nestle office building complex and took himself on one of his shelters.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and chains.
The young man was arrested on the roof.
The staff of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They will find out if the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man climbing to the height has become popular on the Internet.
Users called the boy a “spider.”
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help relieve the inflammation.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies say the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory intestinal diseases.
This unhealing disease, which suffers about 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colics and abdominal swelling, chronic or blood sweat, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to relieve symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy, but researchers from the Washington University have found that the main amino acid triptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colona, explained that the intestinal immune cells monitor that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory diseases of the intestine.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacteria in the intestine have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan – one of the building elements of the protein – to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colona said: "We have established a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of a normal intestinal microbiome, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophan was contained in the mouse diet, the more these immune cells they had.
He suggested that the same will work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a triptophan-rich diet can contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying the variety of increasing tolerance immune cells, found that one group of suspected mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line but contained separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the intestinal microbioms of mice – the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mouse intestinal cells was sequentiated, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but absent in mice without them.
Mouse grown in a sterile environment, having no good microbioma and not developed this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and immune cells in them appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grown L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of liquid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
The immune cells are converted into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a side product of triptophan processing, known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of triptophan in the mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of triptophan was doubled, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same increasing cell tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is unknown whether the L. reuteri triptophan side-products contribute to the development of cells in humans as well as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory intestinal diseases, defects in triptophan-related genes have been detected.
She says, “Maybe the development of these cells we need to strengthen, as the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
The high levels of triptophan with the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to the expansion of their population.”
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United has hired “genius” in the face of Nemania Matic.
"Manchester United" hired "genius" in the face of Nemania Matic, says Jose Mourinho after the semi-defense debuted in the match against "Sampdoria" on Wednesday evening.
The player, earned for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of the United before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a half-defense, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Perry broke forward when they are grateful.
However, as Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparations for the game, and he stood only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires improvements before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in how he thinks, he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him prepare earlier than later.”
Just like Matic, his colleagues-new players Victor Lindelef and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviv Stadium when Mourinho began to form his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club has already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
“I’m going to be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot for me.”
Former leaders of the Social Democrats of Lithuania agree to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkiewiczus and Gediminas Kirkylas, as well as former Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Czechoslovakia Yurshenas, appealed to the one-party parties with a call to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the "Parliamentary Gazette", due to the trembling with the partners - the Union of peasants and "greens" - in the Social-Democratic Party initiated a discussion whether it should remain in the ruling coalition.
And here, three senior experienced comrades addressed the one-party with an open letter, in which, in particular, it is said: "A clear disappointment of the party's comrades with the results of the elections, however, the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us let's not very easy, but still the conditions for the further implementation of the social justice goals, which on our initiative are provided in the program of the government, and for the preservation of the political domination of the left center over the right parties."
According to the former party leaders, in the discussion so far "the emotional expression of opinion without concrete arguments has been recovered."
The authors of the letter are afraid that unthinkable actions of their party could lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
Disabled Anton Mamayev sentenced to punishment
The court has mitigated the punishment of the disabled cyclist Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier by the judgment of the Timirazev court, the convicted was released from the SIZO.
At the same time, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused is a criminal because he organized the robbery and the kidnapping of the motor rollers from the former fighter of the special forces.
The Court of Appeal by its decision relieved the punishment of Anton Mamayev to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the breakdown, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person must be brought to criminal liability,” said Uljana Solopova, the spokesman for the Mosgorsud.
In this case, the court had taken into account the state of Mamaev’s health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of disturbing circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which the penalty can be appointed below the lowest limit.
As for the assistant of Mamayev Vasily Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for the change of the category of severity of the judgment and the change of the judgment.
Anton Mamaev himself said he was dissatisfied with the decision of Mosgorsud.
I am disappointed by the judgment.
The only legitimate decision would be the justification, the intention to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not exclude the appeal of the sentence in the cassation instance of Mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the roofs up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
Remember, 28-year-old Moskovic Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a figure of a criminal case in the autumn of last year.
The disabled claims that he bought a motoroller from acquaintances for 160 thousand rubles, to then sell.
However, the owners of the motor rollers, among which the former fighter of the special forces, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Serostanov took their property, threatening to apply violence.
On 30 June, the Timirazev district court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serostanov to three years of colony, and Anton Mamaeva to four and a half years of imprisonment with punishment in the colony of the general regime (according to section 2 of article 162 of the Criminal Code).
After the displaced disabled was placed in the SIZO, the case was joined by the Public Chamber, the General Prosecutor's Office, authorized for human rights by President Tatiana Moskalkov.
As a result, in the middle of July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIZO by the decision of the same Timirazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
The UNF will prepare an environmental report to the president
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (UNF) in 2017 will be devoted to the environmental problem, a source in the UNF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of execution of the movement Aleksei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the “front” plans to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Interviews at the UNF note that the report to the head of state will contain a "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the report, the final UNF Forum will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its event is not yet determined – it is normally adjusted to the schedule of the President, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally presents the key events of the UNF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been expressed and will be expressed on these events, we will also form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems, the spokesman at the UNF told Izvestiam.
Co-Chairman of the Central Headquarters of the Movement Olga Timofeeva, head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “front” will report to the head of the state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
In a year, we have grown up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, seen breaks in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will come into the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front" is also about the work on the priority projects of the UNF, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeeva.
She said the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
He has already participated in the work of the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
Within a few months, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues don’t fall out of the agenda, Olga Timofeeva added.
Head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI) Andrei Koladin noted: raising the environmental problem, the UNF acts in the row of the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts proposed at various forums, and these initiatives were supported by the president, Andrei Koladin told Izvestii.
He emphasized that the economic potential of the ecological agenda cannot be excluded to date, which can give the regions an additional impulse for development.
In the future, with the help of the UNF, the regions will be able to promote not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecoturism, the expert added.
The actuality of the environmental theme demonstrated a "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the waste waste in Balashye (already closed) and the coal dust in the port of the city of Nakhka (already developed a bill on the prohibition of the open coal transfer in the settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia in general is created, the question consists in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the positions of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, says the head of the charitable foundation “Ecology for All” Leonid Bochin.
A member of the SPC, the head of the non-governmental organization "Grinpis of Russia" Sergey Ciplenkov in a conversation with "Izvestias" emphasized that to successfully solve environmental problems, a responsible approach of society and business is needed, only a few legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to break the tendency that the breach of environmental legislation is a economically profitable solution for.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car by hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be installed a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even drive the car with a simple hand wrap.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has lived a small chip between big and indicative fingers and now through his company BioTek offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives by the cost of technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal University of Winchester, to ensure that the healing procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is infected by cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northema also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible for a price of £300 per single lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his car “BMW Z4”, which starts when his hand is on the drive.
Revisit for the White House cost the taxpayers a thousand dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided to Time, the White House's decision last month to bring a marine infantry helicopter to the South Loyal for an event dedicated to U.S. industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president is on board, became the central element of the event held on July 17 in the White House, on which the U.S. construction programs were demonstrated.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials have reviewed technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exposed next to a Yacht from Man, a Wisconsin fire car and a carrier from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squad of Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for controlling the helicopter, the Military Administration of the White House ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Loyal in the event of a "unusual" event.
“I just wanted you to make sure you’re aware because it’s an unusual broad news event,” HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his chief, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Navy Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter will arrive on the South Loyal at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in the event intended for 3 hours of the day, and will remain there before the garden will be released between 6 and 9 a.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the guard staff remained next to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by Time magazine, it remains unclear whether the second crew was eventually required.
The Hutch law prohibits federal officials from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event is not contrary to this ruling.
“In addition, we asked if it was not a violation of the Hatch law, and we were answered that no,” the commander wrote.
“It seems that you have no place to do,” the Deputy Chairman replied.
The "Made in America" event was declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hutch law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote the health reform that was at the time in development in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government decrees.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is unlikely a new phenomenon.
The presidents are ordered to use them for travel.
But asking them only for the interests of photography is unusual.
Trump has already become the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential aircraft went on the backdrop during his first pre-election demonstration in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was overwhelmed by messages with complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
“The White House is excited about the ‘Made in America’ show, which showed products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.
The HMX-1 crews frequently carry out training flights around the Washington agglomeration and the South Lake to train the U.S. President's transportation to the White House with accuracy up to a inch.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the event "Made in America" was counted to the crew as the necessary training flights for a month.
The unit’s helicopters on that day also flew 11 additional hours as part of “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, taxpayers did not cost any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company did not participate in the organization of a helicopter demonstration in the South Loyal.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Ministry of Defense’s compensation rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
In the records of the unit is recorded that the aircraft was 30 minutes in each side of its airport based on the air base of the Quantico Navy in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the cost for taxpayers based on the example rate of compensation is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These example rates include personal composition, service and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual assignments.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by REND, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of the individual, but actually take into account the cost of fuel, service and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer spoke about defending the use of a helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things that have been done in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been constantly working on.
Therefore, of course, it is quite appropriate to pay this attention.”
It was unclear whether Trump was interacting with a helicopter, inspecting the South Stream during the event, but he was exactly sitting on the driver's place in a fire car.
Within the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky’s representatives, kissing with the press on the topic of his own fleet of the company’s products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I have three of them.”
Moscow to grant grants to rehabilitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, the "Save Life" grants will be allocated to the rehabilitation and intensive therapy departments of the capital medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named Yudina.
During the clinic examination, he delivered a gratitude letter to the doctor-traumatologist-ortopedist Viktor Prozko, under the leadership of which the most complex operation for the reconstruction of the foot of the teenage was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also told about the decision to annually grant grants to rehabilitation and intensive therapy departments of urban clinics.
The funds will be aimed at encouraging doctors and nurses.
According to the capital mayor, the clinical hospital named Yudina is currently one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, a new modern equipment has entered the clinic, allowing the doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the base of the Colomenan rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are intended to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the rehabilitation and the hospital there are daily departments here.
The staff of the hospital is 2800 people.
The total area, occupying the medical clinic, is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical facility became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term stages (SCP).
They are designed to perform relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the rehabilitation times of patients.
After the operation in the hospital they spend only a few hours.
Only in the first half of this year, 36 thousand patients were hospitalized in the clinical hospital of Yudina.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations of a different degree of complexity.
NBU the absence of Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank buyers
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This was on Friday, August 4, by TASS with reference to a representative of the press service of the NBU.
NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni for the agreement of the indirect (through the Parity Bank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors on the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU did not come," the statement said.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenia withdrew the application for the purchase of the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Guceryev and Grigory Guselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified his decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification on the subject of their compliance with the requirements of the law of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, the son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
The sanctions against the "daughter" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which Sberbank was found, were introduced in the middle of March.
Over the course of a year, they are prohibited to withdraw capital from the country in favour of maternal organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the United Nations said.
The elections can be representative only when all members of the society, including women, participate, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN mission for supporting Afghanistan, hundreds of women are voting for provincial councils, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative only when women are fully involved in them and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban movement threatens to break the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisors.
In this year’s elections, the power for the first time passes peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Heiss said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, from a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

The Prosecutor's Office of Russia has approved the accusation in a criminal case against the former governor of the Kirov region Nikita Belyh, accused of receiving a large capture.
This was on Thursday, August 3, in the department, reports RIA Novosti.
The materials are transferred to the Presnensky district court of Moscow for consideration on the substance.
In Venice, sanctions are strengthened for tourists for unsuitable behavior
The Venetian authorities have strengthened the fines for swimming in channels from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a bathroom or with a naked tour, you will now be punished by 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who will organize a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle across pedestrian areas, TASS reports with reference to the Association of tour operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for the inscriptions on the monuments of 400 euros and for the waste of 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of the special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social networks, as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, on the billboards and in the places of the greatest crowd of tourists.
The campaign will be held in 10 languages.
According to the Venetian tourism adviser, Paola Mar, the information about the penalties will be transferred to the embassy of the homeland of the violators in order to thus warn their co-patrioters of such errors.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the Italian city administration plans to restrict tourism.
In Venice, the number of tourists visiting the city centre has been reduced.
Instead of 100,000 people who wanted to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend the event.
Moreover, a moratorium was introduced to create new fast food hotels and restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
The State Border Service staff in the first half of 2017 detained 272 illegal migrants on the border with the EU countries; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was in the Ministry of Agriculture.
Of them, 314 people were arrested for illegal crossing the border, and the rest - for violating the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other criminal offences.
The largest number - 717 illegal migrants were detained on the border with Moldova.
At the border with the EU countries, 272 illegal people were detained, most of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania.
According to statistics, among the detained illegal migrants are mainly citizens of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India and Armenia.
Moreover, 2,000 potential illegal migrants have not been missed into Ukraine.
The EU has found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.
Jazz in "Skolkovo": experiment and improvisation
The program of the second Skolkovo Jazz Science festival, which will take place on August 26 in the Innovation Center "Skolkovo", has been announced.
Guests are waiting for performances of leading jazz collectives and solists, scientific discussions, interactive platforms and other musical and intellectual events.
As the organizers promise, the site will be an improvisation area and a field to demonstrate new creative opportunities.
“Festival guests will be able to immerse themselves in the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovation in science becomes a new tool of interaction with art,” said Elena Zelencova, vice president of Skolkovo Foundation.
Among the participants of Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 many stars, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra of Igor Butman, who will present a joint program with vocalist Yaroslav Simonov.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and not accidentally they united, the popular artist "Izvestii" explained.
The experiment and improvisation of the jazzmen are valued as high as the scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the performance of Azekel, a British of Nigerian origin, known for both his own work and joint work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.

S.F. has released Ozerov from the position of Chairman of the Committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee Viktor Ozerov and released him from this post.
He remains a Senator from the Khabarovsky Region.
A statement with a request to release him from the occupied position was written last week.
He explained his decision with the need for rotation and his desire to “change the rhythm of life.”
The Senator also noted that the decision to take care was not momentary.
Viktor Ozerov has since 1996 presented the Legislative Assembly of the Khabarov Region in the RF.
The Committee on Defence and Security has been headed by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and goods producers
The past decade of efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to be fruitful.
From 1 September, low voltage electricity costs will be reduced by 25% for industrial recipients.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "About amendments to the Rules of the wholesale market of electricity and power and to the summary forecast balance of production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of the Russian Federation by subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for the Buryatic commodity producers decreases by a quarter, which will significantly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have hunted the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in foolish attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, which runs out of Baikal, the main water collection territory for which Buryatia is.
And only this year began the movements.
In March, tariffs on electricity for the population of the Republic decreased from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of the bullshit on the decision of the federal government in the List of areas of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the characteristics of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the number of industrial consumers has come.
According to analysts, this is just the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt/hour of 1,01 rubles.
But no one dares to call at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements in the direction of the decline for the Storm.
Scooter not scared the Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and arrived in Crimea
Legend of electronic dance music, the group Scooter arrived in Crimea, not afraid of threats from the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine.
“The flight went well, and tomorrow I’m going to have a concert,” said Eich P. Bakster, frontman of the band.

The Scooter show at the Balaklav Festival, which is called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is held by the company "Golden Balk" in honor of the International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of the most famous groups in Germany, was founded in 1993.
The last album of Ace was released in 2016.
In addition to the Scooter, the guests of the festival will be Sergey Galanin and his group "Serga", as well as Gary Sukachev with "Brigada C".

The National Unqualified, Municipal and Domestic Workers’ Union (GMB) is concerned about the investment in McVitie’s factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the McVitie’s cookie manufacturer’s managers in connection with its long-term manufacturing commitment at a Glasgow factory.
The Scottish department of GMB reports that the company silently overlooked the question of future investments in the Tolcrose facility.
The factory, producing, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that it has invested more than £5 million in the building over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “know about them first.”
In a letter to the company’s head, the Scottish GMB department requested McVitie’s response to concerns that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Daffy said: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we can’t get clear from the head of the facility on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolkross.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in the local community and in the territory of the Great Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and on the background of Brexit, the growth of survival minimum and the chronic decline in production, East & Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at McVitie's factory.
Pladis’ representative said, “The head of the Tolkras facility only received a letter from the Scottish GMB department yesterday, and the company will reply immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and trade union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcrose, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to our employees that like all companies working in the conditions of the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all of our facilities and operations – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in case of any changes in the work on this facility, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know about it.”
Putin says the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should join the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Chemical Company, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to contribute to the resolution of the conflicts.
The head of state noted that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier the head of "Rosneft" Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far East Federal District told that the lack of agreement with "Gazprom" on gas for the NCHC threatens the implementation period of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is ongoing.
“Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we don’t have such resources,” Sechin added.
Rosneft has requested permission to use for the “Eastern Petroleum Chemical Company” gas from the Gazprom Kirin field, located on the Sahalin shelf.
In June, Gazprom said negotiations on the issue are ongoing, and “there are no sharp corners.”
Did the PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar’s transition three years ago?
The La Liga player may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not cease to pursue Neymar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of setting a world record in the three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to beat the world record in the cost of the transfer, more than twice exceeding the previous score associated with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition ends, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than £500,000 a week net.
It is known that Barcelona is angry about how the proposal was expressed and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transfer from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world not warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of the PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaze Matthewidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club who would want to overcome one of the best players of the PSG.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they hit one of our players, then we’ll stand against them, we’ll make offers to their players,” Al-Helaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to beat one of our players, the consequences are waiting for them.”
It seems that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the semi-defense player of the PSG Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that it will not release an Italian player under any conditions, and now, probably, Barcelona feels the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin has ordered to deal with the payments to the victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered to resolve the material aid that is allocated to the residents affected by forest fires and to the construction of a new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
In addition, I ask you to report how the case is with payments, compensations to the victims.
I have some differences.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask questions to the relevant colleagues about how much money is allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the authorized representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergei Menialo and the head of the Baikal branch of the FGBU "Glavribvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on the lake cleaning.
Then they showed the boys in an open container next to the container, which they were prepared for breeding.
In the beginning, Putin released a few boys out of the bag.
Then he pulled for a special stick on the container cover and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader commissioned to deal with the environmental situation in Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one volume is needed and a supposedly different volume is provided.
“I want to understand with this, what, in fact, is happening with our financing,” the Russian leader said.
Remember, during the forest fires of 2017, the towns of Buryatia, Irkutsk region were covered by fire, residential houses and economic buildings were destroyed.
