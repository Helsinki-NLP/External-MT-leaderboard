Parliament did not support the amendment freeing Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the article in the new criminal code that convicted opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly entering into a disadvantageous gas purchase agreement with Russia.
The verdict is not final, the appeal of the convicted is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict a political revenge of the regime, and suspicion of bias has been raised in the West.
The motion to remove Section 365 from the penal code, which led to the conviction of the former prime minister, was supported by 147 MPs.
It needed 226 votes to pass.
The Libyan Victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert, and without him, the war is over.
It remains to define the winners.
As is the custom in the region, Islamists win the election, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has signed up to Sharia customary law and we have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because stealing is punishable by death.
Women can forget about emancipation, apostates can be executed and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly do not want.
But our way of life is neither the best nor the best, and it probably wouldn't suit the Libyans for a change.
Actually, it's strange that Islamic fighters took credit for the help of unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse they have is that, in their view, the NATO air strikes were not directed by some American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every successful strike.
So when it comes to Libya, the West is not one of the winners.
We've been in the crossfire, we've served Islam, and our politicians have gotten rid of a political ally in the form of a dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
This eliminates the problem of local Crusaders being driven out.
But without the occupation, will the oil companies have a slice of Libyan black gold?
They may not, and the West will finally be able to boast of its selfless defense of human rights.
Unless we're being stopped by those Sharia law followers.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have become the investors' target
The statistical shrinkage swept across Europe on Tuesday.
The individual countries have published GDP figures for Q3.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-quarter, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and a number of other European countries have published preliminary forecasts for economic developments in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0,5%, France's by 0,4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany performed better than expected (up 0.3% from the original 0.1%), while France reported a slight decline of 0.1% (initial data suggested stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year on year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated on a quarterly basis, confirming the trend of gradual slowdown in the growth of the economy's performance.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year on year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarter on quarter.
The German economy grew by 0,5% in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data.
The euro area and European Union economies grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent year on year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields on Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are starting to feel the problems.
The yields on Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
Germany has voiced the view that the ECB should be the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and are celebrating a 200 million advance
The football team has completed the toughest challenge of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jiráček, she won 1:0.
Czech football, with a lot of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from home revenge and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the game in detail.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the home loss in the final, the great Czech and hero Jiráček, won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the promotion to the European Championship.
The Blackhawks got under pressure in the second half because of the precise defense of the Czech team.
The losers of the match were Damjanovich and Vučinić, who burned two big chances.
Even thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize money for the domestic football will be about 200 million crowns.
There was a lot of fighting football from the first few minutes.
Both teams were hard to get involved in the combination and the game was mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of the home players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense precisely repelled the long kicks for the defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a human shield.
Several hundred college students have formed a human shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
The gesture is intended to show support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed outside the facility at noon Tuesday and then chanted death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, formed a human shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, which processes uranium, on Tuesday.
They are showing that they are prepared to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in a report that Iran does not appear to have stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
There's talk in Israel of a possible attack on an Iranian nuclear facility.
Students prayed before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility at noon and then chanted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press says that the Natanz uranium enrichment facility would be targeted in addition to the Isfahan facility.
Diet of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner of meatballs
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent being obese.
Obese children often come from unhealthy families, according to a recent survey.
Once again, the environment and patterns surrounding a child are vital to healthy human development.
For example, the incidence of bedbugs in obese children is up to half that in families with normal-weight children.
Fried fries were eaten for dinner the day before a research study linked to an awareness campaign called Obesity is no coincidence over 19 percent of obese people.
Also, while most families of today's schoolchildren do not have a habit of exercising in families of obese children, only 15 percent of the children said that their parents make time for physical activity at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 primary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the Obesity is Not a Chance event, sponsored by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from grades 4 to 8 have been involved in the project.
A healthy diet and sufficient physical activity in the family are among the determining factors behind the dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five meals a day on the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner diet, which is a basic requirement for proper nutrition", says one survey.
No breakfast and no dinner
Experts point out that even the relative details, such as regular family breakfast times, are essential for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of school families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding that 10 percent of the households didn't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the foundation of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families with obese children had a much higher incidence of eating unhealthy fries.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary sodas every day (70 percent).
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly participate in sports, their parents did less than half that - 15 percent.
Make up your own menu
The second part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own menus according to their own tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition".
Their favorite foods include many flour, meat, and sweet foods.
"The particular concern is the high popularity of sugary lemonades", says the final report of the survey.
For lunch, pasta was the main course, just ahead of chicken.
But the kids didn't want any legumes at all, and the fish and lunch vegetable food is low.
Health-related
The study also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if given the right information.
"It is no coincidence that a control group of survey participants who completed a questionnaire after the Obesity Education Lecture showed a significant shift in preferences towards healthy eating in a number of cases", the project results state.
The most striking example was in the case of lemonade, where more children would start to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to check poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and to limit sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In my opening article on how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was too much in the introductory class.
I had no idea what was coming.
Three lectures from industry professionals, dressing up problematic characters, and a seminar on how to do it on set.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "trampled".
This time, Principal Alenka and I were discussing (there is not a single boy in the class) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And that's the vast majority.
Some have short necks, some have a boyish figure with no curves, and some are overweight.
A stylist must know how to optically soften broad shoulders, lengthen the neck, or provide the necessary curves.
We were given tips like Jennifer Lopez, like bigger breasts and hips and a smaller waist, to make the figure look nice and not to dress too provocatively.
For example, if the waistline and hips are so far apart that the skirts or pants really don't fit, then it pays to have at least one such piece tailored.
You will not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You'll feel much better in a tailored skirt than one that keeps sliding, folding, reclining around your waist and so on.
A boy figure, on the other hand, can afford to wear clothes with lashes, applications, embroidery or picking.
There's a lot of information and character types, of course, so I'm glad I have a whole week to sort through all the information in my head.
And I'm afraid, given the homework, it's a little too much.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to design two outfits for her: a daytime and an evening outfit.
We must take into account the current appearance, fashion style, and personality type of the person.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit of cheering, for me personally, it's definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has put on a hundred pounds recently (please consider the excess weight), or a young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print them and then process them.
Moodboard, as the whole thing is called, then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is important.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, such as handbag trends, coats, etc.).
This is what Mario Kameník, a stylist and designer, told us.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, packed with information about character types, was quickly colored by three industry guests.
Stylist Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a good stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is key here.
For example, a trenchcoat (or, if you prefer, a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on your bare body, in boots and in photographs as a dress.
Or you can just roll up your sleeves or your collar and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it", he insisted.
But I especially appreciated the advice: "To get a job, you need to know the rules perfectly".
"Then you may begin to violate them", said James.
So I finally understand why we're crushing all these instructions on what to combine with, what to do with, why, when even in fashion magazines we often see something different.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to my photographer, Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more clothing options than they can photograph.
So for a fashion story that's going to be ten pages long, I have to be prepared to "design" at least fifteen.
And also that in a photo, the clothes look and function differently than they do in reality.
So that's what we have to take into account when designing the outfit.
That image and style are often half the success, Honza the Humble confirmed.
You just have to look at Madonna, who is not exactly a singing miracle, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, access to stylists is still rather cold.
Even familiar faces often consider it useless (I can do something, but my appearance is secondary).
And if someone is letting us design their style, then we have to expect that they're going to dictate a very different size to us than they actually are.
Then you just have to Google and see if the tabloid has written about the celebrity getting fat/weakened and so on.
Honza and Mario taught us on Sunday that a stylist doesn't just have to know how to dress and fold.
He's primarily engaged in his work with the people he dresses, so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to be biased, to stand by your opinion.
"If a manager asks you to sort her closet and add nice pieces to it, you can't throw her the whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'"
"Find at least a few things to recommend and wear", says Mario.
He also gave us specific instructions on what the "sack" or bag of food should contain.
It's the one you put around your waist and you have all the properties.
In addition to light items such as scissors, hair clippers, or zippers, there is also silk thread (used by stylists to help photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips to tighten the back of clothing if it is larger (a pin or other clamp is not allowed, it would ruin the garment), or a seam.
To not only listen but also to experience something practical, we learned how to properly fasten our shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio with a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, especially outdoors.
So we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, or they'll get damaged.
So it takes real skill.
Mario was pleased to hear my creation unreservedly praised.
Because that skill isn't really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It's becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling on a professional level is really not a walk in the park, no matter what anyone says.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you race across America.
The review
A carefree drive turns into a routine morning shift ride because of a series of completely unnecessary careless mistakes.
While the ambition has been largely fulfilled, it is worthless if no one has shown any willingness to do anything extra.
The new volume, subtitled The Run, was highly anticipated before its release.
It promised to take the annual Need for Speed racing series in a new direction once again, and from the gameplay samples, it seemed like a game that might not be limited to the action racing genre.
We also wondered what would happen to the embedded passages where the protagonist gets out of the car and runs on his own.
But as is the case with the NFS series, a lot of the results are a little different than we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing pulls down a few unnecessary bugs that have been popping up in the series for a few years now, more or less.
So it's not really a bug, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story in which the protagonist, Jack, has certain personal character problems and as a solution, he is offered participation in an illegal race across America.
You're gonna get behind the wheel of a car on the west coast in San Francisco and your job is to get to New York first.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The circuit is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
This means that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't get the feeling for a second that the game's always the same.
Some of the environments are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of graphics matches previous installments in the series.
So it's not a big deal.
But driving through deserts, autumn landscapes, or high in snow-capped mountains is visually very pleasing.
And the races are occasionally colored by some unusual element.
For example, in the desert, you get caught in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be swept away by an avalanche.
Besides, the individual races are pretty well lined up.
There's only a few types, but that's enough.
You try to outrun the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up with time (a classic stop-gap fight), and then you're faced with a duel with a single opponent.
And the police will intervene from time to time, making your efforts even more troublesome.
The new thing is the exits.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right times.
It's not that complicated.
Surprisingly, there are far fewer of these passages in play than you would expect (in fact, perhaps only three).
But in the end, it's to the advantage of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above, it's one of the elements that make the game more colorful.
The riding model follows in the footsteps of the previous installments.
That means it's definitely not a no-no nowadays, but you can't say it's a no.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But for the more action-packed racing, the driving model here still suits pretty well, even though we could have found a better one at the competition.
So far, all is well.
But problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the passenger model, the crash model is not in good shape.
We don't expect this kind of game to calculate complex deformation and collisions, but when you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before you hit any object, then maybe everything is not quite right.
Typically, in a close pass or passing car in normal traffic, sometimes you just lick each other slightly, but other times in almost identical situations, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even just hit him.
It's not too much trouble with the reboot system, but it'll confidently disrupt you.
The restart is handled so that if you crash or go far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race all over again.
So they are more of a "fallback" than a reliable source of support.
But sometimes even rebounds don't help, they're solved by having to memorize a section of the race.
The great misfortune of the game is that the same things happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, require a specific way of driving, or you simply cannot get into them.
Other times, you'll find civilian vehicles in the same configuration at a given location, whether you're first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially irritating in situations where you see the competitor in front of you pass easily between two cars on the opposite side, while when you reach them, the cars are already in a position where you have to go around or brake.
It doesn't matter when you get there, because it's calculated to happen right under your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
You'll run into several places throughout the game, where again, no matter what time, you'll always be outrun by the same opponent in the same place.
It's the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The enemy must get there before you, apparently at any cost.
If it's in front of you, it's like it's getting in the way of the cars coming in, so you're just kind of getting a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit
The intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fueled is understandable, but the execution is so obvious that it's sure to make you sick quickly.
And that's a shame, because even with the simple ride model, the game is so much fun and action-packed that sometimes you literally don't have time to watch where things fly.
And it doesn't really matter if it's the concept of 50 unique tracks, the timing of the races so that there's no chance of boredom, or whatever.
An unusual idea is to switch cars during the race.
You have to be careful of gas stations on the roadside, because that's where you can change cars, even though in most cases you'll be satisfied with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American bull riders for straight highways, and exotic super sports for technical riding, such as on winding mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with a challenge mode, which is racing in locations you know from the story.
Here you not only earn medals, but experience points for your profile, which is common to both challenges and stories.
To get a higher level of driver, you unlock various items: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also linked to the online Autolog function, which compares your performance with other players and provides other community features.
Another hard-to-understand kick is the situation in the last race in the story.
You take your car into a subway tunnel where you go on the dark tracks.
You're flashing the speedometer at 150 to 200 kilometers an hour, and then the subway comes rushing in behind you and crushes you.
So we're going to have a debate in the editorial office for a few days about whether or not nobody really thought about it or whether or not the writers think we're such jerks.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual experience is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It freezes so that at some of the most tense moments, the imaging drops, in some cases quite tragically.
But this is especially true in a crash with a large number of participants, where you wouldn't be able to use the smooth shot anyway.
The soundtrack is fine, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a wider audience, the soundtrack was created in the category of "every dog a different village", but it is possible to assume that listening to the music will not buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so very confusing.
If the game avoided all unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS game in the last few years.
But that makes the game look unfinished.
I'm sure it's fun, but be prepared for the airport headlights to flash your mistakes.
UK choirs will play at the Velvet Students concert
Combining the celebrations of International Students' Day and the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical experience, the Festa Academica is offering the festival for the third time.
During the concert, he will perform for 20 high school and college choirs.
The main attraction of the festival is the two concerts held on November 17.
"Charles University has a big stake in the festival".
"The choirs participating are the Choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities, and the festival committee will be chaired by Rector Václav Hampl", said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organising team.
The highlight of the festival is a free concert by high school choirs, which will take place on November 17 at 2 p.m. in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes a song by the famous Czech jazzman Karl Růžička, Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening, a concert "Students of velvet" will be held in the ceremonial premises of the National House in Vinohrady, with university choirs, including the choirs of Charles University.
The aim of the Festa Academica is not only to celebrate the International Day of Students and the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to develop creative cooperation among young people.
The main organizer is the Union of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Jan Keplera High School.
The event was sponsored by the Mayor of Prague Bohuslav Svoboda and the Rector of Charles University Václav Hampl.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The schedule includes a number of musical events, student events, matinees and other events in addition to the festive concerts.
The festival is organised by the European Film Academy (EFA) and is organised by the European Film Council (EFC).
Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic
'The Lisbon Treaty has disturbed the balance between the various institutions quite significantly.'
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war".
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down, to calm down and for all the players to get used to their new roles", began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how serious she is about her motto 'Clear and Open about Europe' in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the EU institutions and their relations in a way that was so clear and understandable that many UK Law School lecturers could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was inconspicuous, that he was a gray clerk, that he could not fulfill any role, and I must say that everyone was blown away that he had adapted himself perfectly to the role".
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go".
She explained that the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was in response to the question: "Who is the European Union?
Nobody wants to ban us from the cheesecake.
Vicen also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency was a success.
The Czechs have dealt with the impending financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
The fall of the government at this time was then described as a big negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very strongly.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, the 'fact was wrong' was not only the Presidency but also the financial crisis that followed, which is still being addressed.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union still needs to be adopted, which is made more difficult by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, are all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
She also recalled her main slogan with which she had come to Brussels: 'Europe in a clear way'.
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, gibberish that nobody understands.
How can a citizen understand that Brussels does not really invent curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes or that someone really has to ban cherries".
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is ahead
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive side of things.
It also regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
She says a lot of factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write cover letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to see me and a Slovak comes, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what's up with your Visegrad Four?'
The future of the Union, according to Vicen, will be dominated by tough new rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
It sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new 'European federation', as very real.
"We have the eurozone countries and the non-eurozone countries".
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation".
"For the first time, it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those that did not want to stay away".
'There will be more of these institutions and it will be a strong two-speed Europe,' she expects.
It also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM's innovator enters its second century of existence
If someone were looking for the word that best describes IBM's strategy, the closest one would probably be "long-term".
To the general public, IBM is a symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is seen as very contemporary, and yet it has been 100 years since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by the company's first president, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already made the slogan that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold (and also the name of the internal magazine that began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement toward the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a century because it stayed true to its core values while not being afraid to change everything else around it.
This has allowed us to transform technology, business and society in our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next 100", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO.
Advanced system
Watson in the 1930s took care of his employees in a similar way to entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - IBM had, as one of the first American employees, paid vacation, employer insurance, plus elegant employee uniforms and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM's long-term customer relationship is just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant at recruiting talent from the start -- one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination so that people could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisan to be replaced as IBM president by a woman, Virginia Rometty, next year.
She's been at IBM for 30 years, still in charge of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing what's called pits, online brainstorming, for the last few years, which has spawned a lot of future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there are so many ideas - almost half a million people work at the company.
Institutions with a good reputation
The firm's strong internal and external image ensures its position in the business.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology company", Harvard Business School professor and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter told The Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems by using technology", added George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there's a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it is colloquially known in the United States because of its logo - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company and five of its employees have won Nobel Prizes.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode, and a floppy disk.
IBM, with about $220 billion, became the second-largest tech company by market capitalization this year (first behind Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Ahead
Not all products and innovations were to the taste of customers and the times - IBM, for example, did not succeed in betting on its own OS/2 operating system, the Prodigy online service or the IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you can't be emotionally bound to the past", notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on multiple platforms -- and if they don't work, they abandon them.
Unlike, say, competitor Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technologies
IBM's revenue is dominated by services, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
In 1990, it was the strongest hardware representative with more than half of the market.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, and invested $58 billion in the same period in acquiring promising technologies.
The investment has continued since 2008, when the world was first overtaken by the recent financial crisis.
IBM follows the legacy of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems IBM is going through the current crisis untouched.
IBM's stock price has soared by a whopping 120% since the beginning of 2008, and the company's net income is continually rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its values.
So it's to be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will handle it.
The history of IBM: From cheese cutters to space flights
IBM was founded in New York City over a hundred years ago, originally under the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924 - originally a trademark used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1880s.
They had technology like the famous "pipes", clocks that recorded employees' arrivals and departures.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as chairman of the company's board of directors until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still the building blocks of an unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began by manufacturing and selling all kinds of business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years Watson was at the helm, the company doubled its turnover to $9 million and began a massive expansion into all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost 40 years in the executive chair, his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., succeeded him.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM humans and computers helped NASA pilot missions to Mercury, Saturn, and the famous 1969 manned moon landing.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "piece of cake" that set the computer standard of the day, the IBM 5150 came out in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, bought the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to focus on consulting and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off for the last three years is the concept of a Smarter Planet.
It aims to make smart use of technology in areas not yet planned and to improve conditions, for example, in transport and urban management.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps retailers manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history at home.
It established its branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM Czech Republic, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team on voice recognition.
The story of an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) has said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtáře (53) became not only Iveta Bartošová's protector (45) but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she's not going to wait any longer and she's set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", explained Rychtár.
When Darina Rychtárová gave Bartoš asylum in her home last summer, she apparently had no idea how her marriage would end.
Despite Iveta's insistence that she move out of the Rieken after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned herself, reconciled with her husband, and now even said goodbye to him.
A knight doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Raptor and Bartoš ever broke up, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live out his life in our house together, no one will kick him out".
"But he will not live it as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties", revealed Rychtářová, adding that she had already separated from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Josef doesn't mind that Darina closed the back door.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to be with Ivetta, and I'm not going to change that".
"My wife arranged a paper marriage, and I respect that".
"The company is moving forward, I'm doing repairs, gardening, real estate, shopping".
"Darina and I have a normal conversation, except we don't share a bed", said Lightning.
If Richter finds a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, or if she has any friends.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", concluded Josef.
Worst Women's Habits: Do They Affect You?
If you ask men to name any typical female vices, they usually come up with one of them very quickly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, which list several female vices that can perfectly pump blood through men's veins?
Purchasing
Does your significant other blame you for being a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one new dress a week?
Do you like to shop at a discounted rate?
Then in your case, you could say that shopping is a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least curb their shopping spree.
But who would resist just walking around a clothing store, looking for a good-fitting outfit, and then trying them all on in the booth (ideally in different colors)?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can be a literal hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your man to wait for you outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least 10 pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these phrases ring a bell?
I mean, right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are just allergic to their partners constantly complaining about their looks.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent these complaints are, the more annoying the women are.
Putting Order and Cleanliness First
It's like an endless loop.
She washes windows, vacuums, wipes the floor, wipes the dust, scrubs the bathtub - at least twice a week.
You blame your partner for stepping on a clean floor with his dirty foot, the kids for dirtying an abrasive sink and covering the glass wall of your living room that you worked so hard to polish?
If you suffer from this "perversion", try to realize that nothing should be overdoing it and that order and cleanliness should not be the priority in your family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships and your family's well-being.
Rattling
"Throw those used panties in the trash".
"Are you gonna wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the floor".
If you yell at your partner several times a day, you can make him or her more likely to get angry.
Of course, you don't mean any harm, you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't be picking on them so much...
Slandering and gossiping
For some women, slander, gossip, but also insults and conspiracies against someone are also common.
Women are relationship-oriented, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope each of us will let out a little harmless gossip or slander here and there.
Hand on heart, it's a thing that happens to all women.
On the other hand, the most vulgar gossip, which is often gossipy and enjoyable, may be contemptuous of everyone and especially dangerous to those around them - especially among the female workforce.
Jagr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with assists
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr contributed two assists in Philadelphia's 5:3 win on the ice at Carolina on Monday and is once again leading the Czech players in productivity in the competition.
The 30-year-old star's performance benefited Claude Giroux, who added another touchdown and was named MVP.
Two assists in the match were recorded by Jagr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jagr told the overseas press that he predicted Giroux's big night.
"I told him before the game he'd score a hat trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you get that feeling", explained Jagr, after Giroux scored the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second goal of the team had a Czech trail.
The Thunderbolt was out there fighting for a Hurricanes' home run and handing it to scorer Max Talbot in the ring.
A second before the first half, a weakened home run by Patrick Dwyer, but the Flyers were back in the second half.
Specifically the Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored the third goal, then his shot was melted down by a flow in the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockey player like him".
"I'm glad to hear it".
"I want to play it".
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to play me, now it's back", Jagr added.
Carolina made a dramatic play, with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer, who came from the penalty spot, scoring a goal.
But Matt Read didn't allow any further complications, finishing the countdown two to one.
"Pronger has struck out in our band".
"He pushed the wheel, I picked up speed, and [Read] went to the far rod".
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked", Voráček described the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia wins the Eastern Conference title.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play the game against Buffalo, he retired in the second quarter due to an upper body injury.
The Candiens lost the two-goal lead to the Candiens and lost 2 to 3 on penalties.
One of their raids did not transform Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach was more concerned about the back row than the missing points, with only five defenders in the end zone.
"This is bad".
"We only had one experienced player to finish the fight, the rest were young men".
"But there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"We took turns getting hit and we couldn't resist".
"We should have simplified the game, moved the puck out of our zone".
We had gaps in that", added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 shots to Winnipeg's 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which ended a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different shooters.
How fares have developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state-owned travel agencies were authorised in what was then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold only tours to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists thus went on holiday to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia was subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovaks too) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but you had to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" at the travel agency.
But it wasn't won anyway.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition of travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange pledge it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for travel to the West.
However, by far the most common holiday was spent in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of huts and cottages being built by the Czechs, a practice that survives to this day.
Travel in the Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our top priorities until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The enormous paradox, which we no longer realize, is that Croatia, which is now our most popular country, was not free to travel to until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia.
As early as the early 1990s, visa requirements for neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna, Austria, and Germany.
For a long time, Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough of trips to the West, everyone wanted to see it for a while.
For example, in Paris, we slept in tents during Czech trips to parks because our income at the time did not allow us to afford a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of traveling Czechs at this time was to bring their own food, canned goods, salami, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech króna, which finally allowed our tourists to buy Western currency freely after many decades.
But our living standards and, with them, average wages were rising, leading to another important moment in 1997.
The increase in demand for travel has led to the regular introduction of charter flights by travel agents since 1997, which have made flights incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility of booking volume discounts.
By the late 1990's, the Czechs had visa-free access to virtually all developed countries except the United States, which made our travels easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when due to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight to exotics was made from the Czech Republic to Thailand.
From this year, direct charter flights to warm far-flung countries will be launched with Czech tourists every year.
The exotic country is now visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States cancelled visas for Czech tourists, and our country was definitively ranked among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in history (50.3%) and spent more than CZK 15 000 per person on a single holiday abroad including the cost of accommodation.
The general assembly is to find a chairman, but again, there is a trap
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and the threat that Ivan Hašek's successor at the helm of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general assembly, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburka.
The Commission has not yet reached agreement on the electoral procedure.
Without it, the vote won't even begin on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in running Czech football.
Hašek resigned in June and, in his departure, called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hashk era, football has slipped back into the gaps between the two chambers of the union, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly evident on September 16, when a new president was to be chosen.
Delegates of the general assembly gathered in the National House in Prague on Smíchov in vain, because the meeting remained blocked and it was not just a matter of election.
The Commission has not yet decided whether the voting rights of the members of the Board of Directors are to be exercised by the members of the Board of Directors.
On this single point, partial agreement has since been reached, helped by the recommendation of the Constitution on State and Law, according to which full representation is not possible.
But there are still disputes over the electoral system.
The Executive Committee, which no longer deals with anything else in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, has not made the situation too clear either.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do we proceed in round three to eliminate the possibility of a trap?
"The dispute is whether to follow the statutes or find another model", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
According to the proposed model, the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win in the third round.
Morava is reportedly willing to step down to win the candidate with the highest percentage of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side also asserts that the winner must have at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage addition.
"But if this were to make sense of the previous two rounds, it would completely negate the two-chamber concept", he understands the objections of the Moravian Svoboda party, according to which the best order would be to not bend and vote according to the current statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral procedure determined by the statutes suits Pelt the most of all candidates.
"I wish the vote to be held as strictly as possible".
"So that no representative nonsense like the last general meeting", said the owner of the company, Viktorie Pilzeň, who is running for the first time and in his comments was mainly against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He said the new president will be known in Nymburk and he hoped the candidates would work together constructively in the future.
"All the passions will be calmed by the possible progress of the national team today for the European Championship".
"Football will be back on a happy note, there will be more willingness to cooperate", says the official from the city, who has the most experience of all three in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided".
"It's not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations".
"This may cause the blockade of the general assembly to resume".
"But I hope common sense wins", said Reichl.
There's not much time left for a deal on all sides.
Some of the negotiations were supposed to take place in Montenegro, but who knows if the football team will be complete before the match.
The flight special, which was supposed to take Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica, did not fly from Prague this morning due to a technical failure and an alternative was being sought to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barge retaliation.
Eventually, there may be a crucial ministerial meeting, which may reportedly take place on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobes, would like to bring the two sides of the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general assembly of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sacka's financial problems.
Paclik goes to the presidential race because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of the Pilsen football team, Tomáš Paclík, had seen a strong candidate who would fulfill all his expectations for the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) before the extraordinary general assembly, he would not have even signed up to fight for the top position.
"If there is a good adept, I fight for him and I'm not running".
"But in the current situation, no one like that has been found", said ČTK Paclík.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Reichel, Paclik is motivated to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, from becoming the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that if he wins, he will only be able to hold office until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly is on the agenda.
He would like to see an experienced and top-notch manager who is not too involved in football.
"I've spoken to some people who might be of interest".
"It was crazy for me when some people said that at this moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football".
"I would like to change that view", he said.
Paclik says that what bothers him most now is Pelt's connection to the president of the Pilsen County Football Association, Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
It's so unacceptable for Paclik to have Pelta in the chair.
"If he wins, the status quo will be preserved and nothing will move forward in football".
"Combined with Berber's support, who is a capable businessman, it would not be any more beneficial to football", Paclík said.
He also points out that Pelt's name was mentioned in the dispatch years ago in a corruption investigation, but Pelt got away with it.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's win would bring to football".
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclík, who also takes into account his previous statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became president".
If Paclik wins Thursday's election, he could imagine a future partnership with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to".
"He has great abilities".
"I could picture him as the head of the national team".
"But he would not manage the association".
"I don't stick my nose in things I don't know", said Paclík, who in September attracted a lot of attention by standing up for the dismissal of the panel of judges led by Luďek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik says he'd dare to run the association.
He has been in charge of the club since last summer, and with his support, the club won the Premier League in May.
"I have the power to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its cultivation".
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commissions, which goes to the point of being disgusting", said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy for the Spartan chief Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider strengthening the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee as one of his priorities, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into sports.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be doing".
"If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say where the money is going", he noted.
Paclík does not consider his connection to the Pilsen club a burden, although he himself claims that the FAČR president should be "supra-party".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see the point in transferring my shares in the club to someone in a hypocritical way and then going back in a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes to the FAC that would eliminate electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would work to ensure that the FAC has new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral procedure in the future.
The official from Jablonec is optimistic ahead of Thursday's Nymburka hearing and believes the campaign will significantly dampen the eventual success of the national football team today.
Pelta had promised before the failed election in September that he would focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the polls before the last general assembly, so a two-month delay could be useful to defend and present his ideas on football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be announced on Thursday".
"He feels it's high time someone took the lead", says a man who is associated primarily with the apple orchard club but who has served for many years on Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
He also believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current election problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought".
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we would have had a president as early as September", Pelta said.
He was just reworking the most important civil society document as a wake-up call to delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal responsibility and I am willing to take personal responsibility if I fail".
"It's a matter of principle that we can't live without", says Pelta.
He's still trying not to pick against his rivals.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he respects for his legal education, and knows well that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He didn't attack Tomáš Paclík for long, who, on the other hand, didn't let the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some successes".
"His attacks, however, were disgraceful and many people jumped at the chance of a campaign".
"Therefore, many of them now doubt his true character", he said of Pelt, who is said to be loyal to a proclamation he announced in September.
He says his most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football, from the lowest levels to the national team.
That should be the football locker.
"And I would also try to end all the scandals starting with the Bohemians case or the echoes of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately rush to negotiations with the private and public sectors to secure enough money for the whole football", the 46-year-old candidate told the Czech Republic Football Federation two months ago.
He also promised that his coming to the helm of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would have to get acquainted with the job description of the individual employees first", he said of Strahov, where a long absence of government has led to understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general assembly, they believe that the delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday in vain.
"If the only issue is how the third round will go, we can get through it".
"Football needs credibility, and the only way to get it is to finally have a leader", Pelta remains optimistic two days before what may be the defining day of his career as a public official.
Reichl promises that under him, the FAZR will start working hard
If the current vice-president Jindřich Rajchl were elected as the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Thursday general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Reichl has promised to work hard if he is elected.
He wants to push for systemic changes and make executive committee members responsible for football's individual areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue the work started by the previous president Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to focus on football as a whole".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, professional football, performance football to youth football".
"But I'm not saying I'd do everything myself", Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to allocate responsibilities in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area".
"And I'm going to give hard work to make sure that in every segment of the game, football moves forward one mile".
"I think a lot of people would be unhappy about it because it would make you work really hard and not just criticize the work of others", he added.
He said that because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't be left behind by people who will constantly throw sticks at me and question my every move", he explained why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me not to give up because then others would give up too".
"It is a trust I cannot throw away", he said.
He's also motivated to continue the work he started with Hague.
"A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away".
"There are processes that have started that will only have an impact in a few years, and I would not like to see them stopped", he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the union could return to the pre-Hague era.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta is good at".
"It's mostly people who would make football for the chosen ones".
"I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not for favouring someone".
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to play football for everyone, because then everyone will be happy, not just the chosen ones", Reichl remarked.
He also refutes the claim that he was just a Czech president.
"Despite what some people try to say, I plan to do my best for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league".
"There would be no current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", said Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík is also involved in the fight for the presidency, Reichl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees that I have clear achievements behind me", said Rajchl, who credits saving tens of millions of crowns on bad contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating a lottery law as his achievements.
Rather, he feels that he is complicit in the fact that the marriage is not going well.
While he declares Pelt "disqualified from restoring trust in Czech football", he sees another of his rivals, Paclik, as a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job in Pilsen that year".
"If he had been elected, he would have continued the work that Ivan Hašek started here and not changed the personnel of the committees in any way".
"He wouldn't want to turn it to his advantage", rated rivals Rachl.
The Most Beautiful Pools in Europe
Jump to blue
I 'm not going to .
The UFO's view of the swamp, the luxurious pool in Budapest: Travellers in Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after sightseeing or traveling, let their tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show you where the water wellness is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder set out on her explorations a year and a half ago, she couldn't have missed one thing in her suitcase: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the artistically shaped domes, swam across the marble putti (the figures of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)), which awaited her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau floats.
If she liked a building, she would quickly put it in her diary - including remarkable details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 bathing facilities have been explored in this way by architectural historian Meder and are now presented in her newly published book 'Badefreuden': the People's Baths in Munich, the historic Palace of the Baths in Schwarzwald, the 'Hard core of concrete buildings' in Taunus.
Her 'Journey to the Most Unusual Baths in Central Europe' took her through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swimming culture enthusiast.
Meder says that sports are not overrated - only in water.
The only irritating thing is that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can breathe the intoxicating scent of pine forests or listen to the merry chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so ugly", says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice floats".
Water levels are doubling architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential oils for the sauna - the comfort factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the baths can be a real treat for the eyes: "In place of the floor, you have the water level in the baths".
"It's transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is optically duplicated: the high vault, the colorful stoves, the jump boards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic oases of Wellness - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by a collector of floats, Mrs. Meder, while searching in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful thermal baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
While the Zurich rooftop pool offers a view of the city, the outdoor pool at St. Anton's offers a view of the snow-covered Arlberg - and: The steam rooms have a window to view the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits the spa guests in Längenfeld: the Akvapark Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
Steam rises from three open pots in the winter as it looks up into the sky against the backdrop of Ötztal Mountain.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool collector Mrs. Meder has a chlorine smell in their nostrils.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, and the Árpád Baths in Békéssaba, Hungary, smell of heating oil to the point that one would hardly believe that one has entered a thermal bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal water, which is almost black with its alkali hydrocarbon compounds, and the sediment sticks to the skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a rather unusual wellness experience.
But there was another place Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for nice baths: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate baths of Luhačovice, she came across a closed area.
In 1902, the baths designed by architect Dušan Jurković were closed.
As Mrs. Meder looked out the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw a huge weed growing among the tiles.
They faced destruction in the magical spa in Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
The baths have already undergone three phases of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements that date back to the time of their construction in 1844, but also the Alhambra-style Moorish hall, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful renovation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favourite spa resort of the pool connoisseur Iris Meder, not only because she is from Schwarzwald.
"It is quite an achievement to combine such a variety of building styles into such a beautiful complex", says Mrs. Meder.
In a palace like this, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank has a commodities review.
♪ I'm not going to lie ♪
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its business in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor world.
Then in January, the head of the company wants to draw conclusions.
- What is it ?
For federal citizens, the point is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize, according to one study.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other lenders exit the deal because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
That's the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity markets are driving prices higher and that banks are therefore complicit in the world's hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank CEO Joseph Ackermann, although big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also doing the same.
Originally, commodity betting was intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that capital market participants, with their interest in high-risk trades, have disengaged from supply and demand - and have been profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to check the reprimands and said that no deal "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international task force is reviewing the criticism from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors - together with a recommendation on how to handle it.
The bank's officials then want to announce their conclusions by the end of January.
The end result could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann is working on his image.
While welcoming the report, Foodwatch's chief executive, Thilo Bode, intensified his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how ruthlessly banks are harming the common good today".
Let Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, do his job.
'Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items where money is used to bet on food prices,' Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Mr. Ackermann is concerned about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's vision may seem surprising at first glance, but it's clear that the CEO would like to leave a perfect image a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not be joining the supervisory board as planned.
By turning away from contentious agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about any losses - that should be left to his successor.
One in two would say that investing in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
According to this, only 11% consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that involve food price bets.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions: One in two would be asked to cancel all investments where money is diverted to commodity speculation.
Forty-three percent would warn a friend about such a bank, and 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account and moving to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion relocated
I 'm not going to lie .
A story of architecture with its peaks, its falls and its happy end: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, and remained empty and deserted.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it burns for modern postwar architecture, for the clear forms, the glass halls, the bold swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a fitting and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight, high-impact steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a landmark in modern architecture.
He made the architect famous by building the Austrian pavilion for the next World's Fair.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW-Palace plus a key side-building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Designed as a temporary exhibition building after the World Exhibition, the pavilion was placed in the Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern Railway Station), renovated and opened in 1962 as the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
The building was not suitable for the museum, either spatially or technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new booth in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and deteriorating more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, now bearing the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition there - a happy intention in every respect.
A new beginning was made by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Austrian Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, including as a skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Musee Moderna Salzburg, pushed hard for reconstruction among politicians and monuments, secured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined its use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotrba were to be exhibited by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookstore were to be built, and an office building had to be built.
Strict oversight, low budget.
Krischanitz was the perfect cast for the performance.
Not only did he sensibly renovate and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Josef Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna, the pavilion was "an extremely important place" for him, where he visited exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and re-purposed.
The current reconstruction was far more challenging: The building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, fiberglass reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold steel girder bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were remediated.
Two underground floors provided space for new uses, a lighting duct between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the stately Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the theater is still exactly the same as it was before.
And all this with strict supervision from the Heritage Office and a low budget.
"Often, material that is good and cheap and that the antiquities office liked had to be found", says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
The difficulty was with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City story".
Such architecture, he says, is "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "have the right self-esteem".
In this case, however, the 21st century building is not out of place, because an urban coincidence has occurred: a completely newly designed "City Quarter at the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is being built in the vicinity of the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence will happen: the 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and is reportedly already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood in the Schweizer Garten.
The railroad is planning a million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railroad has put out a contingency plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It's going to cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The 'Bild' newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal plan, that it expected to invest a total of around EUR 300 million by 2015.
It is intended to make better use of trains and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16 000 to remove snow from railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to clear the platform before starting operations and 90 percent of the switches needed to operate within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned after a high-level meeting with government and industry representatives of train outages and delays also this winter.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, due to, among other things, a lack of reserves during difficult weather conditions.
For years, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways.
In addition, there are delays in the ICE train departure.
The line has also been struggling for years with the fact that it seems to have to have the axles of ICE trains checked more often in the workshop after the axle was destroyed on one ICE train at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank is paying a million-dollar fine in the United States
After the uproar over the boss of the bank, Joseph Ackermann, there are new trumpets in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in damages.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the industry giant has caught up with its past in the United States: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (€106 million) in one settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is a sale of mortgage bonds.
The NCUA accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they have reduced risks.
Such securities lost much of their value during the crisis and brought banks down with them.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the matter without having to take the parties to court", said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank has not admitted any wrongdoing in the settlement.
That goes for Citigroup, which has committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz has welcomed the hospitality of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to recover billions in damages.
The settlements now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also targeted other large banks, suing JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The questionable mortgage notes are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it was a disaster for many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investment Bank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place several years ago, the banks are now facing a headwind.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or to punish the wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It involves 18 major international banks that two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, disadvantaged some $200 billion in mortgage transactions.
Deutsche Bank is also facing the FHFA lawsuit, involving a number of transactions totalling approximately USD 14,2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be liable for 'substantial losses', without however specifying an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and stated that it intended to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
He's bought over $10 billion worth of stock since March.
Warren Buffett, the most prominent American investor to date, has always said that he would not invest in IT and computers because the long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
But now he's read IBM's business news and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's achievement in the financial world.
As a result, the parent company of IBM IT can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett revealed on CNBC that he bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that IBM didn't know about his involvement.
He praised management for trying to make even decent profits during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long been investing in lucrative IT services such as operating data centers.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as high-performance business computers.
Buffett has largely avoided tech companies to this day.
It claims to only invest in companies whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett turned to the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machinery manufacturer.
His Berkshire Hathaway holding company, in addition to some 80 of its own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old took over a small textile company in the 1960s, Berkshire Hathaway, and with wise investments, built it into one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Yet, his way of life is modest.
That's why he's an iconic figure to many investors around the world.
His almost unerring sense of making money earned him the nickname "The Oracle of Omaha".
When Buffett's investment became public, IBM's stock rose by one percent before the stock market opened.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, has a combined market capitalization of more than $220 billion and is ranked alongside Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett would not want to do it.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be a close friend of his.
The threat is tangible
After the Zwickau Cells were exposed, the Turkish media questioned the German rule of law.
The newspapers even talk of a "bloody ideology" now reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
The news was met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a specter long thought dead is being re-awakened: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been in doubt.
But the discovery of a far-right network reveals a scale that has long since been overlooked.
"Is bloody ideology alive again?" was the headline of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was a secret police agent from the constitutional protection unit and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany has reacted with caution: It recalled the weekend demonstrations by silencing victims of racist violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish Community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish conscription agreement.
In cheerful colors, a life together was staged - a success story.
The news from several Turkish media outlets is a check box: "German gift to the 50s" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform Haber X that reports on the background of the murder series.
The publication of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be considered as not having made this connection.
"It's starting to smell", is the headline of a column by Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made important contributions to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critical discussion in German-Turkish Internet forums is the police's conduct and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much earlier, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically shown to be ready to resort to drastic measures: "If the activity here continues so superficially, immigrants will have nothing but self-defense and armament".
"That's probably the best self-defense".
"The quality of the investigation and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network are very much dependent on the internal peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
Which means if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Solingen incinerator is deeply engraved in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and withdrawal can lead to right-wing violence.
But the assassinations made a sense of reciprocity more apparent on the Turkish side.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time was particularly critical of the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who had survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, but was represented at a memorial service in Cologne by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, who calculated the taxes paid by the Turks in his speech.
It's almost as if a man's worth is measured by his tax dollars.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again the deep distrust of many German Turks in the Turkish legal system.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
The Scandal Bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most innovative bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has slipped from one crisis to another since then.
Now it's up to some German to make up for it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't mean it that way.
Following his noisy departure from the management of the Bundesbank, it became known in July 2013 that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job: chairman of the board of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was happy in public, praising Switzerland for both its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached turnover".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But by September, it was clear that things would be very different.
A dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted approximately EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a respected banker not only in Switzerland, had to step down.
The chairman of the board of UBS has also been a bit of a mess since then - and everyone is asking: when will Axel Weber finally come?
It's become known that Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough on Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's more of an economics professor and an emissions banker, and he'd definitely need some time to work it out.
He will then take over responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just once again proved itself worthy of the title of "Europe's most scandalous bank".
Because UBS is huge -- until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world -- and it's been slipping from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid but also astute wealth manager combines with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a name for herself in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 on the one hand managed $1.6 trillion more wealthy client money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it's advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Former banker and later longtime professor of banking at Zurich, Hans Geiger, recalls: "I always gave UBS as a model of a good bank to my students back then".
"From today's perspective, one asks, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, the chairman of the board, Peter Wuffle, who was once considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, he knew why he left.
The bank's investment division lost subprime bonds and had to write off billions.
To cope with this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
Instead, she found real investors, but investors she would have been embarrassed to look at until recently: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so discreet you didn't even know its name.
But that was just the first impression.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to admit new billions of losses, the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, still the second highest paid board member in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster ensued: UBS was facing a financial crisis due to its bad investments before it collapsed and had to be rescued by the State.
The Nationalbank bought tens of billions of troubled securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation put up CHF 6 billion in convertible bonds, which allowed it to become a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shocked - for they realized how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, UBS' 2007 balance sheet total was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"We could not save UBS again", says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
UBS has capitulated to this for months in a tax dispute with America and has shown willingness to release the data of wealthy customers who, if possible, helped the banks cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million in restitution for the proceeds of these transactions, including a penalty payment.
UBS has more or less openly admitted that it has helped to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not what it used to be.
The resignation of the Chief Executive and the Chairman of the Board of Directors followed.
And an exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both of its core business areas: investment banking for bad speculation and asset management to help cut taxes.
And just when things had calmed down a little bit, just when UBS was thought to be recovering, here comes this unfortunate business anabaxy: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"In the case of Adobe, it seems that the risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz Professor of Finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: 'The problem with UBS is that it cannot control risks.'
But this was exactly the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers took a long time ago to become the guardians of the world's great assets: no too big risks, but security for money - and from this side of the Alpine Republic, the world collapsed again.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become symbols of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for exceptional quality chocolate.
UBS' Zurich headquarters still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is classic.
The bank has its head office on the Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rents of the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery shops such as Tiffany's are found here among traditional Swiss shops such as Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries, it has been home to Swiss banks, from the Nationalbank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are paved with marble, fronted by massive leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo, a large "safe" sign.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The Swiss bank's idea was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank found out.
He'd rather not read his name in the newspapers, so he ends up doing business with both big banks, like all Swiss bankers.
UBS has probably grown too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
I guess the Swiss have nothing to say about that.
"And if they did, they adapted long ago to Anglo-Saxon ways".
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, bringing it first high profits and then disaster: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was obvious.
"On Wednesday, the coalition government of a small country of seven million decided to launch the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
As much as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, was approved by politicians to save a bankrupt big bank.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to the Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a large concern.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it kept growing.
This was helped by the complementarity of UBS's two distinct banking predecessors: a wealthy but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management and a poorer but more internationally involved bank.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers had a lot of money to play the big roulette with.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought that Wuffle and Ospel were the team of the future", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffle, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut-feeling man who's worked his way up from banking science".
But I hear the donkey relied on Wuffle to the end.
And Wuffle probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "I guess he thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, I suppose.
Clearly, pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffle repeated the same slogan over and over again:
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It listed "League Tables", a ranking that documents the success of banks in that era.
UBS was trying to get to the top of the list.
She's already made a few steps.
She was at the top of the game in the foreign exchange and stock markets.
But the corporate advisors who were in charge point out a weakness: In international interest trading, in the language of "Fixed Income" bankers, there seems to be a big gap behind the biggest banks.
UBS seems to have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. subprime investments.
It developed into a mighty machine that repackaged securities into U.S. mortgages and passed them on - while keeping the risks to itself.
Even when the other banks were looking for a way out.
"As late as the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying", says banking expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the cleanup efforts were harder than expected.
The UBS positions became a catapult seat and are still swinging.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has all the nearby business models gone.
The banking expert Geiger has an idea: end investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
That's as far as the bank wants to go.
But investment banking is going to be down sharply, that's clear now.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, is going to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually seen as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly split with its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has made his mark: he will run UBS's long-term business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3500 places are cut.
But that's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's eating it?
What's he gonna do for money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is asking himself right now.
But publicly, he says he's only going to find an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
- I'll see you next year.
Fear of recession in Europe is weighing on the U.S. stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has discouraged American investors from starting the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.
The slowdown in industrial production on the Continent has stifled the seed of hope for stabilizing the debt crisis.

This has made US investors skeptical. "We are not an island, we are dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe is unlikely to recover from the recession as quickly as it did, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: he said in a CNBC interview that it might not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it can to end the crisis.
So it's probably too early for him to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds". But the highly intelligent animals have long since been driven out of cities, say experts.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quickly: Crows have been a part of the city's image for centuries, yet in some villages residents complain of dirt and noise caused by the animals.
Yet, no remedy is yet in sight against "problem birds".
The field crow may no longer be driven from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
Experts from all over the country were consulted on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
Conservationists have also deduced that the problems of cities stem from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemicals in agriculture seems to be increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the building up, and the felling of typical trees for nesting make life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with over 600 nesting pairs are found in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer, among others.
There, a controversial 2005 project to mass-kill crows in a rural county drew negative headlines.
Critics have called the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of the stick particularly brutal.
"Normal evictions, scare, bring nothing", found urbanist and landscape designer Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has unintended consequences, said environment expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies split and spread to other places".
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out".
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of the mayor of Leer, Wolfgang Kellner.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive habitat areas and luring them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
In contrast, "Information boards instead of chainsaws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "A pimple on the face is the best way to end self-confidence".
In Schleswig-Holstein, Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Science Crow Trail, where information boards provide information about the life of a highly intelligent field crow.
The project is reportedly already attracting tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the noise caused by birds, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion: "Every volume of communication is involved here, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: Not only do field ravens use aids to reach their nest, but they even make their own tools to help them.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the behavior of four field ravens to see how far the birds' intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to have the stones bring down the structure to get to the mole larva.
Without much training, they figured out what size and shape a rock would have to be to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the greasy crows then had to solve a more bizarre problem.
In the vertical warp, the researchers placed a small container of mole larvae.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers put bits of wire in there.
She used them to make hooks for all four animals, using them as bait to catch the container by the handle.
Three of the four field ravens even made it to the stop.
Cristiano Ronaldo is shooting for Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the Cup have not come true.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won their last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-overall superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53), Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made their fifth consecutive appearance in the European Championship perfect after a 0-0 draw in the first leg.
The Czech Republic were satisfied with a 1-0 score in the rematch against outsider Montenegro, when the first match was already a clear thing.
Croatia also missed a goal with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland scored a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) added goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional of the Bundesliga Zvjezdan Misimovic converted a penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was given a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already disappointed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal's start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon was a smooth one.
Ronaldo quickly took the lead with a free kick from about 30 yards into the net.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range shooting skills and made a 25-yard field goal to make it 2-0.
The Bosnians, who had no action in the first half, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edina Dzek.
The former Wolfsburg player from the English club at the head of the table of the Manchester City club placed the ball with his head on the bottom edge of the log, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
In the end, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood in the centre.
After the action against Helder Postig in Bosnian penal territory, Stark decided in favor of Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card (36).
On the other side, Stark delivered a controversial penalty kick after Fabio Coentraa's action, which definitely turned Misimovic.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up cleared it all with four goals.
Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
With that, the 1976 European champion leaves for the fifth consecutive European Championship.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legend Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the opening phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexically prevented Tomáš Sivok's possible own goal at the last moment (9).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the corner of the penalty area just outside Čech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked out world-class Czech goalkeeper, again reduced by the striker FC Soul (50.).
Branka finally clarified things just before the end.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle at that moment.
Four days after a 0-3 draw in Istanbul, the Turks are still 0-0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to vacate his third-place spot at the 2002 World Cup, Croatia is enjoying its fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks are set for an almost fabulous start.
Selcuk Inan hit the bar in the seventh minute with a long shot, Kazim also couldn't get the ball to hang in the goal.
But after that terrible second, Croatia was taking over more and more.
Croatia also missed the cut.
Besides Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund's Ivan Perisice from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga's Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first appearance at the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward has brought the team of Giovanni Trapattoni, who had managed a 4-0 lead in the first game, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) made the score for the guests.
Ireland had the pace from the start, but they had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian defense prevented a possible front-runner.
But in the 32nd minute, it was pretty far.
After a failed defense by goalie Paul Londak, Ward was in position to push the ball across the line to make it 1-0.

SAP wants to double its workforce in China.
Europe's largest software maker SAP is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double its workforce in the country.
The company is expected to generate about $2 billion (about €1.5 billion) in revenue by 2015, Dax said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and employ the appropriate personnel", said deputy chief executive Bill McDermott at the Beijing Consumer Fair.
The workforce has now increased from the current 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of the world's top-selling enterprise software companies will double from five to 10 or 11.
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
About 4,000 of SAP's more than 176,000 customers worldwide are booming in the country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's strategy for 2015.
SAP aims to increase turnover to EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs took in around 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the software company, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is doing business as well as ever before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"We would like to expand our activities now (...) ", said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through extensive research".
A massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's new, emotionally charged book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, opens with a list of characters so long that you'll feel dizzy.
A suggestion for you to make at this time is to carefully tear out this page and make a bookmark.
Because you'll get to know all the characters in Mr. Englund's novel very well, and this list will serve as a navigation - a kind of beacon - for you at times when, like the men and women in the story, you feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new vice president of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are discussing is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "an antihistorical work".
It contains several very famous names, important treaties or famous battles, but it is almost devoid of ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions of tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as a "book about what it was like".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the wartime experiences of 20 men and women, more or less a dozen, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, become crippled, go mad, or die.
Their lives flickering like the flames of a church candle - new ones being added to the web of destiny while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that World War I was all about the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book deal with problems of being hit by a beehive, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of a pyramid, or dealing with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it's been a very moving read.
War will consume people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
If you hear cannon fire in the distance and you're a woman at home with your children, will you run or stay?
Who's that coming?
Almost no one understands what's happening, even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts", noted Mr. Englund, "was filled by speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are largely taken from biographies, letters, and other published material.
Their descriptions of life may sound intimidating and captivating, but the inclusion of minute moments and details makes them completely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Substitute, substitute everywhere".
"Coffee topping, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons, and so on".
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and supplemented with a fake wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes for sausage and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American, finding his inner drive for savagery and brutality, declares about war: "You will finally understand that this is human nature, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey and the evening paper or a good book and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization and that behind this starchy self there is no barbarian".
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will notice, let alone mourn.
"When one finally accepts the sacrifice, one would at least expect it to be done before the eyes of an appreciative audience", he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict being hung in secret".
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the rise of new terrors.
"Conflict increasingly became economic competition and a competitive struggle", writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories".
He caught what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a vocal and ideologically sworn mass murderer in tailored clothes who carries out his bloodletting without leaving the table".
People act completely unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexually transmitted disease from prostitutes to avoid serving in the front.
"The most egregious example of this was the trade in gonorrhoea pus, which soldiers bought and rubbed on their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"The most desperate of them rubbed it in their eyes, often blinded them for the rest of their lives".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is lively but not flashy, which is a perfect fit for his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, he shows how the war "unleashed forces beyond our control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on World War I usually worked with hints rather than a comprehensive narrative, such as Paul Fussell's World War I and Modern Memory or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.
Mr Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating ending that has been found in popular science literature.
But I won't tell you.
But you'll feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from your hero list out of your hand, and burned it.
After the previous mistake, this time a minute-by-minute raid.
Hundreds of police officers participated, some wearing helmets used in street riots.
Monday night was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the operation except a few high-ranking officers, and others were initially told it was a drill.
The event was led by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted the many challenges the police department faced in the operation.
The use of pepper spray against protesters, for example, violated the rules of the department and the public's sympathy for the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was not launched until two weeks of careful planning and training.
The leaders were inspired by the operations in other cities.
A massive crisis behaviour exercise was held on Randall's Island in preparation for an event at Zuccotti Park.
Officials have stepped up so-called riot control training - counterterrorism measures that include the rapid deployment of large numbers of police - with a focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training was held on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute", said someone to whom the action was initially explained only as "exercise".
"I know a few officers who were also called to the event, and they certainly were not told that they were going to Zuccotti Park", said a person who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest level of the department knew about the Zuccotti Park trip".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, city officials were scheduled to clean up the park, but then they backed out because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's action involved police officers from various units, including local task forces - dozens of police officers who are routinely used to reinforce neighborhoods with higher crime levels.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, the park has a large influx of people, so one o'clock in the morning was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible", he said.
Before the units left, they lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplifiers.
Lights and a recorded message from the amplifiers frightened many protesters.
When members of the security forces entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters packed their bags and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack.
Other police teams have been seen gathering at the edge of the park to break in if an arrest is needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists feel that the police did not want them to see their troops in action, and some police officers treated them harshly.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street leading along the western boundary of the park could film without any problems.
Police moved westward, intertwined with a thick pile of protesters' personal belongings, including bags and plastic bags full of clothes, and were followed by sanitation teams who immediately scooped up everything left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park, documenting footage that appeared online shortly after.
The most violent group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their campsite, which lay near the center of the park.
Some of them set up a roadblock and the police began methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp had strapped together.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut through the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly reported.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Brown said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "organizing riots and resisting arrest", he explained.
The highest ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the police department, the highest ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective division, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "was not involved in the operation", Mr. Browne said.
The second group of officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to be called.
There are roadblocks on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these locations, the police then extended the safety belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of them wearing shields, were seen pushing people further across the border.
There were about 28 people at the northern border.
The wildest action of the night was south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester was seen jumping on the hood of a police car and several others were seen blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of pebble flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers is going to sue the city for dismissal.
Unions representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
A court appeal is probably the last option left for the unions in District Council 37 in their attempt to overturn the dismissal order.
On October 7, 672 school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees, some of the city's lowest paid, lost their jobs, which union leaders described as retaliation for the city's failure to allow them access to a labor-managed health care fund last spring, which the city sought to use to patch a hole in the budget.
The city officials flatly denied the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the board members immediately countered that the budget made no specific mention of laying off auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials have announced that they have completed the necessary paperwork and have warned the Department of Education that they will sue him, and they are holding a press conference Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
The defendants in this case will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight dismissed employees, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, and will not comment on individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by The New York Times, the unions targeted the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city to support their claims of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were long denied adequate funding.
They show that while there were no school layoffs at all and only minimal ones on the Upper East Side, 17 school assistants were laid off in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, and 46 in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
She recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. "This is not a neighborhood full of spoiled parents who can raise the funds to make up the budget deficit", the lawsuit says.
Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated bonus funds for every poor student enrolled.
The unions claim, among other things, that the principals of the secondary schools may have been confused by the way the document authorizing the dismissal of the parent coordinators was written.
The document used the word 'excess' to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to a database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were laid off", the complaint states, "and not merely moved to the database as available staff".
Mission accomplished, Congress is ready to adopt a deal on the situation in Libya.
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are coming to an agreement on something regarding the uprising in Libya.
But before that could happen, the revolution had to succeed, longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the involvement of U.S. troops had to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will decide on a statement endorsed by Chairman John Kerry, along with Senators John McCain, and Lieberman, congratulating the Libyans on their successful uprising and thanking U.S. troops for their "bravery".
"We want to make this statement to acknowledge the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts".
The above sentences may seem innocent, but no debate involving Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both parties have been constantly arguing with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of statements approving or rejecting the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House because of differences between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the House rejected this proposal, the House also rejected a measure that would have stopped funding US operations in Libya.
This put the US mission in Libya in a legislative purge - Congress criticized the way President Obama was running the mission, but his staff apparently weren't so irritated that they stopped supporting him.
The hesitancy of the Congress was eventually preceded by further events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and on October 20th, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations issued a statement 'congratulating the people of Libya on their immense courage and admirable resilience in their efforts to liberate their people' and 'commending the extraordinary bravery and professionalism of the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies who have participated in the operation to protect the Libyan people.'
The statement also 'confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya'.
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the International Relations Commission, or will the legislators be split again in two halves, as they were when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the top Republican on the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday he hasn't seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
The House is scheduled to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, sponsored by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution to address a budget or other issue to be voted upon by the full House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to push their proposals through to the vote itself, despite considerable effort.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that have been introduced in Congress, and they cover a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented to the House and the Senate - and some are just minor variations on others.
In the House alone, you can find at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendment and a handful of others that would like to "regulate federal spending".
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents - especially budding Republicans who want to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authorship".
The decree on budgetary regulation, which was approved in August, required the amendment on the balanced budget to be voted by both the House and the Senate.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of terms Congressmen can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms a president can serve.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (Ill.) proposed a number of amendments that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage and the amendment banning burning the national flag remain a permanent proposal.
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
While members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing the various amendments, they are not significantly out of the box compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress, 77 amendments were proposed, while in the 100th Congress, 66 were proposed.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990's, when, according to statistics from the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not much more successful than today's politicians.
The last amendment that was added -- the 27th amendment -- was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated", says Gifford in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after being shot at close range at a public voter rally in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords, Arizona, appeared on national television Monday night, singing along to the tune of the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow", and declared that she wanted more than a return to Congress to heal.
Giffords appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, and it was obvious that she was still having trouble forming sentences and needed help walking.
The entire program documented her difficult recovery, necessitated by a bullet wound that pierced the front of her skull, penetrated the left half of her brain, and came out of the back of her head.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate in a triumphant vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied: "Pretty good".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on "20/20", which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The Special has been following Gifford's entire recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
The videos Kelly made during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with her head shaved and a long scar all over her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do much more than lift a finger or two.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
A nod.
Lip rinsing.
And then, her first word, "What".
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" - when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
The videos aired on ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman sings along with her therapist to the tunes of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, revealed to Sawyer that she has no memory of the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford had been reading the newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the sixth woman who was killed in the incident was.
The suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison under the influence of a lethal drug while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Wicked, wicked, wicked".
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point during his convalescence, his wife declared, "I lost".
"So I said to her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you're gonna make it, you're gonna pull yourself together, and you're gonna come back stronger than you ever were".
Military units are met with more compassion than respect
The event was a gala dinner on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines gathered around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose and cheered.
"The men and women who served in the military were considered heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
The ceremony was attended by the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units in a somewhat different light.
"They were all introduced as some kind of orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you did.
But what I saw was not respect, it was pity.
Such starkly opposite impressions only illustrate the delicate relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes celebratory American public.
The army is overwhelmed with praise for its sacrifices.
But the praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for the uniformed individuals.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon to leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls".
This is a very sensitive subject for military commanders who don't want to look ungrateful or ruin their relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops once faced on their return from Vietnam was far worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken quietly and privately among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat duty as Marines, their father warned them that their service would be viewed with double standards by outsiders.
Some will look on with awe and awe, for they have defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will wonder if "under the surface there is an evil, violent veteran", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to Washington to take a seat in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him were quietly suggesting that so soon after returning from the war, he could withstand the stresses that come with working in Washington.
"When you talk about your ministry, you must expect negative reactions", Cancian instructed his sons.
The Army's concern stems in part from American indifference to war.
Achievements on the battlefield rarely receive recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own military and little benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism as we did in World War II", declared Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition from politicians and the public has focused on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, it will be decided whether to prosecute 28 men and women against the military for alleged inaction in a rape case.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are ready to sue.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by a fellow soldier, and 11 weeks pregnant.
It was October of 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego, and after dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a case of 12 beers.
He asked if he could join her, if they could have a drink in her room.
"A warning light flashed in my head", Lyman described.
But the native Texan ignored her objections completely.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"She's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts".
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, a man walked up to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former members of the military will await the verdict of a potentially historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to determine whether charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which violates the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment, filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, of 17 plaintiffs, grew to 28-25 women and three men over the following months, all of whom allege that they were raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military and that the military failed to investigate, punish or seek justice after the reports of the attacks.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking military commanders because it starts with them.
"The army is a directive system", he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to implement measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Rather than lump all the charges into this one case - putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she will file multiple lawsuits if necessary to keep the pressure on.
The defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense's strategy - essentially that current or former service members cannot sue the military for injuries sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court ruling known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the plaintiffs' military service", the document states.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950's.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in combat, this is just a rhetorical ploy: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's teams have played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died in these wars - two thirds of them directly in the field.
It is time to modernize the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and there are three other lawyers on the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a Veterans Legal Services seminar are preparing to sue four major military academies for allegedly fostering an atmosphere of misogyny.
Independently, the nonprofit organization of American Vietnam Veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military, which focuses on diagnosing "personality disorder" that was allegedly found in rape victims to give the military a pretext to release them - a practice activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group Service Women's Action Network say is commonplace.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the state-run Veterans Affairs organization in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in handling requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted while on duty.
Nine separate motions were introduced in Congress by a group of senators and lawmakers from both political parties, proposing a number of remedies.
According to the Department of Defense Office of Sexual Violence Prevention and Response, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack goes largely unreported, and the Pentagon's own estimates put that number at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also discusses the prosecution rate of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial - half the rate in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Agent Burke's case describe the attacks as just the first of a series of trauma.
For example, Private First Class Lyman reported an alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine rape, and the blood of her attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she inflicted on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was asked in court whether she had been having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were called to testify as reputation witnesses in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Lyman.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming".
"I was placed in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'This wasn't his trial.
The Lymans ordered her to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged from the army and therefore not eligible for military service.
Whether or not Lyman and the other plaintiffs move on to the next phase is a long shot, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next phase of negotiations".
But between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since it first saw the light of day.
I myself have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because their duties don't provide the same level of incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are stacked against them... but it's important for them to try".
Change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not decide in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people willing to sue and begin working on other cases related to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, where reform will not come", he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists study you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing spree that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on his computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy - just go to Facebook.
"We've realised that getting them is not really that hard", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The Facebook database of personal information is so extensive, Bartlett says, that researchers simply used the site's advertising to pinpoint the demographic they were looking for with absolute accuracy - something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, and they targeted them and sent them ads, but instead of inviting them to join newly formed groups or offering them diet products, they asked them to fill out a questionnaire that asked questions about their education level, their attitude to violence and their optimism about their own future.
Using Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever leaving their offices.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, dismayed by the rising rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, more democratic and less violent than those who remain hidden behind a computer screen".
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and policy researchers use these sites to study everything from health issues to hidden social trends to status updates, wall posts and "like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users, each providing an average of three different pieces of data per day, making the social network an "information supernova" that is behind many new research projects.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the ability to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"It used to be that if you wanted to do a poll of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You have to get to a side where they'd never let you in", says Bartlett.
"Facebook is breaking down all of that - you just go right to them".
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a public health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that college students who shared their drinking habits on Facebook were at a much higher risk of developing alcoholism than students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moren suggests that students' peers monitor the site and come forward with an offer of help to a student who posts too many drunken status updates.
"You can't fix a problem if you can't diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morenova's study and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify vulnerable children we otherwise wouldn't have a chance to find".
Facebook itself is constantly probing its users' data.
The site's information team compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010, and the nation's satisfaction ratio (mostly using information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasury available for research by others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, they have to give the site their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clear rules about how to collect data offline, but online data is available to everyone.
"I don't think most users even thought that scientists could look at their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they thought that information was only between them and their friends".
The question of methodology is also to be considered next.
Even when you do research offline, there's no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There's no way to verify how much of the information on the Facebook profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, feels that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tools to use in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's irreplaceable", he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activity -- and a hell of a lot of social activity still happens offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar", he told a court of 500 people.
"I object to the court's order because you were appointed by organizations that promote hate ideology and because it promotes multiculturalism".
"I admit my actions, but I admit no guilt".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which to present his views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from any contact with the media for four weeks, and announced that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept under lock and key.
All of them participated in order to move the case to a close.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman", one survivor told NRK.
"It was not pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I was mentally moved a little further".
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, entering and leaving the building without difficulty, looking into the eyes of the journalists present and the survivors.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge found that he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
For some, it may be a comfort to know that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that still linger in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but she doesn't", said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be so much easier".
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie coming out this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, opinions began to emerge that compared him to Henry Ford - and elected him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
In the recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was dusted for a special movie that's heading to theaters this week, it will be for all Apple fans to know that his creative mind was perfectly aware of the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was a brilliant designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a man who took every little thing to the last detail - believing that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work . . . [but] there is still a long way to go between a great idea and a great finished product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was working on the TV show Triumph of the Computer Crazies, which was about the dawn of personal computers.
By this time, it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company NeXT, and he was eager to see the Internet embraced by the general public.
The TV show ended up using only a brief portion of the entire interview with Cringely, and original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transit.
However, shortly after Jobs' death, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This is the footage, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which will be released in select theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who's notoriously reluctant to give long interviews, here Jobs seems surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, there's a long pause between the question and the answer -- 10 to 15 seconds of thought, where you see how Jobs thinks his answer through perfectly to be as relevant and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, when he acts impatient when Cringley asks questions, and rushes him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and it contains some frighteningly prophetic thoughts as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and badly, while offering his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read a posthumous review of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as a passionate dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
Before long, after he had expressed his ideas, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"In my years in business, I've always asked, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer has always been the same, 'Well, that's just the way it is.'"
No one knows why they do what they do, they never think deeply about business matters.
I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way costs were recorded - they often started with "standard costs", which he could only guess at, and at that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automated tool that guaranteed that they could determine business costs in an instant.
How he did the Pope's spanking:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak -- a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
There's been a lot written about this device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and had it beamed from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've been around the world like this at least half a dozen times, so when we shouted something into the pay phone, it rang a minute later from the other phone at the door", Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we realized that we could build ourselves something that could run a billion-dollar infrastructure around the world".
The two of us built a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would have ever been created without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a joke that he and Wozniak almost made, where they called the Vatican in the middle of the night using a Blue Box and asked if they could speak to the Pope, posing as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, more and more high-ranking members of the Catholic Church were called in to speak with the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the pope himself was awakened to the phone, the couple chuckled and hung up.
How he fell in love with technology (and talked to Bill Hewlett on the phone):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a meter, he found a number in the phone book for Bill Hewlett and called him.
Within 20 minutes of their conversation, Jobs had secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was an incredible influence on me, it was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with it instantly.
As a teenager at HP, I was moving up the ranks, hanging around this computer and writing programs for it.
How he invents innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about how he's inventing new products while running.
Early in his career, when he was selling some circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble an entire computer for him.
He had only 30 days of paid time to design, assemble and deliver the finished device.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced developing the computer mouse:
"I remember we were having a pretty heated argument. They were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a $300 mouse], and I stopped having fun, so I went out and found a designer".
And 90 days later, we were able to build a perfectly reliable mouse for $15 dollars.
How big companies are running out of breath:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs presciently predicted that many industry leaders would falter in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be a more successful company.
At that point, sales and marketing are in the air, so companies are run by people who are in charge of that, while people who are in charge of their own products are left out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius who led society to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could be 10 times bigger than it is, it could be Microsoft in the '90s...
But instead of winning, they lost.
How he sees innovation as an art form:
"There's a long way to go and a lot of work to do between a great idea and a great finished product... and as that great idea evolves, it changes and grows".
You'll learn a lot about him in the meantime.
You have to make a lot of compromises -- some things you can't just make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your head at all times -- different concepts -- and put them together...
It's ultimately about taste -- you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and you kind of try to project them into what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The reason the Macintosh company was so amazing and successful was because the people who worked on it were great musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and, incidentally, also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be doing amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dining with health care opponents while their case was in court
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to consider the politically contentious question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will be sitting in the courtroom.
The incident occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the motions.
One of the cases we discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care that Congress passed last year - a law that has mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the case, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, and the outcome will further fuel the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing when the decision is made.
The lawyer who will appear in court and try to get the law struck down will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which huge sums of money are at stake in the case.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court hearing on the case.
Among those present was Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a staunch opponent of the Affordable Care Act.
And the introduction of the guests?
This is nothing new: these two judges have been participating in Federalist Society events for years.
And it's certainly not anything that violates ethics.
In effect, these judges are exempt from the code of conduct that applies to lower federal judges.
If this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under Principle C4, which states that 'a judge may participate in events organised by related and other organisations for the purpose of raising funds, but he may not be a speaker, guest of honour or be featured on the programme of events.'
Yet Scalia and Thomas' relationship to the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the companies with a huge financial stake in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and disregard for the code of conduct contradicts several judges' claims that the Supreme Court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges have been drinking and dining at a benefit with lawyers awaiting trial".
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this event undermines all claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics, telling them that they too had no problem combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
And the conservatives argue that the ethical issue is with Justice Elena Kagan, not with Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law came before the court.
Kagan's critics are pressing her to drop the case, claiming she fought for the law too hard to be unbiased now.
Kagan has not indicated that she's going to resign.
Boeing has won a record $ 18 billion jet contract
Emirates Airlines has placed an order for 50 two-lane jetliners of the Boeing 777 family with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it collects over USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of their products, it's usually no cause for celebration.
But if that company is the Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 planes is a record $18 billion, that's another story.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the contract from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest ever order for a commercial airliner at the weekend, in terms of dollar value, 50 two-lane jetliners.
The sensational order came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airlines have the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to USD 26 billion.
Then on Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes called Dreamliners, which boast significantly improved fuel efficiency and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft is over $1 billion.
"This is excellent news for Boeing as a whole", said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high".
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing nations.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in fuel prices - usually hurting the airlines because it's one of their biggest costs - is not as decisive because the country itself is profiting from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to higher fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection", he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeing's leading position in the wide-body market and puts Airbus SAS at a disadvantage as it sought to challenge Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest aircraft, the A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be postponed.
The reason for the delay was that customers demanded a higher payload and range, so the manufacturer took time to provide more engine power.
The share price of Boeing Co increased by 1.5% to USD 67,94.
The president 's sister seems to have lost the election in Michoacan .
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of the PRI, was helped by drug traffickers in his quest for the governorship.
Felipe Calderona's sister, who appeared to have lost a violent statewide election for governor in Michoacan, later claimed on Monday that drug traffickers helped one of her opponents win.
Preliminary results have awarded the leadership in the Western State governorship election to Faust Vallej of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interference of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the course of yesterday's elections is alarming not only for Michoacán but for our entire country", Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of our polling group... they confiscated the ballot boxes, they put up roadblocks... and they made people vote on the order of the PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
However, he plans to return to power soon, and winning the election in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems Vallejo beat Calderon, who was leading the day before the election, by a very narrow margin.
Calderon, the candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejón as the winner.
In third place is Silvano Aureolis, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has so far held the governorship, a very unfortunate defeat for a fractious and ill-fated party ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, rejects any ties to drug traffickers and urges other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military campaign against smugglers in December 2006.
But the violence continued.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderón, was assassinated just a week before the election and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
But whatever the results of the Michoacan election look like for the PRI, a victory for the party will help to give it a new impetus.
The PRI's expected presidential candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto, of Washington congratulated Vallej, saying: "I think this victory could be very encouraging for the year ahead".
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help bail out the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise an overall global economic downturn could ensue, with a negative impact on growth in Asia as well.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said that the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all of Europe's troubles "too unconcernedly", and said that Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and resources, would help avert a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is certainly not immune".
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it".
The European Monetary Union has been severely tested by a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge for the emerging leading economies to come together and help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, the European institution for financial stability - would provide greater bargaining power for Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and a drying of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unrestful", he said.
"We are faced with a difficult task and we must maintain a high growth rate".
"This is not an alternative, this is a fact, because otherwise we would not be able to find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women".
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India's, have little to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to India's 1.2 billion people, 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they might find that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy beach holidays, which they would find hard to explain", he noted.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian reserves should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis was threatened by a 'dangerous domino effect'.
The Bank's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 now faces a "downside risk" due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must develop "unpredictable spending plans" to protect themselves from a downturn and a significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon warns of possible defense cuts
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has given Congress a big push on Monday when he warned that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefields of Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next decade, but now it fears another $600 billion if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the entire department", Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to agree on a budget and the resulting so-called moratorium would cause a 23% flat rate cut and halt many new projects.
"Because of such a huge cut, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our shipbuilding or ship projects - you cannot buy only three-quarters of the buildings or ships.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will almost certainly also have to put civilians on forced leave to be able to meet target requirements".
"These changes could shake the faith of those who care for our military and seriously damage its readiness".
Eventually, the cuts will affect combat troops, Panetta said.
"While the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this halt, operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets", warned Panetta.
"There will be cuts in contract personnel as well, which will result in a delay in the contractual agreements that support our people's war effort".
'The status of paid staff will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and a consequent disruption of legal and political support.'
Both senators wrote Panett back ten days ago, asking for details regarding the possible impact of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of the shutdown at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the image of the United States as a world military power".
"We are strictly against this drastic measure", the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not an agreement we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign it".
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow".
"It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and amplify calls to remove the Pentagon from the list of areas of restricted use.
Panetta has been increasingly open in recent days to talk about possible cuts, even though he himself had moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going to be in a tough fight.
At a press conference held last week, the Secretary of Defense hinted at a brief picture of what his department can expect - an army shell, but one that lacks a core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors".
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition".
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots".
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission", Panetta said at the start of his speech at the Pentagon.
"He will be like a unit with no morale, unprepared and unable to face a potential enemy".
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed... "
In an appendix to the letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significantly reduced options for landings and deployments worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could be waiting to be completed, including those already being tested and those in the early planning stages.
Among the items on the list were the F-35 project, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal warship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy wanted to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in the military upgrade needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Tell a Lie
A glance at recent headlines reveals just how prevalent and pervasive lying and deception are in our daily lives.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy with the sexual harassment allegations against several women - both sides claiming the latter is a lie.
Penn State administrators were accused of perjury when they tried to cover up a record of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught with a microphone on telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie has been able to destroy entire careers and undermine the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing campaign funds to try to cover up his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that swept Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual attraction to Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories of cheating in schools and colleges all over the place.
There are instances when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their own assessments.
Mentors who are supposed to teach the opposite send a message that lying and deceit are acceptable.
How many scams do we see?
Studies show that you lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times in a single day.
Let's assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study found that strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting someone.
Lying detection, or "discovery of lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it's not a social game that's like, say, a charade where you yell, "I've got you". Deception recognition is a serious branch of science that works with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities through detailed research projects, especially in psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're just hanging out, or cocktailing, or blushing, or flirting.
Do not conclude, however, that it is somehow difficult to spot and detect a liar.
A trained lie detector can detect truth from sentence structure, tiny facial expressions, the way questions are formulated and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from the vast and growing field of lie detection, and it is clear that lie detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating, or managing people.
Good liars are also good at reading others, letting them soak in their alertness, directing their emotions, and intuitively sensing how the other party is receiving them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more "personal" lies - mostly to protect one's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than single people (but the lies they tell are usually "disgraceful").
We also know that if you're perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know when someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's normal behavior.
It's called "initial observation".
It will give him something to compare his findings with later.
Notice the subject's body posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is a regular foot-tapping person so that you do not falsely accuse him of lying just because he starts tapping his feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But consider it only as a warning sign, not as proof of a lie.
People who tell lies may stop moving their upper half when trying to remember their fictional story, may turn their shoe to the door, lean out, change their posture dramatically, or show "relief at the end of the conversation" - excessively relaxed breathing and changing position when confession is difficult.
Interviewers often give the false signal that the interview is over, just to see what relief will be like when it's over.
Also, notice the language of the subject.
There's a famous story about how Scott Peterson once mispronounced and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which sparked a nationwide search for her body.
Lying individuals may also say in moderation, "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal signs are very subtle.
Someone may use a lot of "mild language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... as I know... to the best of my knowledge".
Such a response may not reveal much of the facts, and it is often just another warning sign.
There is no magic to uncover every lie, but you can learn the skills to detect a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of avoiding being exposed to a liar and a cheat in his personal and professional life.
A controversial oil pipeline project is to be diverted after the threat of delayed U.S. government approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - turning unions against each other but reassuring environmentalists - the company in charge of building the pipeline announced it was willing to re-route the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it would move a planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Government Headquarters.
TransCanada's Alex Pourbax claims that the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
This announcement comes after the State Department announced last week that it was delaying a decision on federal permits for the project, from which it would conduct a study of possible alternate routes that would avoid impacting the Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is a real step forward", Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment ordered by the State Department would likely delay any decision until 2013, a year after next year's election, but officials deny any political role in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support.
A 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
It carries 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This is a six-state road.
The project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but loved by the work crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created by working on the pipeline.
However, legislators in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered legislation to force the company to withhold access to the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the inspector general from the State Department had ordered a review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
One was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, had a conflict of interest in the program.
Another was whether the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not selected inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making a toddler throw up in fear.
A New York family says singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter so badly that she threw up in fear.
The performance of the hit singer "Lady Marmalade" so frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family claims in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Superior Court.
On November 10th of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car in, Roseanna Monk gathered her luggage down to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard home, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'You know what your daughter's doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and I went to pick her up".
LaBelle was giving a furious scolding to the pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said, 'You shouldn't put your daughter by the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
I said, "I don't care what you think".
She became angry and began to speak obscenely - shouting out the simplest of expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her and started spitting water at me.
He says Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter.'"
LaBelle threw herself at her mother, who was still holding Genevieve, and was stopped by her escort, who then dragged her to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so loudly she threw up, adding.
Later, the family sent a letter to LaBelle apologizing, but they received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokeswoman are not responding to our calls for comment on the case.
The lawsuit seeks undisclosed damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all proceeds to a charity for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions", Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when directed at a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child".
The economic slowdown caused by the unfavorable climate
During the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment declined and with it the economy
The year 2011 will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as the first year of the self-styled government of change, led by Maria López Valdez, which brought with it high expectations for economic progress, but due to unfavourable climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth was recorded and even major indicators of economic development declined.
The low temperatures in February have caused millions of agricultural losses, limited the growth of the national economy, and led to a 3.6% decline in economic activity in the first half of this year, with agriculture falling by a historic 31.16%, which has also affected other economic sectors.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of cultivated land were damaged, of which 78,03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21,07% were partially damaged.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a steady increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state's unemployment rate recorded an increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents were unemployed in Sinaloa, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment rate continued to rise, reaching a value of 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the measures that have been implemented at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is linked to a variety of factors, including a loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation passed by Congress to combat money laundering, and it is not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn, invest or use them", he said.
Stop the migration
López Cervantes said that demographics also contributed to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work in the United States has decreased, partly because of the difficulty of entry and partly because even if these people get across the border, it is difficult for them to find work.
Unreliable
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also worsened by the growing unreliability prevailing in the area of working conditions.
In addition to unemployment and unreliability, there are other labour market features such as low wages.The administrative territory has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa State was 5,352 pesos as of September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, 2011 also saw the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years.According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment in the period from January to June amounted to USD 630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to USD 5,143,312 in the same period of the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government reports investments of PTE 17 280 million per year, mainly in service enterprises.
Other liabilities
In July, the state government requested the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. As of November, no gains from debt had been recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to business representatives, the first year of the government of Maria López Valdés showed the lack of management skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformative Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination between the will of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The economic development in Sinaloa has been really small this year. We have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, there was a lack of coordination of our efforts and especially the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better", he said.
The slowdown in the economy
Loredo López said events like frost at the beginning of the year have halted the state's economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic performance was caused by a number of events, including freezes.One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to regain momentum to achieve acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
The Work Ahead
Coparmex's chairman stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there has been some progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term plan", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy management.
"There are elements to say that the government is trying to be friendly, I can say that the work has been done and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead", he said.
Convicted of 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of probation for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a patrol on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in the El Castillo district of Navolato.
The dealer was driving a white pickup truck, had a black bag in the back of the car, a small backpack in the passenger seat, and the soldiers found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the man in custody remains at the disposal of the Second Chamber Judge and the proceedings remain internal to the Centre for the Implementation of Criminal Law.
Owes contributions to projects
Social projects, such as Habitat, Rescue Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, are at risk of not being completed or of being delayed by lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that while construction has progressed so far, the state government now risks not being able to provide the necessary supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, with the state accounting for 25 percent.
"They are to provide almost 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not received anything at all, even though we should have received some in July", he said.
He said that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state failed to meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan to repay the more than 7 million that the government did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went ahead.
Despite the promise of the State authorities to transfer these resources, he said that a request had been sent to Armando Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance, to expedite the procedure and that the corresponding percentage had arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't received a single peso yet".
The Court approves the "end of analogue broadcasting in Mexico in 2015"
The replacement of analogue signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) has rejected a constitutional lawsuit brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against a presidential decree that seeks to speed up the so-called "turning off of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the court's president, Juana Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not overstep his authority when he issued a decree outlining the steps leading to the transition to digital terrestrial television.
The action brought by the Senate was therefore dismissed on the ground that the qualified majority of eight votes required for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree was not obtained, and that the decree thus remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported a constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight the decree.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal that the federal executive cannot structure measures to prepare the public administration through general standards.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority", he said, noting that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years, related to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would be to delay the benefits of digitalisation, which requires decisions in the public interest, as digitalisation is not only technical but also "touches on economic, social, political and national security issues".
He stressed that these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the digital switchover, and did so through their governments, despite having highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He argued that it was impossible for the government to enforce the laws of the legislature in the administration by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interfered with the powers of Congress.
In Michoacán, they're analyzing the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to the PREP data, the difference between first and second place in the governor's race is less than 27 percent.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" appeared in this year's election in Michoacán, where according to data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and that is without counting 879 votes out of a total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a series of measures to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially ratified its political constitution, nor its State Electoral Code or Electoral Justice Act, as the state congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish them within the deadline set in the Official Gazette Law, saying he had some objections to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature, declaring the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "null and void" because he has no right "to approve or veto them".
When asked about the possibility of a vote-by-vote count, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for both the partial and the total count to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral parcels, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results are not in agreement; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or it is not available to the President concerned; or there have been errors and manifest irregularities in the election results.
In addition, the total vote count at all polling stations will be possible if there is evidence that the difference between the potential winner and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The total vote will also be counted if, after a proper count, the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and whenever there is an express request from the political party whose candidate finished second, in which case the partially counted ballots will be discarded.
It should be noted that this is the situation in Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is less than 0,16%, although 129 of the 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname Mountains, family confirmed.
The remains of Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported to his hometown of Saltillo on Sunday night for a solemn ceremony and a funeral mass on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname mountains.
After receiving the highest honors, along with the other victims of the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane, where they and their closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the colonel's ashes were brought to the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Street, where family and friends gathered.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell party was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the football team, of which Felipe Bacio was a member during his senior year.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinama mountains, as he always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She said the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his game, "a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother who lived for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo at a very young age and enrolled in the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he had barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his uncle's graduation, so he believes he died doing what he loved most in life - flying an airplane.
They gave him his final farewell
Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, and I said goodbye to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the officials and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, where he graduated in 1985 and where he excelled in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died in a helicopter crash a few days ago, along with Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all state officials.
At 18:05 the remains of Bacio Cortese, a native of Saltillo, arrived (cremated) to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force through a funeral service led by Major Jaime Martinez, where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three abandoned bodies were found at Caderey's NL estate.
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 individuals who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men, shot in different parts of the body and head, were found on an abandoned property in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery was made a mile down the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved about in these places noticed that the beige-coffee-fenced hut had an occasional open door.
When they looked inside, about ten feet [3 m] away, they saw three dead bodies and immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the subjects was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants, not a shoe, and next to him was a man also wearing a white striped sports shirt.
A few feet away, the body of another man dressed in a red sweatshirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them were lying face down.
Based on the data we got from the scene, all three people were probably killed at another location because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the cabin, messages were found addressed by one organized crime group to another, as well as a number of bullet marks on both the building and the door.
11 suspects have been arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence has identified 11 individuals, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and is linked to kidnappings, murders, stalking and illegal burials.
According to the information published, during the first attempt on November 11th, eight people were detained in the Los Alveros colony and one detainee was freed.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and they confirmed they were members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another raid occurred at 6am on November 12th, when military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they noticed a car with no license plate and two people inside.
After the car was stopped, they searched the premises and found one rifle, a magazine, and 18 rounds.
Then, based on these statements, one of the accomplices was arrested on November 13th at around 2pm in the area of La Frauda.
They were accused of illegal burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that is keeping the country above the brink of economic catastrophe.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that has kept the country above the brink of economic catastrophe and has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The presidential palace issued a statement saying that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form a government.
He is expected to introduce a government made up of mostly technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in an attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to get through this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were being overcome.
"The framework is now well defined", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less time than usual, while Italy struggles to fight a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough package of austerity measures demanded by European leaders, the only way to restore Italy's shattered credibility.
Monti is under intense pressure to hurry up, as market instability has pushed the interest rate on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above the 7% mark, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to seek bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Confindustria, the Italian employers' organisation, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government".
We believe this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this critical situation.
Monti's hopes for success have been greatly boosted by the support of the PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to produce good results", Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because up to this point, a number of its members had opposed the government with a technocratic majority, which Monti is forming.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to push through unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could spell disaster.
Monti opened talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations.
The round of negotiations will end Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, which allowed for very rapid progress in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline late last week when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond yields have returned to critical levels in response to uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti has said his government should remain in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will give him time only to implement reforms, and then call early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed of only experts to get Italy out of the difficulties it has run into due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicated the attempt to include both political figures in the government.
Spaniards attend international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Ten of the 22 Spanish footballers will cross the 50 international match mark.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players called up reached the 50-match mark.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare the 22 players from both countries who met today in a friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the World and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a wide range of A-League inter-conference matches to their credit, Costa Rica only have defender Michael Uman, who is the only player to have played 50 international matches.
He achieved this number last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star game and in the powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain an intense activity throughout the year in league and domestic cup competitions and high-level European cup competitions such as the Champions League.
We must also add to this the experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated qualifying matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities to play abroad in the region.
We see that the most international appearances of the Spanish national team have in their account the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (losing 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international appearances.
Casillas will play against Costa Rica again today, setting a new record for Spain with 127 international appearances.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona's key player, has 106 games to his name.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have 100 games to their name, including the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke midfielder Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol is close to a century with 97 games.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with [Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Uman, left wing Junior Díaz moves to 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz to 45.
Only five have crossed the 30-match mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least number of matches.
With less than 30 caps in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are among the most capped players in the history of the Spanish league.
On the national side with less than 30 games, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't even make it past 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most goals, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet has included the country in their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary.
"A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to play one of their best shows at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We've been waiting for over 20 years, but the band itself says that for them, the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
So said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The band is on the South American continent as part of their 20th anniversary tour and will make a unique stopover in Central America on Sunday the 20th.
He's performing at the National Stadium this evening at 7:30 with the angelic band The X and the folk musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview, which you can find in full on La Nación's website.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true, Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica.
A trip to Costa Rica is also our dream come true.
This is only our second time in South and Central America, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, and it's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we're very excited to bring you our music.
I ask because the band is literally adored here, and the fans are having these days of preparation very intense.
What do you say to your most ardent supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and we thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the greatest shows we've put on in the last 21 years were created in a matter of weeks.
We did some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we're hoping that's what's gonna get us in shape for the Costa Rica show.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle, and for both of those things, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, and these are the best places to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica from people who love surfing.
Looking back on your tour, you put on a great show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can do.
We're gonna try to put on the best variety show we can, try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good, diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think part of it's because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to pick which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about them.
It makes the show more interesting for us, and I think that's why it's more interesting for people.
This tour is to celebrate 20 years of your artistic career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure you do.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined being in a big rock band and staying in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we've been given and we're moved that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be able to see the places we've always wanted to see.
We couldn't have ended up better.
What did it mean to you to be a major part of the birth of the grunge genre?
We've always been honored to be part of this group of great people.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement starts out with a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
Occasionally a group will be formed in a town, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to appear in one town at a time.
We're proud and honored to be part of a Seattle band.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, and we're lucky to have all these friends and we're honored to be part of this movement that started in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a lot longer than the usual band length.
I think, first, we're all lucky to still be in this world, and second, it's partly because we're constantly interested in each other.
We're all close friends, and because of that, we've been able to open up musical paths that allow everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we respect each other's music, and I think it couldn't get any better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but your success allows you to do whatever you like.
How do you find the balance?
As we grew older, it became easier and easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came here for the music, you remember that you have to respect the music and what you've given it, and you can't get carried away by being famous, rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and it was something great at first.
We were in the band for three years and never released an album until after Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long, and the most important thing is that even today, we're still friends with Bruce and Greg who started out in the band with us, and when I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy, how amazing he was, how I laughed with him, and it was always a joy to work with him, laugh with him, talk about music or football and so much more.
She was an incredible person and we miss her very much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as your forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with some suggestions, and we liked this band the best, so we were curious to see what Las Robertas had to offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who's your bass player?
A lot of people.
The first people to attack me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them, I could talk all night about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge going even though it's out of fashion?
I think we've all always felt a little detached from the word grunge.
When I think of grunge, I think of the bands I've mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out around the same time, and if music is still relevant today, that's great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music than ever before.
At first, your music was a little somber, but now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there are a couple of songs on the new album that are a little bit more light-hearted, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very bleak, although they can sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and you have a trauma in your life, you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs to me are just that.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized at a public hospital on Tuesday for tests for muscle loss in his lower extremities, his attending physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four operations and is currently under medical control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days to determine why he is in pain and losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that he thought Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, but the former president himself does not want to be pardoned because he feels innocent.
He had four operations for tongue cancer, lost 60 pounds [18 kg], and had other ailments, including severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by an army killing squad operating illegally in the first years of his rule.
Musician on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to seek to expand trade between the two nations and to discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday, the first meeting of a major visit to Mexico by political, business and Uruguayan community leaders, the program was announced by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries", the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to back Uruguay in a dispute with France that has erupted after French President Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to expel countries that continued to be tax havens from the international community, a statement that drew a negative response from Uruguay and consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been the chair of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries, and has signed an information-sharing agreement with the Latin American country to prevent double taxation since January this year.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been working to concretise fiscal exchange agreements in order to get off the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 'blacklist' of countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The bearded installer runs in 3D thanks to Super Mario 3D Land
For over 25 years, Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D before: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores around the world this month, was designed from the ground up to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play 3D games without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell stereoscopy how to work without glasses", said Nintendo of Spain press officer Omar Álvarez during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium", because up to that point successful films like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson stated that in addition to being 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and smooth gameplay experience.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you've passed this level, you can proceed to the "second round" of the game, which is more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose between real-time "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This new arrival of Super Maria in 3D also includes a return to the handheld console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the tune of those who follow the saga, repeating the successful formula of the previous installments, which is that the bearded man's plumber will have to go through dangerous minefields to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new moves, surroundings, disguises and even among enemies, a "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom has approved Portilla's extradition to the United States.
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has moved forward with the extradition of former President Alfonso Portilla, who is being held in the United States on charges of conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This concludes a process that was intended to allow Guatemala to respond to a request by a northern country to extradite Portilla to stand trial.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He has assured that he has not "interfered" in court decisions during his term and has authorised all extraditions that have come to his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and aggravated assault and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colomo's move marks the execution step after all judicial and constitutional means were exhausted to prosecute the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process that preceded extradition, but the State Department appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youths
The organization was founded to help children without education not to be left on the margins of society.
The first 25 years of existence of Trinijove Social Support Organisation are very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion were helped.
This is in addition to the well over 100 jobs created for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet in a ceremony at the former Fabra i Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was established in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, unemployment, drug addiction or at risk of social exclusion.
The meeting yesterday in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujo, the former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Ecosocialist Councillor Ricard Goma attended the ceremony.
The current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the Fabra i Coats Grand Hall.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that today's times also have a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has done to date "is a good foundation".
The President cited Trinijov as an example of how to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organisation and the work it does", he said.
There was an eviction of a foreclosed house where huge parties were being held.
The intruders have taken 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51.
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbours of 51 Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying yesterday at noon, where they were throwing a huge party that woke up the neighbors, leaving the building by court order and without the need for police intervention.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repeat.
"From this moment on, the entrance will be guarded", declared the warden.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are residential - took away all electrical and some water supplies, painted the walls, and left behind trash of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties were held that lasted for up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
There's a disco next to the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales had fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club claims that the occupants of the building were unfairly competing with her, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, whereas the disco costs 10.
The owner of the entertainment business also had to respond to complaints from neighbors about noise, but the problem was not with the visitors to the club, but with the residents of the house, especially those who attended the parties, which have increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry residents.
The owner of the club explained that the problems were so great that she even made an agreement with the building owner to waive her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they have received several complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the city's PP group in the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately evacuated and thus end the problems of civic coexistence that the neighbors are suffering and the destruction of the area".
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had gotten into all floors of the building and almost all apartments and even robbed one of them.
In this regard, he added that "impunity must be ended and the actions against civil responsibility that have taken place in the building must be taken with consistency".
Yesterday, city police also cleared a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at building 35 on Rue de Montréal after being called by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
The architects have come together to write a lawsuit that involves more than a fee controversy.
The municipal tender for 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park in metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona, as the Catalan capital is one of the few that does not orient on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the wild boar instead of Yogi the Bear.
This was the position until September, when the city council announced a mega competition of 16 entries for the same number of entrances to Collserola.
The gate, of course, is more of a recording of the idea of a park.
Either that, or someone's trying to put a gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organisational point of view and from a reflection on the city, this question becomes a central theme for all Barcelona architects.
It's as old-fashioned as when two members of this ancient caste, chosen at a meeting in an elevator, shake hands.
And it was this act that produced one of the rare coincidences between the thinking of three Barcelona architects and a prominent university professor.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is justified.
According to Roldan, once the question of the Gulf side was raised, the 'mountain side' 'must' be discussed as well, so that Ildefons Cerda's speech on green apples was not completed.
"We must assume that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the name 'Gates to Collserola' is a 'lexicological trap': we must not think of them 'as entrances to the park, but rather as the demarcation of zones where it is possible to act'.
Modol, like Roldan and Bayonne, with experience in the world of urban planning, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty that the public space project presents today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had its swan song in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step", which is basically to go one step further.
"The new urban planning and planning tools must be kept in mind, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)) can cause a real disaster".
In a more detailed analysis, Modol considers that the Collserola valley slope can be 'considered a park' but the Barcelona area cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there was already work done by the Patronat de Collserola which 'must not end up in the garbage', although he welcomed the fact that the town hall offered his board to intervene in the project 'from the first moment'.
He also understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of loophole that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should be just tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the game its name is complex because the tender documents lack Collserola's global vision: "16 tenders have been announced covering the whole mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at and understands the area as a whole".
That makes him, at least, the one who signed up for all 16 auditions.
Otherwise, the design of one gate may conflict with the architect's concept and definition of the adjacent gate.
In his view, the town hall should ensure that the zone immediately above the Ronda de Dalt is provided with facilities along its entire length to ensure a smooth transition between the town and the green.
The casino has pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days in custody, legal representative Cadino Red granted clemency to the mayor's brother in a trial where he was being prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after Casino Red's legal representative granted him a pardon at the Second Criminal Court in the district, which was hearing a blackmail case in which the mayor's brother was accused.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas was supposed to ask him to pay an economic quota to the Monterrey City Council to allow illegal operation of the bookmaker.
After a public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office began criminal prosecution of the mayor's brother.
Then after four hours in front of Public Prosecutor's Agent Number 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after the second arrest warrant was issued and a prosecutor's agent dismissed the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was taken to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red for one and a half million pesos, but he only spent a few hours in a medium-security prison because of death threats.
The authorities allowed him to stay in the city jail in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas' guilt, including the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino officials in exchange for a promise to allow the operation.
This Monday, the legal representative of the Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecin to ask for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he can be released soon.
During the legal proceedings, the prosecutor assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if the damages had been repaired and which of the accomplices had decided to grant clemency.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal pardon, no complaint can be filed in the proceedings against him, and no compensation or penalty can be claimed.
After a hearing with a legal representative at about 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabaal Breton.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yanéz, showed up at the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and his case was put on file.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome has provided details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) said the results of the investigation into the crash that killed the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter crashed into the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the Secretary of Communications and Transportation, said that before the plane took off, the pilot had noted that the climatic conditions of the flight allowed.
"The parts that emerge indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings tangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons and therefore met all the requirements for transporting personnel.
It further stated that, based on the investigation carried out at the impact site, no components were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that the plane's parts were not elsewhere, so the plane hit the mainland intact.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all passenger requirements.
The terrain is inclined seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at this time, it is most important to get results as quickly as possible, but the investigation could take months or even a year.
Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director general of airport and emergency services, said the helicopter was traveling at cruise speed at the time of the crash and the crash occurred on soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis that the accident was a routine flight operation", he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome outlined six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
The weather conditions:
AICM reports indicate adequate take-off conditions, according to which the aircraft is moving towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico, there were visible layers of low-level clouds.
Routes selected:
It is likely that the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility into the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Location of impact.
The crash coordinates and the helicopter's last radar record match, so it's likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of flight path prior to the crash.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information we have at this time allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The scatter plot of the plane debris indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of impact.
No fire or explosion was reported.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident to indicate that there was an explosion or fire.
The latest investigation indicates that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, aircraft debris was found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet, the terrain is steep, the slope of the slope ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage of what is believed to be a breakdown along the route.
The information provided elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have made contact with the ground at several locations.
After a thorough search of the accident site, no remains of the helicopter were found in an area larger than the designated area, which reinforces the belief that the impact occurred while the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has begun research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for child and adolescent obesity.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to identify the gene that causes obesity in children and adolescents.
In a report, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the 21st Century National Health Centre Specialist Hospital, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without permits, can also get involved in the research by visiting the participating IMSS sports centers in the Valle de México, where tests will be given to youths every Sunday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research began at Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and since October 8th, the same activity is also being carried out at Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children have been obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the components and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people and thus prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people aged between six and 14 years, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that every Saturday, all participants are given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels, and genes (an attempt to identify genes involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that the research reflects health officials' concerns about the alarming increase in childhood obesity.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was a 77% increase in obesity in boys and a 47% increase in girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight,' said an IMSS expert.
He said that one reason for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of a country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of his genetic makeup of Native Americans, 30% of European and 5% of African, reflected in the genes responsible for diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn off excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants is that they receive an overall assessment of the children's condition, which can reveal whether they are known to be overweight or obese.
He noted that even the presence of dark wrinkles (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of metabolic problems and prediabetes.
The information is confidential, and doctors give it in writing to parents, explaining all the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent their children from getting the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day, and using public transportation instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also caused by high calorie intake, i.e. higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) high in fat and protein, and genetic load, which is the subject of this research.
There will be no cracks in the asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, creates modified asphalt with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving was properly maintained, the nearly 200,000 potholes in the Valle de México Metropolitan area would not need to be repaired after each rainy season, notes Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who added that if the construction and maintenance of the paving were adequate, the potholes would be significantly reduced or even eliminated.
In his talk on the Technological Cause of Potholes, which he gave during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that his laboratory is developing modified polymer asphalt, which should produce a mixture with similar properties to asphalt but greater mechanical strength at both low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve functionality and reduce the formation of ditches.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules called asphaltenes, and low molecular weight molecules called maltenes, which together give asphalt its characteristic viscoelastic character.
The viscoelasticity of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, has a high viscosity at 120 degrees, and is almost solid at 50 degrees, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in streets is not uniform but varies during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, noted a chemical engineer.
A chemistry scientist observed that most streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible paving, made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Between the topmost layers is an asphalt veneer, made up of small pebbles that are covered in asphalt and then compacted.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the insert is covered with asphalt.
When vehicles pass by or when pressure is generated, it is possible to distribute the forces in the pavement well.
If it were modified asphalt, they would decompose even better, says a chemical engineer.
He added that the final layer, called the mantle, is made up of fine stone, or sand, also covered with asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the vehicle tyres, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt liner and must ensure friction on the road.
Since the load will be high as part of the paving, the cover must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken with the material of which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to be kept in mind.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inward and is difficult to get out, softening all layers of the pavement and creating crevices.
He explained that the first thing that happens when the cladding is damaged is the asphalt insert, which is not damaged all at once but is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first sign of damage by proper maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that vehicle loads are another important factor in the formation of pits, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must be consistent with the vehicle load and must ensure that this load is not exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that much work remains to be done on asphalt and that research is still in its infancy, such as asphalt emulsions, which are already available in other countries and allow for easy repair of cracks without the need for high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the next Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna not winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle wins her 14th title, first multi-miss.
Valle del Cauca has once again failed to reach the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with being on the podium, winning a silver crown and a scarf, making her the first new Miss Colombia.
Following the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, which was won and crowned by Miss Atlántico, the department was awarded the 14th title of first Miss Multimiss. Melina joined the ranks of Valle del Cauca women who had been close to winning the crown but were ultimately declared first Miss Multimiss. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Olga (1990), Diana Isabel Pinedo (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question that many people ask themselves.
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds has shown that she has the ability to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Face Joile de Volgue.
One of the key factors that led the jury to decide to name her only First Miss was the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What book did you like the most and why?", posed by Martin Murillo Gómez of the literary magazine Leamos.
To the question, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very strongly in the role of literature, I think it's a form of culture, and the book that influenced me most as a child was The Little Prince, a very profound book.
I'm currently reading "Crime and Punishment", a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know, and today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author, a wonderful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This answer was not liked, firstly because of the term 'culturalisation' and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned made her feel.
After the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen, will happen.
And you people, read it if you can.
Another hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who took all the previous awards (Gastronomical Challenge Oster, the public title for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) from the beginning aroused the envy of the other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on stage.
This was evident at the first bathing suit presentation at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she was brilliant at both, she was known to lack the strength and enthusiasm that the Magdalena and Atlántico representatives showed.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for Canal RCN's "Like at Home" program, believes that Melinda's first-ever title of Miss Universe confirms the fact that the contestant who wins the most titles during the competition does not ultimately leave with the queen's crown".
And Valle's been pretty unfriendly to the media lately, and it's not paying off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just on the sidelines, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia contest, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see more than just physical beauty.You need to focus on social feelings.It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition", she explained.
There is also speculation that candidate Valle lost points due to her background deficiencies and fibrosis, which was evident on her buttocks, but this is in stark contrast to the verdict of the jury that chose her as Miss "Natural Beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who trains the queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but her problems with her buttock fibrosis, which I did not think were too noticeable, took her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the Valle native made a mistake by undergoing several surgeries.
"The surgeries are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The flesh was never her strong suit and here she took her toll".
The award, first given by the National Beauty Assembly, was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled after the swimsuit show, claimed to be the satisfaction of Raymundo Melina not having to give her the ultimate crown.
Whether that's true or not, what's certain is that Melina today began a year of her reign, not as queen, but as princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, to be named the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling success in Cartagena, never achieved the highest crown.
That was the work of a Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonso Cana.
A Cali fingerprint expert has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th of last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC, "Alfonse Cana", through fingerprint comparison.
Of the seven fingerprint experts who work at the CTI, this week's next was Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been in forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the Chocó City Hall, where he often had to walk for more than five days through the jungle to find bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle, and after completing his training, he specialized in fingerprinting, a science that involves the study of skin rubbing, or hand and foot rubbing.
During the week of the operation on Alfonso Can, mentioned earlier, Eliazar was told to bring at least three days' worth of clothing.
Something big was expected.
He left for Cauca on a helicopter from Palmyra Friday night.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Sáenza (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local villager, no glasses, much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a galton magnifying glass, ink and a transplant and a light, Eliazar began to compare the body's dactyl recordings with the card entries.
His eye was not deceived: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was assigned to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to confirm whether he was indeed the FARC commander in chief.
Searching for Traces
For the Sijín de Cali dactyloscope, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of the anti-Cano operations is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, these people help in the investigation of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of those caught.
When caught, many offenders present false documents or no papers at all.
We'll take their prints and run them through the database.
The investigator said that in the case of the injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall because that was where the robber leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed to take fingerprints, but in this case we were able to get a fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in a murder case.
A few days ago, they found a dead man with a bottle of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that a family member may have been responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle did confirm that.
Although it's not 100% certain that he was the killer, it's clear that he showed up at the scene.
A fingerprint expert at CTI explained that the items are "scanned with chemical or physical reagents".
When they do, a graft or tape is used to remove them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a delinquent database, or the registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians today whose data are not listed anywhere", said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it appears on the television show CSI.
Just like all that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch has a trace.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Outraged" protest in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Square, where they were planning to camp.
A large number of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Occupy Wall Street members provoked New York City officials on Tuesday when they tried to get a court order to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated this morning, and then tried to take another New York City park.
Hundreds of protesters have gathered in Zuccotti Square, where they were trying to get through a court order allowing "outraged" people to return to their campsite.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street.
Bray said the "outraged" response to the camp's eviction ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg went all the way to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evictions and allowing the protesters to continue to camp.
In addition to the "outrage", they also seized another park at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish property at Trinity Church.
They managed to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the protesters.
The organization says that several hundred people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious leaders have come to express support and to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing, due to take place on Tuesday, to review the legality of the early morning evacuation.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the officers guarding the square, which sparked "some small clashes", Bray said, condemning the fact that some police beat protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Occupy Wall Street movement or using "laws that were published after the blockade began, or prohibiting protesters from entering the park with shops or other places they used to use".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that the city has suspended reopening of public spaces in response to the court order and warned protesters that local laws do not allow them to return to tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally prevented the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation that resulted in the detention of 200 people and was called off because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it had become "a place where people went not to protest but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses received threatening letters" and "neighbors were worried about their quality of life".
"This morning's eviction was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the working American people", added a spokesman for the movement, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of speech".
Occupy Wall Street also said it plans to hold a "big event" on Thursday in partnership with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two-month protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be playing the Virgin Mary in a Christmas television special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Pamela Anderson, a Canadian, was Tim Allen's assistant on Home Improvement, a swimmer on Baywatch, a bunny on Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television station CTV today announced that Anderson, along with soul singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians will appear on "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, playing the Virgin Mary.
CTV today aired footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known for her Internet home pornography, appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engineer Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a crib.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, who most recently hosted Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, will appear.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special will feature Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisa Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March, and who is close to controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "fox" at one of her New York shows.
Japan is coming back to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% on the back of household consumption, ending a slump that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the material damage at $300 billion, a blow that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the GDP value between July and September reached a point where it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per annum.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery needed to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending fell by 0.9% compared with the January-March period, the first decline after six months of sustained growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse to use the crisis to get us out of it stronger or to rebuild the infrastructure.
Japan has awakened, largely thanks to the growth of domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows have been handed over to the internal market, as the yen - Japan's currency - has become one of the "lifelines" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US outlook.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is bad for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of big tech groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak performance in July to the yen exchange rate in September.
While markets continue to be besieged by the EU's periphery, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said Economic Policy Secretary Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And the prospects are not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most Member States showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts inflexibility in the world economy shows that the major powers' economies are slowing.
It's down four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average of 100, to 99.13.
Athens is again spreading uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the reign of uncertainty, Greece is increasingly entangled in a maze that leads to an exit from Europe's great debt crisis.
The presumption that the "agreement" of the new Greek transitional government is based on the demands of Brussels rather than the real convictions of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period given to him when he was appointed will likely be short for their implementation, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures would not be supported in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections to be held on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit", Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarasa's message does not remove any doubt about his position: "We have committed to help the interim government, but we have no further commitments".
The Conservative leader went a little too far in his speech to the EU and the IMF, which are supposed to unblock the 8 billion Athens urgently needs, but he also said he would not support or sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angry at the impact of Papandreou's referendum games, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign "a clear written commitment as soon as possible".
Amadeu Altafaj, the spokesman for the Economic Affairs Committee, explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" and negotiate with the new government "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of the 8 billion.
That's a hell of a lot of time for a Greek to spin.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain 'has achieved a prominent position at world level in terms of microfinance'.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country had become the planet's second largest donor in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, which is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity.
The Queen opened the 5th World Microloan Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that there is "no doubt" that this type of operation is "completely essential" to reach the UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals of halving the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, the amount that sets the poverty line".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", to whom the loans are primarily intended.
"We have achieved a lot" and "many challenges remain ahead".
The Microloan Summit is not only a forum for discussion, but also a platform to support the 'core objectives'.
Her Majesty explained that the aim is to have 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to raise 100 million families above the poverty line they currently live below.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries around the world after "the pioneering Muhammad Yunus took the journey", the queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and much needed recognition".
She described the father of the tool as "an admirable idealist who set out on a path to fight poverty". She got to know his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to learn about its lending policies on the spot.
This experience was followed by others, such as the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the one in Ivory Coast in 1999 and in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings I have seen a continuous development", explained the Queen, who was awarded the title of 'head of the family' by the 'movement of the poor' in Valladolid yesterday for her support of the project.
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussion and to find solutions to continue the fight against poverty.
"The ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this respect, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of the holocaust, because such cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent "a serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work on the basis of solidarity and not let solidarity become a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the achievement, which celebrates a concept based on giving confidence to people to whom everyone else closes the door.
The CDU proposes to elect the European President on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was held in Leipzig on Monday 14 November without any serious difficulties for Chancellor and chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not on the agenda at first, but it became one only in the autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission, submitted by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates were against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovation of Angela Merkel at the end of her speech and of Wolfgang Schaubl, the pro-European finance minister, a few hours later left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's main idea and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis is 'not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the chancellor of Europe, "the time for change has come".
This could be expressed by changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage 'to give Europe a single face'.
That is at least one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the congress, clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all 27 countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Britain is opposed and the leaders of the CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the course is set.
Likewise, delegates overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to weight each country's weight on the ECB's board according to the weight of its economy, which would obviously result in a strengthening of Germany's weight.
Driven by a concern to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not try to get the Congress to talk about "small" European states or about states in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe has a paragraph on the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she remembered that just two hundred years ago, a bloody battle was fought near Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is disability fraud?
After the subsidies, the UMP and the government launched an offensive against the disabled.
On Tuesday 15 December, Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux to visit the Office for Social Assistance, where he will deliver a speech on the theme of combating social fraud and redistribution of solidarity, a theme that has been recurring since 2007.
As a complement to this offensive, which is based on the will to implement austerity in the context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on disability.
First, in order to save money, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity for work on private sector employees before they start receiving sickness benefits.
Clearly, without the agreement of the company, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, or at least 15% of his monthly earnings.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which according to Les Echos newspaper could bring in 280 million euros.
The measures would also be accompanied by another measure of symbolic scope: giving civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity (as opposed to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the right-wing majority is also raising the issue of fraud, this time focusing on crimes related to disability.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, in addition, if you are caught, you will return", Xavier Bertrand warned in an interview with RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the incapacity for work irregularities.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political pressure that has borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's start with some official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Medical Research and Documentation, daily allowances represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008, at EUR 11,3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity benefits and accidents at work and 54% for incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
That's only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that hides some variations: another survey published in 2007 on the job site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not chosen any day of incapacity.
Another study, this time by the sickness insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37,8% of incapacities were of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to 1 month, 15% of 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more vulnerable to disability than elsewhere.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absences (for health reasons or not) ranged from 10% to 11.8% in France, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Disability cheating is a very small fraction of the underground work.
As for the frauds, they are only on a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks targeting incapacity for work of more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM found that of the 1,5 million checks carried out, 13,8% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term disability were 'unjustified or too long', i.e. 37 050 cases.
For systematically checked incapacities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases 'not adapted or not entitled' were counted in the 1,2 million checks, or 132 000.
This means a total of 169 000 'illegal' cases for several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents far less than the number expressing the work in black.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a June report on the issue, this figure would represent €9-15 billion missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new bailout plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
Speaking to parliament on Monday, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"We need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget to get our economy back on its feet", the Prime Minister said in his first public speech on Wednesday, opening the debate on a vote of confidence in parliament.
He added that implementing the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area was at stake.
As a result, Mr Papademos forecast that the country's public deficit would be 'around 9%' of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed support for measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but said his party was not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures", Samaras stressed at a meeting with lawmakers from his New Democracy party.
We agreed on the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says expert panel
According to a report by the Royal Society of Canada, Canadians are being denied the right to die.
On palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of death denial.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions accordingly.
That is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts in a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government change the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
To begin, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the globe.
Although Canada came in 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalisation yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts with a mandate from the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This is the average for all of Canada, while the province of Quebec has the highest rate, with 86% of deaths in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's conclusions run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said it will not change the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who also examined all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered criminal, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in its application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-compliant or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday that more than a dozen cases of these devices have been reported in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
"Euthanasia is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that according to a 2010 Angus Reid Forum survey, 85% of Canadians have already expressed support for euthanasia, believing that it will allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send a message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed feel that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, say the report's authors.
They also propose that the list of recommendations should include in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally established refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires that medical professionals be trained to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, as regards palliative or final sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission asks that it be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to relieve physical pain and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Objections of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, described the position of the experts-signatories of the report as 'extreme', among other things, because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide", says Pierre Deschamps, who reviewed the summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the report's authors seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed"strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a"manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly skeptical of the report's data on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus is talking about a "conspiracy".
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters demonstrated outside the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria's President Bashar al-Assad intensified, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting them and speaks of a "plot" against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension from the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions on Damascus, while Syria's neighbours Turkey and Jordan have taken a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "hand over power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, a neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts made by Turkey to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's dishonest behavior" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are increasingly taking a harsher tone" against the crackdown in Syria, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Toner noted.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 16 civilians and 19 pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa during this period.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed 'in gunfire and concentrated heavy machine gun fire in Jobar town' in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was "on the way out of the crisis".
He also strongly condemned the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he called a 'dangerous step'.
He also said that the EU was "not going to give in", adding that "plots against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a 'mechanism for the protection of civilians' and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also welcomes the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a regime he says is acting 'paranoidally'.
A new special meeting of the League is convened tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on a plan to resolve the crisis agreed on 2 December, which specifically envisages the withdrawal of troops from cities ravaged by unrest and the release of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League decision "flawed", while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but completely avoided supporting any sanctions against Damascus.

Monti demands time and sacrifice like the Italians
The next Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to put together his team and start implementing a programme that will include "sacrifices" to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade union and employers' representatives today.
He should form a relatively thin cabinet of technocrats from outside the parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the prime minister-designate.
The speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for their time.
In a democracy, "deadlines are set" for the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed, adding that he was "confident that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns have resurfaced following the unexpectedly bright decline in industrial production in the euro area.
The new Prime Minister should set up a team mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include 'politicians'.
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have the confidence of parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti, after taking office, promised to act with extreme urgency and to make Italy 'a strong link again' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that 'even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change'.
The European Union is convinced that, despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013 and calls for new tough measures.
Emma Marcegagli, head of Confindustria, which will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy 'because a country that does not grow cannot meet deficit parameters'.
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) renowned for his expertise and independence, the "professor" who, according to the authors of the introductions, symbolizes a "challenge to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents for Italy"a change of epoch" after 17 years of"Berlusconism".
The big unknown will be the lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid an early election because Italy must place €200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for a nuclear weapon, a US non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) has relied on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws extensively on the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was to work for three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet military research centre in Chelyabinsk (Urals), where he was to produce synthetic diamonds by the method of blasting.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to set up a company in Kiev producing "nano-diamonds".
He was also involved in the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.
He was then to work on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls 'clear evidence that the development of the detonation system by Iran' was based on 'the work of a foreign specialist who not only had a good knowledge of the method but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, had worked on this technology for a substantial part of his career in the framework of his country's military nuclear programme'.
Anti-Muslim crime and delinquency increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, crimes and misdemeanors against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or increased slightly during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes and misdemeanors.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses rise again", Human Rights First, a human rights organisation, stressed.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes", he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reporting of "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights movement.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. to punish violence based on race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and becoming more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, which is somewhat similar to its Facebook service.
The new 'Activity' and 'Name' features allow you to know more directly about the activities of other people who follow you or whose replies ('tweets') you follow.
This lets you know if they're allowing you to track posts, whether they're signing in to new accounts, whether they have favourite posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its unintuitive functioning, with terms somewhat confusing (RT for repeatedly sharing someone else's post, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiates, s'ouvre ainsi and an audience plus large with a handling plus comparable to that of the networks grand public Facebook et Google+.
Users on the network immediately tweeted about the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too similar to Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better track some elements of my Twitter", posted @dannykronstrom.
The following is added:
The European Parliament and the Council shall adopt the budgetary procedure referred to in Article 21 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
The government of the grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to inscribe a "golden rule" of fiscal policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's rating by the AAA.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the end of the Ministerial Conference, at a time when Austria's public debt, at 74.6%, is well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year", argued the multichancellor and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following up on the request of the Euro Area Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly called for the reduction of the general government deficit and the achievement of a balance of the public accounts to be enshrined in the Constitution or in a law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the 'German model', Germany being the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to be reduced by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal government's structural deficit will not exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as the municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens another intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we find too much volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rebounded to historical levels, which forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo traded yen for dollars to devalue the Japanese currency, which had just recently broken its record against the dollar since 1945.
But it has only since then been steadily rising, buoyed by buyouts by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of a global economic slowdown and a European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen again on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen to near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This inflation of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the island's exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the income generated by Japanese companies abroad when they convert it into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation of the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that the yen's rise may not kill the fragile recovery in the wild.
The world's third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% year-on-year) for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of exports and consumption growth by disaster-affected households.
But the prime minister felt that the high value of the yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Political and Monetary Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the bank's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, said the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures" indicating that no further currency weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Securities and Exchange Commission increased its purchases of government bonds by 5 trillion yen (EUR 47 billion) and raised the ceiling on the amount it spends on purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity to 55 trillion yen (EUR 519 billion).
The euro area:
The rates are going up, the stock markets are failing.
The risk of a debt crisis epidemic continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise.
European stock markets, still worried about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 index is down 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and the London index is down 0.1%.
"With renewed tensions over borrowing yields from euro area countries in trouble, equity markets around the world continue to reap only a fraction of recent gains".
"Fearful investors are just too aware of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed down 0.7%, which was due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsušige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is hurting the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reaching its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is worth $1.3570 down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the currency is declining after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday to allow countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, on Tuesday, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce market participants' concerns.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, insisted on the markets for time to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the 'main task' of his government.
Spain is once again in the deliberate market line as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year German and Spanish bonds reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of the euro area growth figures
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter, mainly driven by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0,3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised downwards the figures for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, this is the fourth quarter that economists are most worried about.
For its part, Germany recorded an increase of 0,5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the entire euro area are expected at 11 am, while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma.
If there is one issue that cannot be tackled on the basis of short-term thinking or under emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It's natural that the election meeting is an opportunity to think about these contributions and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are now seven billion people on the planet, but demographic trends will cause the demand for electricity to double between now and 2050, unless we want to deprive a significant part of the world's population of this vital component of life.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil fuels will have to be addressed in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that is currently missing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany is alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case for Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find another source capable of replacing itself, or for Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only state-of-the-art power plants.
In contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few, are continuing their efforts.
The United States decided to expand its fleet by one unit after Fukushima by rebuilding one plant that was interrupted by the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German renewable energy model is ever presented as an example, reality is contrary.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the rise in electricity prices, the increased energy dependence on gas imported, especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal-fired power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves our consideration.
The European champion in wind power, which generates 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which make Denmark's CO2 emissions and electricity prices 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the survival of industry on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a sharp increase in the price of electricity, making illusory the beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, as well as being fundamentally opposed to this energy, as opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has allowed us to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 secondary jobs.
The strong export sector attracts a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these SMEs and lose EUR 6 billion a year which the country earns from the export of nuclear equipment and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer was scheduled to go out of business?
In solving the energy equation, one must admit that there is no magic source for energy production, and indeed no evil one.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a State Agency for Nuclear Safety, which carries out a strict and transparent supervision of the existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of the new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In the last 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island that occurred in normal operating conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
The Chernobyl tragedy was caused by reactor design and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the disaster was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, killing tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it did from the two before it.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all interested parties consider it a good idea, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to AREVA's and EDF's competitors and would pave the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogma and machinery dominate a debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overcrowding of police, courts and administrations subject to a policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of 'land of human rights' of which France boasts.
Recently, it was administrative harassment of foreign students that became a hot topic when the interior minister (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses".
But so far, it's rarely been discussed in terms of economics.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
The right was set to the tune in 1976 by Jacques Chirac, who said that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with 2 million migrant workers", and the left by Michel Rocard, who said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of French territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity we're charged to extend to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities when he claims that joint development will solve our 'migration problem'.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be valid in elections, but it's very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published book, Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, page 352: There is broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration is crippling growth and hurting jobs.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can replace French workers, especially those with lower skills, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that in fact immigrants are much more a complement than a substitute for French workers, by taking up jobs in sectors with a shortage of workers.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not enough to fill the vacancies.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty in working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity between the French and migrants is causing the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would lead to a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average at 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, said he wanted to "pull the wool over the teeth" to make up for the missing percentage of growth.
The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, because although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it has experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece during the 20th century.
Some people may have believed that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to conduct the election and conduct it in the most direct way possible.
But we've known since Napoleon that it was about ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an 'instrument of oppression', as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, the organization of the separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and has been since the beginning of time a crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the mistake of the Greek yes-no referendum will have a double revealing value in this respect: revealing the need for a major return to political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is, the front lines of the Democratic fight have shifted today, and many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We can't get anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organised as needed and disorganized.
White in front of a European absolute monarch or leaping into the empty depths of nationalism with your feet tied: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a joint, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal -- we wouldn't even know where to start the list, anyway -- because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which is suffering from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The European project of democratic sovereignty must be brought back to the forefront.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce their debt burden, get rid of market rule and invest for the future.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, or else lead to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for a European economic government.
Be my guest.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be another madness and a new dead end.
We must take on a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
A revolution in the interests of the people could not have done that.
This lesson continues.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe that is more politically democratic and truly European democratic sovereign.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
Contactless chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should end with a rise in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM phones) of 11% to over 6 billion units.
The most portable is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay on public transport or make purchases simply by bringing your card close to the reader.
Worldwide, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold this year, compared with 320 million the year before!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After being a long-time drag on the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But the big chain stores work for two.
So Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To include a higher speed rating, it is necessary that banks now supply them to their clients.
"Two major French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is just the first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Only a small number of devices today are equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology needed to carry out transactions.
"They're running late".
"But their real momentum should come next year".
"We estimate that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a trial in Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 customers and employees' iPhones will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer that will allow its customers to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The terror front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long-standing suspicions of links to the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had now "gained certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them", he explained without elaborating.
It seems Paris has similar analyses.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the rubble after the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several individuals in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one that leads to a Nigerian long-time resident of Maiduguri, the northern city that is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and another that leads to a man said to be close to AQIM and the sect.
"It's progress, but it's definitely going to take more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more active", mildly remarks Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this 'support' has become increasingly evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which now involve human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQIM.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to address the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
A quick success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf.Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in Hausa, endorses the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicised and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its followers are waging a war against the central government.
These people are first targeting churches, bars and government offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extraordinarily active and increased their attacks on police stations.
The government's response is still the same as usual.
The army surrounds the city, and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its base in the north.
On Christmas 2010, he carried out an assassination in Jos, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it's Abuja again, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should run from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Now that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Iger and Somali al-Shabab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé said that France was on alert and ready to "transmit all information".
The world by presidential candidates
When it comes to issues like China, Iran, or helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are all out to simplify and out to ignore.
Can an America weakened by crisis run the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When you listen to the presidential candidates, the voters might think that.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and briefings on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a stronghold of the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or helping Israel are mixed up.
Mitt Romney, the top contender in the race for the Republican Grand Old Party nomination, has threatened to call the Chinese to the World Trade Organization and accuse them of "manipulating their currency", a hot topic in America fueled by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Even worse, he said, if this has to involve a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with any sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost stuck to an attitude that "smoothed" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is down in the polls, remains unresponsive.
To the picture of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-best placed candidate, shows a disgraceful ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a tough stance against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has had a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he's ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, which was outlawed by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michelle Bachmann.
They're all a far cry from 2008 when Republican nominee John McCain was a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas too and yet he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama was an amateur himself and that he added water to his wine when it came to fighting terrorism.
They point to the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, his hasty withdrawal of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus label him a weakling.
But the attack is not easy.
The public's opinion of President Obama's national security policy, which removed bin Laden, is rather positive.
He's been distrusted by Iraq for military intervention, which leads to stagnation.
And with the argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking on the door.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which links Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been put into operation.
They must supply the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the occasion properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new undersea gas pipeline that will directly connect Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have jointly turned the control valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
This new pipeline will bring an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe each year through the first 1,224 km pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region with the federal state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed by the end of 2012, will supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, an amount equivalent to all French consumption.
And there's already talk of a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction is a victory.
The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic States.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being piped through the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the ability to pressure Russia by threatening to cut off its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the 1939 occupation of Poland.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe's support for this Russian project has given it greater security of purchasing power.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created a rift between Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia barely managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-consuming Western states whose gas fields are running out.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically", François Fillon said at the inauguration ceremony, demonstrating the political and economic importance of large gas contracts.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom executives present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a major technical feat.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel with a concrete cover to protect it from the anchorage of sea vessels.
It lies on the seabed at an average depth of 200 metres.
The construction of the bridge was to avoid the minefields of World War II.
"For safety reasons, almost 100 of them had to be removed or destroyed", says Nord Stream spokesman Jens Müller.
It was also necessary to step up measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, uninterrupted by valves or maintenance stations along its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it, as the Swedes were only reluctant to see the Russian state company permanently established on their coast.
"In the event of a malfunction, we stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the gas line will escape into the air.
But this is considered unlikely by the builders, since the weld was designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
The outer pipe is checked by a ship-drawn underwater robot, while the inner pipe is checked by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device, one meter in diameter, is inserted into the inside of a pipe and pressed with gas.
It shall provide precise information on any deformation of metal parts after the three-day journey at a speed of 3 m/s.
The long-range pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply provided by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at takeoff and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains with Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as Gasunie and GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transmission capacity to this company for a renewable contract of five years.
'Gazprom will profit from the total capacity, whatever the actual amount of gas transported,' explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
The investment costs for GDF Suez thus amounted to EUR 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be recovered, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin on a sandy coastline with pine forests.
The 15 feet high valves form the gas outlet.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - the branded notebook
Moleskine, an Italian company founded 50 years ago, wants to bring back the joy of writing.
It brings a fragrance of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves, white and aged.
After all, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born back in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant working for the company at the time, takes charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old moleskin production technique, which is used for example to treat the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back to life an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists well into the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, to 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from the clandestine production of the early years when only 3,000 minutes were made.
Moleskine is exported across the Italian border to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a virtual portrait of the buyer because the notebook will interest businessmen as much as students or professionals.
The Moleskin notebook's image is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultured, open-minded people.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, has grown to almost 100 and, since 2008, has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain to small boutiques in the city centers where he has been able to assert his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the times and the need for new writing, despite the rapid development of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "The Order", where architects or artists display their notebook.
In August, she also presented new leopard-like notebooks at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases... The brand expands to a whole range of media.
An enviable success: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by investment funds SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers so high?
Some 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today marks the 15th week of employment for the handicapped.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of disabled people unemployed is still twice the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the general population.
Is that depressing?
"No", stresses Éric Blanchet, director general of the association Adapt, which organises the Employment Week for the Disabled".
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher".
"However, much remains to be done".
It must be said that there are still numerous obstacles to the entry into employment of disabled people who are unemployed.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They are low-skilled: 80% have no high school diploma and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is very high: 53% for the handicapped compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and which are 'the core of the problem', according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of the Tremplin Association, which was set up in 1992 to help enterprises recruit disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
What remains unspeakable are ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur pour la Cité found that managers surveyed had"a low level of knowledge about disabled people" with"an exaggerated idea of people in wheelchairs and mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures, which date back to 2008, show a level of 2,6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organisation charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of 'fined' undertakings and the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to EUR 480 million).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, put a lot of pressure on businesses", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large companies".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
"What a stroke of luck".
Before the challenge of the French national team (Bleus) on Tuesday evening (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We won't go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made up.
Five months after his attacker's angry gesture in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward", assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his club and national team performances, "they are one and the same", he apologises.
"I'm in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium".
"I need to clear my name".
Hazard, who was suspended from Thursday night's match against Romania in the match against France, comes to the St. Denis stadium to finally "shine".
The concept of "joy" cannot be overlooked.
Playing against the Blues, who he's been cheering for since he was seven and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This necessarily adds to the 'special' character of the meeting.
He recalls that "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) " on the other side.
"We crossed paths right away".
"To be able to play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly mentioned "pride".
"Pride" to win the "fight - the holiday".
It is also a matter of pride to state, as neighbours, that France has become a very high-level team again, just over a year after the trauma in Knysna, South Africa.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous piece of work", he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French to... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great", he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll realize that for the next games". Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts the barrage with great optimism against Bosnia Bosnia this Wednesday at 22:00 in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism on the way there.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese national football team, which he has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
We have one game left to play and one opponent, Bosnia.
With Friday's 0-0 result in the Bosnian hell of Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal had a lead of over an hour, but they were unable to score a rare goal to relieve him.
"It's a good result, but it's also a risk because we didn't score outside".
But at their stunning home of the Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident of advancing to the audience that should create a boiling pot, even though the match certainly looks "very evenly matched", says the optimistic but sharp-witted Bento.
"We expect a very level game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", relativised Carlos Queiroz's successor.
A draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it also involves risks because we didn't score outside", Bento regrets.
"We will be playing against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be keen to put maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the start, so as not to "give them time to think".
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
