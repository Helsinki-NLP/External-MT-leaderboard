When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back down, almost immediately.
Satellite sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and mirrors.

Finally, there are many small cats (including released pet cats) that eat smaller animals that are much larger in number, such as insects, predators, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special role that every cat fulfills that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in large groups called gangs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Females are usually close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions behave very similarly to wolf or dog groups, animals behaving surprisingly similarly to lions (but not to other large cats), and as such are particularly lethal to their prey.
Being extremely athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group as the lions, tigers and yogies. These four cats are the only ones that can stay.
The tiger's body is not like the lion's bony body, it's more like a sentence of reluctantly shouting words.

They can see well in the dark through night vision, and also sneak silently. They hunt their prey by merging with the environment and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in the past.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments they did in the past.
As the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other, they won't be able to be seen as the same species.

The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered the house of God.
People would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.

Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called zigorats were built as part of temples.
The tower's top was a special shrine to God.

If you've seen a National Treasure movie, you might think a treasure map is painted on top of the Statue of Liberty.
Though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words of the original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.
Although it is not known exactly who wrote it, it is known that in its early days, the large card document (sized 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was scrolling for storage.
So, it's probably just another sign.

During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially established a weak central government - of which Congress was the sole component - within the framework of Confederate legislation.
Congressional powers were lacking to impose taxes and since there was no executive authority or national judge, it relied on the authorities of states, which often did not cooperate, to enforce its laws.
And she didn't have the authority to circumvent interstate tax laws and tariffs.

Subcultures bring together people with similar ideas who feel neglected by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of their age, ethnicity, status, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that define subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture usually mark their societies using unique and symbolic uses in a style that includes fashion, gardening and slang.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to learn from the sad, isolated cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults as they grow up.
"These children are called wild children. Some wild children have been imprisoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment has occurred because the parents refuse to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others, it is claimed, were bred by animals; some are said to have lived alone in nature.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (under physical limitations) almost completely identical to those of the animal being cared for, such as fear or indifference to humans.

Although the wagon tracks were only parallel wooden structures, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads than the slightly more worn-out roads of the time.
The cross-link was introduced early enough to hold the tracks in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.

After approval by Congress on July 4, a handwritten signature by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"During the night, 150-200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Cliffs".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who called it in to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlap copies still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

The main purpose of science is to discover how the world works using the scientific method. This method is, in fact, guiding most scientific research.
But it's not the only experiment, and an experiment is an experiment that's used to dismiss one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, even by scientific research leaders.
Naturalist and philosopher focused on the classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed constraints in physiology and behavior, which often depend critically on the presence of internal recurrences, and their formation by biological clocks.
Periodic coagulation, which is not just a response to external periodic signs, is documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining clocks that will continue for a period of time in fixed cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Chase experiment was one of the leading claims that DNA is genetic material.
The Gerchi and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.

Why do transport systems make such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?Are simple transport engineers unskilled?Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the area of study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain within a consistent range of rational; therefore, traffic flow usually has a rational consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we have relationships between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These links help with the design, design and operation of roads.

Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide crazy.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are the spiders and the beetles.

Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It flows more than 8 times the volume of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes 6 miles wide.
20% of the water that flows through Earth's tunnels into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
"The Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers".
Although the construction of stone pyramids lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom period, no structure surpassed the pyramids in size and construction excellence.
