Two men committed suicide in Kineshma and the surrounding area
One of the hanged men had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, at about 1:00, in the village of Lugovoye at his place of residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It's known he's already attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take this step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man from Kineshma committed suicide by hanging himself at his residence.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Do you have a black box in your car?
As American road designers try to find the money to repair a crumbling highway system, many are starting to see the solution in the little black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and relay that information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America's outdated highway financing system by Washington state planning agencies.
The usually boring arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to have the right to use these little boxes to track how many miles you drive and maybe even where you drive them -- and then use that information for tax purposes.
The tea-drinking movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding privacy.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They're thinking about how, in the next decade, we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have satellite tracking capabilities.
It's really necessary for our country.
"This is not a matter we can choose", said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is planning to start tracking the miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
We already have the technology.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Highway Fund, which is funded by the taxes Americans pay on gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars drive more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise taxes by a single cent with high gas prices.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable", said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on cars to test the faulty payment system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long run", he said.
The Zanuids call it a pardoned user fee.
It's not surprising that this idea appeals to urban liberals, because taxation can change the nature of travel to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planning agencies in California are looking at this system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
However, House Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he too sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market advocates at the Reason Foundation are also excited about making drivers pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go into a black hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward a pay-as-you-go.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters, who often have to travel many miles to get to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and cities, however, are taking this path on their own.
The most enthusiastic is Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are being recruited to participate in the nation's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for mileage instead of gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project is already complete.
He's being considered in New York.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation departments from 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is looking at how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government might be tracking their every move.
"Worrying about Big Brother and stuff like that is a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, chief strategy and efficiency manager at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
As the trials were going full steam ahead, the Nevada chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website: "It will be very easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store the records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states that is struggling to find a low-cost technology that would allow state officials to keep track of the miles driven by a car without any location or time information.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small startup in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of a type of car insurance where drivers pay based on mileage.
But the devices she's testing are attractive to road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that's periodically uploaded through a modem.
"People are more likely to do this if you don't track their speed and you don't track their location", said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There were some major errors in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device altogether, instead choosing to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state drive.
In other places, they're hoping to sell the idea to a vigilant public by making devices do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are looking to develop a tax-paying device that will also accept parking meter payments, provide pay-as-you-go insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobile drivers will be attracted to the benefits offered", says the urban planning document.
Some transportation system designers, however, wonder whether all the talk of overpayment is just a huge distraction.
Officials at the San Francisco Bay Area Transportation Commission say Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be charged to hybrid drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much gasoline to pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a back-up plan to supply Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, should Russia take any action in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Vilnius summit.
The IMF is in talks about a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are capable of overcoming longstanding disagreements over funding terms.
The international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one notch - to "B-" with "B" - does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to get help.
However, EU officials say the IMF can be flexible in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to supply Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
It could be Nord Stream or Slovakia.
The latter, officials say, is the most likely and acceptable way in the event that Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"There are talks between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but by other routes", the source added.
Russia out of the fight for car pollution
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the XX century.
As a rule, the focus was either on rearranging and expanding the highways, or on attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time spent on them.
Singapore is a well-known example, where a strict quota is imposed on the growth of the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
It can cost two or three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart are introducing so-called green zones, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuel or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012 with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Li Kunsheng, director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau's Transport Pollution Control Department, the five-year plan's main goal is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase fuel use per vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, motor vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5 percent of the total air pollution.
The program's main measures include restricting the use of automobile transportation, as well as introducing additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city's "green five-year plan" measures include accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (besides, the creation of incentive financial programs for replacing old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), development of electric transport (including public and service), development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars within the fifth ring of traffic (there are six in the capital of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle number plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number in 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Environment, in 2011 "moving sources" accounted for 41 percent of all pollutant emissions into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, the emissions from automobiles are ten times greater than those from industry, and in St. Petersburg, nine times greater.
Russia is only now beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on city streets.
Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher Education Academy, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car trips are not popular, and can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its car park, where there are two clusters that are not sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of the car park of Moscow).
Recently, urban planners from the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between housing, road surface and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city centre is twice as well-packed with roads as the city needs, and that most motorists living in the centre do not use their cars every day, leaving them for long periods in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but storage areas for cars, not to expand, but to reduce the travel area (so that the streets become more pedestrian friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the protected area of the historic center (with a total area of about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city).
The fines for unauthorized street trading in Vologda will increase by several times
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines will help to bring order to Vologda and free the streets from the natural tents and sheds.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell are often not properly inspected.
Which means the health of the hummingbirds is at stake.
The lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade will increase six times from November - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer loans and massive layoffs.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce turnover", said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
At 6% inflation, it could provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But Russian companies are losing profitability, so they're likely to optimize their personnel costs.
Today we are seeing a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are growing by 10%, GDP is only growing by 2%, Mr Grafe explained.
Companies have faced a reduction in profitability.
If it doesn't, it could lead to job losses and unemployment.
Russian business cannot not raise salaries, comments the chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantyushyn.
Unemployment is near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
To attract new employees or to keep existing ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by the very rapid growth of consumer credit.
In Mr Graf's view, the extremely high consumer loan rates do not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer credit, money is not distributed across the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments", the economist said.
But the other problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting a rise in default on its unsecured loans.
They're mostly taken by the poor who have nothing to provide for themselves.
The interest rates on these loans are high.
As a result, they are less likely to be returned", Mr Grafe noted.
So the second threat to Russia's economic growth is the potential for a credit default crisis.
The director of the Banking Institute of the Higher Education Union, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, not having access to cheap resources like the state banks, were forced to attract the public's money at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went to war and began to lower their lending rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot lend at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up on dumping, Russia is threatened by a full-blown banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The economist sees the loss of a number of banks' licenses in recent weeks as a harbinger of a massive collapse.
"The state banks themselves cannot cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not designed for a systemic crisis", the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow even without the default crisis, the investment bank believes, because of the refusal to index government and military salaries, as stipulated in the current version of the budget.
The impact on consumption will be mitigated in part by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, by lowering inflation).
But only in part: if investment does not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyshin of Barclays Capital does not see the need for such pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the fall in oil prices", he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will start to shrink if the price of oil falls below $90 a barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradox is that inflation has fallen and banks have raised rates.
This could mean that they didn't believe the central bank, which announced the transition to targeted inflation", Clemens told Graf.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"It's a complete failure for the central bank", Clemens Graf said.
The money from the auctions is not used by the banks to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate changes, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will realize that this strategy does not work", Mr. Grafe said, recalling that the state plans to release the ruble by the end of 2015.
But it will have to either do so sooner or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5,5%), he believes.
He estimates the ruble is artificially inflated by 10%.
The only way to cut is to lose weight, the expert concludes.
But if the central bank casts any doubt on the financiers that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it could bring the ruble down much more.
The II South Urals Congress was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is timed to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities - in total about 350 people.
The forum's course is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
We can set an example here, not only for other regions, but for other countries.
We don't have any differences.
We live in complete mutual understanding", - says Theophan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the upbringing of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
The congress passed a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
Here the exhibition of national cultural associations of Chelyabinsk region was opened.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany on matters concerning U.S. intelligence.
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander cannot answer questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Strobel on Thursday met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP released to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection".
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it happen".
Relations between the United States and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA was eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, the congressman who heads the parliamentary group that oversees intelligence, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, without putting him in danger and destroying relations with the United States altogether, it should be used.
Mr. Strobel, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strobel said that according to the lawyer of a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there "in safety", the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "harsh and continuous" campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to his political statements.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including in the United States, have found the unmasking of the uncontrolled, pervasive surveillance system to be beneficial to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to bags in the upper trunk, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers pay just before they get to the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers take care to pay in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it", she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags to be dropped off in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges stuff as much as they can into the carry-on baggage in the upper trunk, which often leaves the trunk empty.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The thing is, Frontier's most loyal customers say it's getting harder to find a seat in the top trunk.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier flight exit can get a bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change to procedures on the Frontier website and check-in counters is designed to ensure passengers are aware of the charge before they get to the boarding gate.
The new Frontier hand luggage charge won't start until the summer, though the date hasn't been set yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of flights after years of losses.
However, most of them did not involve charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage charge three years ago, and another discount Allegiant Air later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage charge brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and he was curious what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit baggage charge.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've seen in my career in the airline industry", he said.
I expected to see a grinding of teeth and a fight at the landing.
The plane was full, he said, and landing was swift.
Frontier also follows Spirit in terms of $2 fees for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can and that the coffee will be provided free of charge.
She'll still be giving out free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but dropped it seven months later after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's initiative to charge for carry-on luggage, where passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest move to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than going to an online travel agency.
But Frontier has gone beyond that.
In September, it began giving twice as many frequent flyer miles as customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium mileage to 25 percent of the mile traveled.
So, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would give you 250 miles.
Passengers can also book their seats in advance only if they buy tickets directly from Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity declined nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline sale.
The NSA blames an "internal error" not hackers for shutting down the site.
The secretive National Security Agency said Friday night that the shutdown of their website for several hours was caused by a technical glitch, not hackers, as claimed online.
NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update, the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal network had not been breached.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online hacker activist group has claimed responsibility for shutting down the NSA website via a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers become overloaded and the site fails.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Formerly the top-secret NSA, once nicknamed "No Such Agency", has come under intense public scrutiny and criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically - all in response to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to speculation that today's incident was the result of deliberate hacking.
Bombardier's profits are down as shipments and aircraft orders fall.
Bombardier Corp., a Canadian manufacturer of airplanes and trains, reported a 15 percent net profit decline on Thursday, driven by declining third-quarter aircraft orders and deliveries and contract problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether its ambitious plans to bring the aircraft into commercial service by next September would be met.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions about whether the testing phase is on schedule.
The results were unsatisfactory and led to a fall of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation Thursday from above the market average to below the market average because he believes stock growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the profit figures in the transportation division", Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family will allow it to take a place in the lower-priced market segment, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominant.
The first prototype aircraft was introduced in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries are not yet too many  177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin was confident that Bombardier would reach its goal of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft were launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program was moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected", Boduan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, which we did.
This will continue throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all others will follow soon, the company said.
Yet analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the timing of the commissioning and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015", said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained at 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents a share and a gross profit of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The Aerospace Department's order book was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were a disadvantage", said Bodouan.
Gross revenue from the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross revenue in the sector rose by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The transport division's order book was $32.6 billion as of September 30, slightly higher than December 31.
The revenue of the transport division was negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, which also announced that Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichett will join the board, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in mid-Thursday's auction.
Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and nearest rival to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profits
The Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony Corporation, which ended the quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, has cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, due to the decline in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company its first operating profit in three years of 5.2 billion yen, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially due to the declining demand for TVs.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of the situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where the company's sales are growing at a rapid pace, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year ending in March 2014, Sony expects to have an operating profit of 179 billion yen, compared to the previously expected 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts had predicted that the figure would be much higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In mid-June, a Japanese company announced the launch of a smartwatch with a number of fashionable features that will eliminate the need to pull a smartphone out of your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and earnings forecast, the company's stock dropped more than 11 percent at the opening of the Tokyo auction this morning, falling to 1668 yen per share.
The speech gene was a synaptic stimulator .
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that allows the Foxp2 speech gene to function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and you can read a summary of the study on the journal's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other.
The researchers found that family members had a disrupted Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of Foxp2's function is to stimulate the formation of new synapses in the brain's speech-related region.
It does this by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by looking for factors that stimulate synapse formation.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 being the only one to blame for its activity.
That SRPX2 does affect vocalization, scientists have confirmed in experiments on mice.
When animals were artificially reduced in gene activity, they cried less when separated from their mothers.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds were restored.
Previously, mice have also been shown to be associated with Foxp2 vocalization itself.
Animals that were given a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, respectively, the SRPX2 controlled by it is related to purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or to more subtle processes.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned gang leader about police investigation jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta was passing information to the criminal authority Neil Scarborough .
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prominent lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was passing on classified information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking investigation after being threatened with a cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and nicknamed "The Tough Lawyer" by criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police sting operation on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related trial.
Officers spotted 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three bags of cocaine at the home of a lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Investigation revealed that Ditta was regularly using a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
For eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organisation involved in the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
42-year-old Ditta passed information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
At Liverpool Crown Court today, Ditt, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, was shamed after pleading guilty to two counts of willful obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to cocaine possession at one of the previous court hearings.
The disclosure of the lawyer came after police investigating Scarborough's activities found that he had been regularly talking to Ditto on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and discovered him walking into Ditt's Blackburn home and placing a 60-percent pure drug in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough was repeatedly contacted by Ditt, who was at a dinner party at Ewood Park, the home of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer came home for the drugs; they had nine conversations.
The court found that Ditta had been a regular user of cocaine after tests found traces of a class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer as he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a "lawyer's secret".
During his detention, Ditta took out his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample taken.
When questioned by the police, he said that in addition to his work, he had a home office, and clients came to his home for legal matters.
However, it was revealed that after several important arrests, he called the biggest drug traffickers, some of whom he had represented in court, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
In her indictment, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that you shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal defense attorney".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney by becoming too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely transcended the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, he disgraced it.
He got too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, to make his disinterest suspect.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and stated: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately".
But after the hearing, senior officer Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditt has gone from being a criminal lawyer to a criminal criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime".
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main members of the criminal gangs who commissioned him to extract valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and instill trust and confidence in the community.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover it with his profession.
Mr. Ditt's investigation was led by the Lancashire Division of Highly Dangerous Organised Crime, which has already convicted him of three counts of possession of cocaine and now of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring fair punishment for offenders.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the scheme were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a Q&A where he says his dream job is to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his perfect dinner partner is Muhammad Ali, and the motivation for his job is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to accommodate 22,000 spectators, police officials who attended the meeting of the Russian Federation's Central Committee of Culture said.
The ticket program is overpriced, they say, about twice as much.
During the match of the 1/16 final of the Russian Cup with "Spartak" was involved only a thousand stewards at the regulation norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were supposed to have 2200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This was announced by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoryanz.
The Americans have been listening to high-ranking Japanese officials
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official, who chose not to be named, said the United States had been eavesdropping on the phone conversations of high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several listening points in the land of the rising sun.
He also noted that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
He said that's what happened during World War II, when these countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, is a target for intelligence activities despite its postwar alliances with the Americans, NHK reported.
Officially, neither side has commented on this information yet.
The news of the US intelligence agency's surveillance of the German Chancellor came out last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have been listening to Merkel's phone for the last ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some sources, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that as allies, which she believes have been Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden has said he's ready to share details of Angela Merkel's wiretapping with German prosecutors.
The German flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
The grain may not be put up for auction until early 2014
During the state procurement interventions, the country can put grain on sale not earlier than the beginning of 2014, according to the minister of agriculture of the republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
At present, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, there is demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put up for auction after New Year", he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that the seeds of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest this year amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
The 2014 crop was sown on 550 thousand hectares (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area for winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the rye has remained at the same level.
There's no Fraternal Circle in the M.E.D. database, which is where Leps was listed in the U.S.
The Russian security forces' database does not include the Brotherhood, which Washington has listed as singer Gregory Leps.
As noted to "Interfax" in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported that the US Ministry of Finance included Gregory Leps in the checklist for suspected membership in the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherhood", all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The spread of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, according to the security structures.
"Even the name, 'The Fraternal Circle,' has an element of mystery, a hint of a secret lodge.
"It's very much like a PR campaign", the source said.
The US Treasury announced on October 31 that it had included Arthur Badalyan, Gregory Lepsweridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalskiy and Igor Shlykov on its checklists for suspected membership in the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherhood Circle".
The individuals on the list are suspected of having ties to Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the U.S. sanctions list since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps "serves as a courier for delivering money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
The Grigory Leps Production Center declined to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "crazy".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama listed the Brotherhood as one of the "significant transnational organized crime groups" and instructed the Treasury Department to "undermine and prevent their global criminal operations".
Putting a person on the US Treasury's blacklist means blocking his assets in the US and banning business contacts from people living in the States.
Scandalous video got to the police
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, known for his outrageous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian city police said they have the video and are ready to launch an investigation into the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reports.
Information that authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use has surfaced on the Toronto Police website.
Local law enforcement chief Bill Blair held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he wasn't authorized to share the personnel data with the public, but he guaranteed their existence.
According to Blair, the Rob Ford compromising video was discovered during a drug raid by law enforcement in the summer of 2013.
The existence of this video has been reported in the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself has not commented on this.
He's just saying he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video footage discovered by police is one of the evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is charged with drug trafficking, extortion, illegal income, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisi was Rob Ford's driver.
The townspeople have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist remarks.
"Rostovaeroinvest" OJSC has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the object.
The amount of the contract at Rostova Aeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the tender conditions, the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will design the airport's new passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of the airport complex's improvement.
At the first stage of construction, the terminal's internal area will be 50 thousand square meters, and it may be increased in the future.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025 the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was concluded, the architectural concept of the South airport complex had been defined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in the implementation of large projects, the company designed the terminals C and E of the "Sheremetyev International Airport" and the new airport terminal complex at the international airport "Knevichi" in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "South" will be built in the Aksay district of Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the city.
Construction of the airport complex is scheduled to begin in 2014, and all facilities are scheduled to be commissioned in 2017.
Politician in Turkey has declared hunger strike against wall on border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of a dividing wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PDM party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, which borders Syria, Ayşe Gekhan, has declared a hunger strike in protest against the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) press service reported to RIA Novosti on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed the protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Güler first denied the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaybin, Aishe Gekhan, a member of the PDM, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the wall into a deadly struggle", the party's press service said.
The mayor believes the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, and the Kurds have been crossing the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never accept", Ayşe Gekan quoted party officials as saying.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaybin.
Venezuela will set a foreign exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1 with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivarian they buy in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be determined later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue its local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was nearly 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial reports, Caracas may decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containing prices for products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of some goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
This spring, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of the "Jug" Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach, - Itar-Tass quotes Belmach's words.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all the options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
We don't just want to find a coach, we want someone who can work with us for a few years and get some results.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
"This is a scary place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent the destruction of the independence of the judiciary by Parliament in the future?" the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media judiciary "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs", he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to "take the media by the hand", and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "have been hit hard", and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The bill is part of a national security effort following the September attack by Muslim terrorists on the Westgate shopping mall.
The Kenyan media has provoked the wrath of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops who were sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo's response was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists could face up to one million shillings with the additional risk of being "excluded from the list", meaning they could be banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations".
She also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called "vibrant blogosphere".
Politicians know that if they shut down the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"Nobody will ever know", wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balance in public life.
"Self-made politicians will ruin the country and return us to hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public outrage in the past.
In May they voted to repeal the cuts made by the National Pay Commission and restore their enormous salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, which is not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure will appear in the municipal payments of the Voronezh residents - deductions for the house's capital repair.
According to the most approximate calculations, a standard two-room apartment will cost from 100 to 400 rubles a month from the new year.
The exact regulations will be determined by the regional government.
But when it comes to painting the driveway, repairing the stairwells, or even replacing the elevator, it's up to the tenants.
The law was approved by the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, noted: "In this case too, we need to establish order - to establish the order of house repairs, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then elsewhere, this will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings".
The state controls the joint construction now.
The law protecting fraudsters has been approved in the final reading.
The document was not born in a vacuum.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems were solved.
By the way, the new law stipulates rights and obligations for all participants in joint construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, stated: "It is no secret that abuses have also started in this sphere, due to the fact that in the 98th year the same shareholders were caught, and in the 2000s the same shareholders".
People started making money off of it to cover the loophole, including passing these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens who are to be deported.
The regional parliament passed this law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems of illegal immigrants in the region, let alone.
Last year, for example, just over 100,000 foreigners registered for immigration.
But only one in five have a formal work permit.
Where the rest of us work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "They broke the law, but they are not criminals".
There's no court, and deporting them is like holding them somewhere.
The Federation decided to equip such places at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - it is the Old Olshanka of the Semilyuk district.
Well, finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with five or more children are exempt from transportation tax.
The budget loses $3.5 million in this case - but the same amount is saved by parents with many children.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt three or more babies will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
The new law provides for 18 square meters for each member of the family, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
A family, for example, is made up of six people - a father, a mother, a natural child and three adopted children.
According to the regulations, the state purchases a house for them with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the Left Bank or the Southwest Microdevelopment, it's a pretty good option.
Well, at the county fair, you could buy a cottage for that.
Baumgertner is nominated to the board of directors of Uralkalia.
The current board of directors of OAO "Uralkali" has proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk general director Vladislav Baumgern to the new composition of the board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner is on the list of 11 people nominated to the new board.
The list was prepared for the November 29th shareholders' meeting, which will determine the new board of directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
He was arrested in August this year on charges of abuse of office.
However, later, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated at a press conference that the accusations against Baumgartner had been reclassified as "stealing".
Matt Dalton, the goalkeeper of the Neftchemik, refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of coach of the Nizhnekamsk team.
The goalkeeper believes that acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys a great deal of influence among the players and will handle his duties.
We'll remind you, today, "Neftekhemik" has sent Krikunov to his resignation.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, - quotes Dalton RIA "News".
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will handle the obligations placed on him - I have no doubt about that.
He's a big name in the team, and he's got a big future ahead of him.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming Italian championship match against Parma.

Also not taking part in the fight with "Parma" Lichtenstein, Vucinich and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quarella is recovering from his injury and ready to play.
The fuel price will rise as a result of a tax maneuver that involves raising the oil extraction tax (FDI) while lowering export duties and raising excise duties.
According to experts, these measures could bring in an additional 619,3 billion rubles.
The head of the Krasnoyarsk court was beaten and his ID was stolen.

US Secretary of State: Special services sometimes "go too far" in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far" in collecting and eavesdropping, but the politician noted that the media's reporting of 70 million people being eavesdropped is not true.
I assure you that no innocent people were harmed in this process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I recognize that, as does the president... and we will see to it that this does not happen in the future", the secretary of state was quoted as saying by AFP.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment is record-breaking.
The data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the population is now unemployed.
Things haven't been this bad since World War II.
Among young people, the rate is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
One solution, according to the Italian authorities, is to provide early retirement for older workers.
The country's largest energy company is already running the experiment, and the legislation allows regional authorities to provide a portion of early retirement for veteran workers.
Italy, on the other hand, faces the same ageing problem as Europe.
And economists are not sure that premature rotation is justified.
What will the construction of the TPU in Moscow lead to ?
Every year , the capital 's authorities promise to build more and more transport-transit hubs .
It is planned to commission 255 TPUs by 2020.
Our correspondent found out what the project was really about.
A few months ago, a fence was erected at the Smolensk metro line.
The sign said that a transport hub was being built.
All this was very strange, since no land transport stops near the "Smolenskaya" and, therefore, it is impossible to cross it.
To get to the nearest trolley stop on the Garden Ring, you have to walk about 130 meters, including the overland crossing through the Karmanitsky alley.
Smolenskaya's almost finished.
The flower shop is gone, the newsstand is dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance is replaced by a brick.
That's the whole transportation hub.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the capital transport department.
There's no capital TPUs yet.
The flat-floor projects involve the construction of parking lots, the removal of commercial facilities that impede passenger traffic, the creation of small architectural forms and the improvement of the landscape.
Actually, the flat-bed TPUs are not even handled by transport workers, but by professional planners from the department of capital repairs of Moscow.
A transportation hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes a roof over your head and a signboard are enough to warn you when the transport is coming.
For example, the Yasenovo metro recently opened a fully-fledged flat-floor interchange.
No awnings, but with intercept parking and a signboard indicating when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials write down everything they find.
In 2011, the city had planned to build 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now, there are 255 TPUs planned for 2020.
One and a half hundred of them are scheduled to be delivered this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of the TPU, no quality criteria are specified, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
They're counting by the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often gets worse.
The expert believes there should be two criteria: first, reducing the time it takes to transplant, and second, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the mode of transport without getting into the rain.
In Moscow, the situation is the opposite.
A vivid example is the VDNH subway.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the World Trade Center.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavl to Cosmonauts Street.
Farther from the subway, farther from the monorail, but closer to the residential buildings.
The residents didn't want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible instances.
The capital-management company in Moscow didn't work out right away.
The first one started five years ago at the Plannerny subway.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And it really is a pattern of how a transplant hub that's been sold off to investors turns into a trite shopping mall.
No, there's bus platforms, a railing to keep you from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
However, the Chymkin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 were not given a place in the Moscow TPU.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
There's more room to trade.
32 clothing stores, and there's almost everything from pet stores to car dealerships.
Well, actually, who on the bus would need to buy a new car on the way?
We have a capital-building complex, and for some reason, it always turns into a shopping mall.
The situation reached its logical conclusion recently when a part of the parking lot was put up for sale.
Now, on the third floor of the Planner's car park, there is a lot of traffic.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards staring at our photographer.
The transplantation hub has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, there used to be a market at the Planerny subway, but they tore it down.
And in the prefecture, the merchants took pity and let the intercepted parking of the transfer station.
It's always empty because of the high prices.
The funny thing is, the market was torn down to make room for a new... flat-bed unit.
That's the way it is.
At the metro "Kaluzhskaya" the distance from the vestibule of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, supposedly the TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the structures on the "Planer" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear in bloom.
In mid-September, the city-building-land commission of the mayor's office approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25 stories, not counting the two or three underground floors.
The main monster will grow near the metro "Tushino", it will be 418,7 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the railway station directors of the Russian Railways, who are responsible for the construction of the TPU at the metro, have already told journalists that shops, hotels and apartments will be located in the future multi-storey buildings.
Officials say that multi-storey parking lots will take up between a third and half of the area.
Take the example of the public garage.
Let's say a 258-seat garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square meters.
So, for parking for 2,600 cars at Petrovsko-Razumovskaya, you'll need about 80,000 square feet.
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build.
Let's get one or two floors for all kinds of bus platforms.
There's at least 150,000 square feet of commercial real estate left.
And that, for a minute, is almost two GUM.
If the capital TPUs at stations and stations are built by railway workers, the rest of the sites will be mastered by metro workers.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow City Property Department recently told reporters that they are working on a draft resolution that would allow investors to apply directly to officials for a plot for the TPU.
No competition at all.
Because he says transportation is a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard in Boston or Spadina in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend below ground level to the level of the metro, and the distance from the metro car to the tram is only 50 meters without going out onto the street.
No unnecessary trade around.
But Moscow officials are being pushed to the extreme.
Either we don't build anything, or we tear down 25 floors of office and apartment buildings.
Esser proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremism
To protect citizens' patriotic feelings from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Just Russia" proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish it with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma committee on energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government for a conclusion.
Under the patriot feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, there are sanctions in the domestic legislation for abuse of the formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians whose feelings can be hurt by insulting state symbols and other displays of disrespect for our country, in the Russian legislation is not enough.
As an example, he cites the annual debate on the eve of Victory Day, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the USSR people in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real Vakhanalia is held every year.
Some publicists, exercising their wit and "alternative view" of history, have come to reason that it is a pity that educated Germans did not conquer the savage Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual strength" of the nation", - Oleg Mikheev is indignant.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are more patriotic people in Russia than religious, but the law punishes for offending the feelings of believers, and offending patriotic feelings can be practically unpunished.
According to the people's representative, it is necessary to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to prescribe a corresponding punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a fine of 100,000 to 5 years in prison.
The 6.6-magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reports.
The quake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and 54 kilometers southwest of the city, the USGS website said.
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 Moscow time on November 1).
No casualties or damage from the quakes have been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active areas on Earth, so earthquakes of varying strength are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
Then, the 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami killed more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile was the site of the most powerful earthquake in recent history, recorded at magnitude 9.5 in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died in that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be heard in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law", Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eroux.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizan, like the other activists, is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture in respect of the detained citizen", Mr. Erro was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to break the laws", Medvedev said.
According to him, the activity of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, is dangerous.
He said the facilities were "like a powder keg" and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reports.
UN announces new goals for poverty alleviation
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to end global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in pushing for the SDGs to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that kicked off in Rio de Janeiro last night.
They were included in the final version of the document that world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, will sign during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told summit participants the night before that now was the time to "stand above national interests".
I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating the Universal Goals for Sustainable Development, he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to use the powers vested in me by the Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique mounted by power struggles
Under a statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, which looks down on them, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant slogans of peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, the executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd at Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo - some of the most violent since the armistice was signed more than 20 years ago - have been coming in.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to revert to full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the U.S.'s Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party blame each other for the tension.
The Renamo Party claims the government was behind the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, Renamo's traditional stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill group leader Afonso Dhlaka, Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandou Gbousa has tried to allay fears of instability.
Gebousa told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "failure" who wanted to use "everything that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist on avoiding war.
However, concerns grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant the Frelimo party's failure to comply with the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness", Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two powerful people (Gebouza and Dhlakama) facing each other", said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The vote share for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party  Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Gebouza, who is due to step down next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency", Mazanga said.
It's unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and swift attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo but includes the Beirut port, which mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique", Mazanga said.
The instability has increased dissatisfaction with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and they have to find a solution to these problems", he says.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, said people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads", he said.
The first series of "Art-mainstream" film screenings will be held in Moscow
The series of "Art-mainstream" film screenings, where the audience will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the "Rolan" cinema from November 1 to 5, RIA "Novosti" reports with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program will be opened by the French comedy "Paris at any cost" by director and actress Reim Kerichi.
This is the story of a model, Maiya (Sama Kericchi), who works in the French capital, but is deported to her homeland, Morocco, because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerchi's film, the audience will also see the new film "Mebius" by the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk, the melodramatic biopic "Diana: A Love Story" by Oliver Hirschbigel (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Adel's Life" by Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian participant of the "Art-mainstream" will be the winner at the "Kinotavr" festival of Alexander Veledinsky's film "Geographer globe wasted" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming failure-teacher Viktor Sluzkyn - in the film was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the "Kinotavr" prize.
Children should learn myths and legends as "lifestyle models", says the author.
The stories of the Torah might show that "rough force cannot defeat subtle cunning", and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too indecent to be taught in schools", Crosley-Holland advocates "a careful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating for them to be part of the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the "excessive moralizing" of authors and teachers "refuses interest" in children, and the basic ideas are "sublimated" in fascinating stories.
Crosley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and also wrote A Collection of Norwegian Myths for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have intentions, but you'd better keep them to yourself".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some sort of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or have a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it needs to be sublimated; it needs to be revealed through history, not articulated.
The old saying, show, not tell.
Football fan arrested in Voronezh for smashing the window of the waiting room
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29 at the station Grzy-Voronezh transport police officers took two football fans - natives of the Moscow region - from the passenger train.
After heading to their favorite team's game, the boys had a drunken party on the way.
The young men were taken to the line police station in the Dirt Station to make a report on the administrative offence.
There, fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police filed administrative charges against them and let them go.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for him at the station.
At midnight, the fans left the train station, but one of them, a 22-year-old, returned unexpectedly and kicked the entrance window of the station's waiting room.
The sound of the broken glass was heard by the transport police and the guard of the "RZD" Chernobyl.
They were able to apprehend the assailant, who was trying to flee the scene.
The South-Eastern L.U. of the Russian Interior Ministry is conducting a check.
The issue of criminal proceedings is being resolved, said the senior referent of the information and public relations department of the South-Eastern LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in transport, Sergey Olkhovik.
The water-pumps?
I feel like we're back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots on the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartack".
I'm in favor of sports event organizers being responsible for all this: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we see that they've taken a different position.
They're waiting for someone from the outside to come and clean up.
It's a very good position, but not quite right.
We need to organize the fans, the clubs should invite their stewards, not let it go by itself.
We've just developed a special government regulation on stadium conduct.
Once it's passed, we'll get to the bottom of it.
But I'll be sure to invite all the football organizers to my house.
I read the interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state is saying, give the law quickly.
It's like the Bayern fans came to Yaroslavl and set it all up.
We're outside observers.
It's horrible to see the stands being flooded with fireworks.
And that's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years", Mutko said.
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
Former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify in the case of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's wiretapping.
As a source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday, the American can answer questions from the German prosecutor's office in writing or face-to-face in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In that case, he will lose his refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by the countries that are allies of the United States", the source said.
"However, in principle, the Federal Prosecutor's Office could send its representatives to Russia or send written questions to Snowden", the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Schrebel reported that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of the American intelligence services eavesdropping on the German chancellor's talks.
Snowden is prepared to testify to German law enforcement either in Moscow or on German soil.
The ex-CIA guy made it clear he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival", - told the Euronews channel.
Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement by an Interfax source, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide would be up to him.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he disclosed information about secret US intelligence operations on the Internet.
Snowden was flying through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the US authorities, who made serious accusations against him in absentia, and he remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo the same day.
Yesterday, the American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client had taken a job at a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported last week by the German media.
According to journalists, the Americans began listening in on the chancellor's phone conversations as early as 2002.
The tracking station was supposedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
German authorities have since published the information, saying that the surveillance of Merkel violates German law and sovereignty.
Ponomarev has left "Just Russia"
The Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Justice Russia", member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted a statement about leaving the political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he submitted the application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to her charter, that automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "Righteous".
We're sitting here, having tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal about it", the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of "essers".
Meanwhile, Ilia Ponomarev has no intention of giving up the mandate of the State Duma.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and according to the law could not leave it.
The news of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the party "Just Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that along with him from the "SR" will come out Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan to discuss peace treaty with Russia
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kisaki met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of the peace treaty", Kissida said at the meeting.
The Japanese foreign minister recalled that after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the two countries became more warm and bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that Russia will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of the peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the settlement of the disputed Northern territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost to the country after World War II.
Cars are driving through the Japanese capital, with loudspeakers saying: "Give back the northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure the noise level doesn't go too high.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: The New Yorker is a great way to celebrate the end of the year.
It's safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a century ago, stage performer Frank Faye, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in a conversational manner.
Fay's innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hersch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, featuring more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started out in the Carolinas, and then they got more successful, got to the point where they're too famous to play in a club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the annual "Standup for Heroes" musical-comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in unconventional ways, such as through shows on smaller TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to fame through his role in the comedy series on the little-known cable channel (notably the scandalous FXX fantasy football show Liga), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has appeared in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for the viral series Marcel the Shoe-Shallow.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a distinctive style (the surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the cunning, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director in television and film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely the centerpiece of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down some alley between two houses and thinks, "If I run out of money, maybe I'll live here".
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of Pakistan in the UK, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The Pakistani prime minister made the announcement about negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has announced that dialogue with the Taliban has begun", the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan", the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the northwestern areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are trying to create an Islamic state.
Earlier, the government of Islamabad had attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only go to talks if the authorities took troops from Taliban-held areas to permanent positions and released Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif has arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil has fallen to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about large reserves overshadowed reports that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The U.S. benchmark for December's supply of crude oil fell 14 cents, to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning, European time, in electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was down 39 cents, which is a 5.8 percent drop in the price for October.
The rich oil reserves have affected its price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. reserves have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves have been replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But Friday's indication of a possible surge in demand came from two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after the third quarter's growth rate rose to 7.8 percent from a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, a benchmark international oil used by U.S. refiners, has fallen 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel at the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Colorado head coach Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas SE scout Natalia Shmeleva.
What are we waiting for? Ru said after the morning's "Avalanche" rocking.
Of course, we're all concerned about what happened, but we're confident in him and we feel it's good for him to get on the ice tonight.
We want him to come out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely certain that the situation has not affected the goalkeeper's condition?
We'll see about that tonight.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him secure the goal, as they have done in previous matches this season.
The important thing is, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court has a handle on this situation.
In Siberia , you can 't be a vegan: greenhouse tomatoes can 't replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
They can't survive the winter here without losing their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors surveyed on the eve of the Vegan Day.
Drinking the oil in litres
Strict vegetarianism, when not only meat and fish are abstained, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists believe that in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities, such strict dietary standards are at least not beneficial to health.
A complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids that are very difficult to replace with plant proteins.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet", says nutritionist Marina Bogai.
She cites fish as an example, which contains the essential omega-3 fatty acid.
The most abundant vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"To consume it in the quantities needed by a person, you need to drink liters!" says a nutritionist.
Doctors believe that Siberians should pay special attention to their diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is especially questionable.
In our reality, food is highly demanded.
You need to eat more calories to keep from freezing.
"If a person limits himself to animal foods, he is therefore lacking in these calories", says the expert.
That is what dietitian Olga Pozniak agrees with.
She adds that importing fruits and vegetables is not the answer.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods grown in the region where he lives or where he was born.
The genetic code is tuned to better digest and digest these foods.
And in winter, people don't want to eat cucumbers, but hot soup or something more nutritious", explains the doctor.
She says that what vegans can eat is really good: grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples left over in the winter, frozen berries.
But that's clearly not enough for proper nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians only have enough vitamins in their bodies from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete vegetarian diet in our harsh natural environment, where temperatures can fluctuate by 30 degrees in a day and snow falls in May, is not practical.
The body needs energy to live, and that is primarily fat", says the doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by being vegetarian, we're giving them a little bit of a break.
Pregnant women also need a high protein, vitamin and micronutrient intake.
"Vegan women are missing them", I'm sure of it.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play with whatever toys he wants".
He has a body, a skeleton, organs.
And yet children need to be fed properly.
If parents deprive a child of certain trace elements or amino acids by choosing what to eat for him, it is simply a violation of the child's rights.
"The lack of nutrients for brain development, vision, and bone growth is not something that can be repaired tomorrow", she says.
All the medical experts surveyed agree on the poor quality of winter vegetables and fruits grown in greenhouses and imported.
What we bring in and grow in greenhouses has less of the micronutrients we need than what we grow in the open.
"The quality of the products is not the same", says Bogai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more harvests damages the quality.
"Apples do not turn brown when cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and mould, and tomatoes are tasteless and odorless", he says, adding that they are likely to be over-fertilized.
And they become suppliers of fiber, not vitamins.
This is not agreed by the laboratory of the Siberian Physical-Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and with all the standards and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to grow more per square meter, then of course they'll water more often and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too much nitrogen is added, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large but watery and unsweetened", she explains, adding that the quality is primarily a matter of conscience on the part of the producer.
The court suspended the execution of the New York Police Department 's " stop-and-search " practice .
On Thursday, the federal district court of appeals suspended a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has said that the execution of Judge Shira Shandlin's decisions will be suspended until the results of the city's appeal are received.
In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in the way it implemented its street detention and interrogation program.
The city appealed her decision and the corrective measures, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the appeals court heard the parties' plea for a stay.
The Court of Appeals said it needed to dismiss the judge because she violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably targeting blacks and Hispanics under the Stop-and-Search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the sweeping changes, which include policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot program to test TV-captured cameras in those police stations where most arrests occur.
In August, New York City decided to end the practice of keeping names and addresses of people whose cases were closed after police checks.
The city's appeals are due to be heard after March 14, 2014.
The "stop and search" tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The practice of stop-search has been around for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stop-searches increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all  representatives of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the New York Police Department's Stop-and-Search program say the changes will end unscrupulous practices, create a more reliable and efficient police service, and could affect how other police departments implement these practices.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale rather than crime, lead to unnecessary spending, and fail to solve the more global problem of police conditions being challenged by the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that she is not ending the practice of "stop-and-search", which is constitutional, but is changing the way the NYPD stops people.
Pedestrian zone opened in the Tretyakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has been created in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a two-kilometer section from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Boletna Square.
Street stalls, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets have been installed throughout, and deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
Besides the Klimentovsky and Lavrushsky alleys, which were already pedestrianised, five streets were closed to cars - Ordin's dead end, the Large and Small Tolmachevsky alleys, the Kadaševsky embankment and the Swamp Square.
The traffic on the streets of Marošeik and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the Friday street section from the vestibule of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Client's alley conditions for pedestrians were created without removing the traffic and cutting the road, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the church of the holy martyr Pope Clement, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the Tver Pass, Stolesnikov and Kuznets Bridge streets were completely pedestrianised.
The big Dmytrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, is scheduled to be closed to cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson hacked into the phone to verify a confidential message.
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation to try to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clark, then Home Secretary.
The prosecutor, the Crown Counsel Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey that in May 2005, the News of the World received a false report that Clark was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polley.
The paper assigned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Paulby's voice mail and stalked her outside her home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, and the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor, is not the kind of person who would stand near someone's house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he's the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they say", Mr. Eddis said.
He said that the News of the World used three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
He obviously knows about the second one, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Rumors of Clark's affair first caught the attention of the News of the World when a source with a sexual interest in Ms. Polby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A voice-message tape taken from her phone at least three times was recovered from Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found a private detective's computer recording of Ms. Polby and her sister as the "Projects".
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Paulby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Eddis said.
At this time, former lead reporter Neville Thurlback and former reporter James Weiserup were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles".
Mr. Addis said Coulson's involvement in this story was in the same vein as other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blankett about an affair with a married woman while he was seeing his correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with other people to break into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlback and Weserup have confessed to hacking into the phones.
Snowden says he 's ready to talk to the authorities about the wiretapping case .
Ex-CIA officer Edward Snowden is ready to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and meet with representatives of the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, reports RIA Novosti.
The letter from a former CIA officer to the German authorities was presented to reporters in Berlin on Friday by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Schrebel, through whom Snowden had conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Schrebelé met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people injured in Tver street fire
Four people were injured in the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tver street.
According to Interfax, citing a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by were injured in the smoke-filled underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti, citing the head of the capital's fuel and energy department, Pavel Livinsky, all houses on Tver Street are now fully powered.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tver street occurred on the evening of October 31.
Strong smoke came from the storm drains, and a smoke plume formed in the underground passageway near the Armenia store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya street were left without power.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
The U.S. is cutting food aid to the poor
The food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 a month
From Friday, the U.S. will reduce the financial support for food stamps, as the government's food stamp program ends.
Food aid for a family of four will now be $36 a month less than before, officials say.
It will affect the 47 million poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, the average monthly allowance per person was $133 in fiscal 2012.
Food aid spending in the United States has risen to $80 billion a year because of rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid, given out on "food stamps", a name that dates back to the days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be focused on helping those who need it most.
Grocery store owners across America are concerned that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. lawmakers continue to debate how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old free-to-play platformer
Blizzard released their 1994 platformer Blackthorne for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available on Battle.net in the Blizzard classic games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts are on the American part of the service can download it.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to media reports, the version that Blizzard has released for PC is not different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform game, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES.
It was set on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros, Kyle, who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight Sarlak's minions and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
New machines will be installed in the Moscow metro.
But they're not gonna sell tickets for money, they're gonna sell tickets for seating.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of seats will be counted by a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first unit will be installed at the Exhibition Station on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket sports machines will be accepted by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolotchikov.
The National Security Agency 's admissions are fueling corporate paranoia about state surveillance .
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German internal intelligence service, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the US embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the listening devices' antennas, and these actions prompted talks between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of National Intelligence, reassured in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies' trade secrets for the benefit of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden - a contract employee turned whistleblower - began to publish his treasure trove of US intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted on his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency was monitoring Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by US cloud service providers including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia over state surveillance to new heights.
The latest news was that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then of course the potential targets are business leaders.
Snowden made it clear that there was intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence community and the companies.
I think it's very likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi association, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost as much risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting firm EY.
In all the documents Mr. Snowden has uncovered, however, there is still no evidence that the United States has transferred the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option", says Gassso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
And yet the scope and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies that Snowden's revelations made famous came as a shock to some companies that previously thought China was the biggest risk of spying.
The big shift is in cloud technology, where CEOs in European companies have become more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. members abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. Prism data-analysis program.
Jim Snape, one of SAP's executives, said, "We're seeing consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, which is, where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will stay physically in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials claim that the latest messages are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore that this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is happening is not surprising.
It always had a place.
"This has been a topic of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy", says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders do not usually like to brag about the response they have taken, as it may give an advantage to the opponent.
Big companies have long been taught that taking a free flash drive at a trade show or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, at least, reckless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of the carmaker Audi, says that for years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Germany recommends that business leaders consider using a simple prepaid mobile phone while traveling abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their particular niche.
Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorised access,  warns the BfV report.
The U.S. warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Review in February ranked France along with Russia and Israel as the second-largest perpetrator of economic intelligence hacking after China, The Washington Post claims.
A board member of a prestigious German company has confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, was reported to have said in an interview this month: "The agencies know perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies".
The parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a "ridiculous accident" believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertical mat, leaning back against the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
Investigators with the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department have concluded that Johnson died tragically by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes this.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They think it's against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense", Kramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he came back to them in a body bag", he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the preliminary autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of positional asphyxia.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed a different cause of death.
"There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified", he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video footage that investigators have been looking at.
The teen's parents said they hope the videos contain a clue to how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about the people who hung the fascist symbols
On the official website of "Spartacus" there is a statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance of a fascist flag on the platform in Yaroslavl.
"At the cup match between Shinnik and Spartak on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We ask anyone with credible information about the perpetrators of this crime to provide it.
"The reward is guaranteed", the statement said.
We're looking for the fans who hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl.
Recall that in the match of the 1/16 final of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartack" several times interrupted due to disorders on the stands.
Also in the sector of the fans of "Spartacus" was demonstrated the fascist symbolism.
As a punishment, Spartak can play about three matches without spectators.
There's a committee meeting on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried and hung this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a recommendation for schools regarding allergies in children.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in school children on Wednesday.
This is the first such list issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies continues to rise.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that food allergy rates among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness of food allergy in children among teachers and staff and how to help in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep supplies of adrenaline  most commonly used for injections is the EpiPen automatic medical syringe  to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently amended the regulations to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less hassle.
The notice also lists the typical symptoms described by children who have developed an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I feel like something's sticking in my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue", or "My tongue is tickling".
Intersex parents can choose their gender
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with external genitalia of the intermediate type.
It will no longer be necessary to assign male or female sex to newborns.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as undefined or unestablished on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure on parents who might make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later: "I'm neither a man nor a woman".
I'll still be a doctor-created, patchy product with bruises and scars.
About one in every 2,000 babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersex, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as having a disorder of sexual development, a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seminal cords), or abnormally developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still understudied, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it's better to use all the information available and assign it than to wait and track the child's psychological and physical development before performing the surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good idea".
Intersex children are creating an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don't", he said.
You can assign gender without surgery and then watch the personality develop.
The science of how a child develops any kind of gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a riddle about why people are gay.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexuals or transgender people, since their condition is related not to gender but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female gender, and is typical for both at the same time or is not characteristic for either.
These characteristics may be manifested in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts, and body shape; in primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender dysphoria now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or third gender in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Norrie May-Welby of Australia became the first person in the world to be declared "sexless" by standing up in court for the right to maintain her "indefinite" gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F  X, which means intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in France, a country of strong Catholicism, signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is being pulled into a new state where gender is a matter of choice and sexual activity is not, we are overturning two more pillars of civilization".
A mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have her children's gender determined at birth.
"Raising a child is hard enough and without any extra restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child", she told the parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sex organs were called hermaphroditic  after the beautiful Greek god who possessed the traits of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a sheet of paper that you could erase and then paint over.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choices, not knowing how a child will perceive their assigned gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Dresser said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist. You called a surgeon.
The dominant theory for how to treat children with intermediate genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily modified.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social signals, how parents raise a child, interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person will consider themselves male or female.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were challenged.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a careless circumcision to completely castrate the child, removing his testicles as well, and raise him as a girl.
"Many presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't", Dresser said.
When the boy was about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still using this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex-change operations said they were "dissatisfied with the outcome".
That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate genitalia.
The doctors couldn't tell if he had a large clit or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live the "full life" of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genitalia and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He started receiving female hormones at age 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he found out the truth, he became a man again, getting testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he's an advocate for others at an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the way people perceive intersex people.
But Ann Tamar-Matthis, executive director of the California legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "incites stigma and stigma".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child a 'gender uncertain'", she said.
We're afraid he's going to facilitate the intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we haven't seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law as it allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexuality", she says.
German law implies it's at birth.
It's a battle that young children shouldn't be in at this stage.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammologist-röntgenologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a developmental disability and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law will "support" both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a disorder called total androgen insensitivity.
Because her androgen receptors are malfunctioning, Kathy has developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at 29, Kathy is married and completing a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time to not make hasty decisions themselves", said Barac.
It gives them time to do some analysis and figure out the situation, and also a time frame before they write  masculine or  feminine.
Then you're fine. You're raising a child, you love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that drives parents because they don't feel like they're doing the right thing", she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which sex is more comfortable for him or her, and that's great.
It gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago's goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands that he has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two "Yastrebs" meetings, Habibulin first missed six shots from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed shots.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't been able to do that, "CSNChicago quotes Habibulin as saying.
I need to get some confidence in training, maybe approach it like a game, and try to get the best out of it.
You need to look at your past games and work on the flaws that were there.
There are a few small components I need to improve, but I feel pretty decent in training.
But somehow after a few heads, it all turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers -- I don't think I'm the only one -- always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens outside my gate.
I'm still working on myself not to miss so many shots.
It's great that my teammates are supporting me, but basically, it's just, I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to do it a lot better.
But what happened, happened.
I've got to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next game better.
A bus has overturned in Altai.
In the Rubtsov district of the Altai region, a PAZ bus overturned.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were injured, according to the regional emergency department.
Earlier, the region's law enforcement agencies reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at about 9 am local time on the Novo Nikolaevka - Vishnevka highway, 1 kilometer from Novo Nikolaevka.
The bus, which was traveling from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, had 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom suffered injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven injured were taken to the Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, two people were hospitalized in the Central Rural Hospital of Rubtsovsk.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after establishing itself in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
"We expect to receive more than 170 such aircraft in total", Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, according to Interfax.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, as it is a joint project.
We've been discussing some financial issues today that are related to insurance, but we hope that once this plane is established in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will one day be delivered to France", the Russian prime minister stressed.
The SSJ-100 is a single-engine, single-engine aircraft built by the company "Civilian Aircraft of the Dry" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
The Dnipropetrovsk region's energy department has launched a unique program to save the oyster nests.
In ancient times, to attract the eels to the yard, the peasants would set up a wheel from a cart on a high pole, and the heavy nest would hold on well.
Such special supports have long since been discontinued, so the aist has become a fan of the poles of electrical power lines - the intertwined branches rest on wires, making the aist home stand firmly.
Anya's grandmother, whose home in Ivanovka, Petrikovsky District, has been home to an atheist family for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are laying new branches on top, and the bottom layer is already stuck between the wires, about to fall.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of oysters, which every year nested in the yard, brought out and fed three or four chicks for the summer, but you don't want to be without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warmer regions, Anja's grandmother called the Tsarichany power plant, which owns the support.
I didn't expect the reaction to be so quick.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still held, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dnepropolaneergo" Sergei Berezovsky.
The wires, which were in fact inside the nest weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, began to corrode.
At any moment, the birds could die from the electric shock.
And the locals were at risk of losing their lights because of the damaged wires.
So the line assemblers started a rescue operation, and this is not the first time we've done this.
Scientists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University helped develop the nest transfer scheme.
They've been training the network staff.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the energetics at all stages of the nest reconstruction.
First, it was estimated that there are more than 50 atheist "apartments" in the area in a state of emergency.
Special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded for their reconstruction.
The foundation was covered with ivy branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
Experts say that just laying old branches as a foundation allows birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the eels will build their own nest.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoscow district.
A new iron-concrete pillar was erected next to the electric support and a platform with an old, already occupied nest was placed on it.
The whole operation cost the energy workers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same new settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka of Petrikovsky district in the yard of Ani's grandmother.
Here, the platform is fixed in its original location, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
The same reconstruction is expected to take place in four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovsk region before the end of the year.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others are killing them mercilessly.
A few days ago, the whole region was hit by a sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostol district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers shot a family of swans living on a local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not afraid of humans at all - the local people fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and four beautiful swans were already dead on the water.
Now the police of the Apostolic District are trying to find out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The "Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, the Day of National Unity, the "Russian March" will be held in Moscow, as agreed with the mayor's office.
According to a survey by the Levada Center, the support for the "Russian Marches" is growing - 40% of citizens already approve of the idea of holding them to varying degrees.
According to the "Levada-center", 40% of citizens in varying degrees approve of the "Russian marches": of them 11% are definitely positive and 29% - "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006 these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the number of citizens supporting such events was twice as much (28%).
Only 7% of Russians are "definitely negative" about the "Russian marches", while 19% are "rather negative".
Another 35% were unable to articulate their attitude to the campaign.
This year, Moscow's mayoral council agreed to hold a "Russian march" of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, according to the head of the capital's security department, Alexei Mayorov.
This nationalist action has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Have you heard about the "Russian marches" held in Russia on November 4 under the slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered negatively.
Now only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this campaign .
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 about "Russian marches" were heard by almost a third of citizens (31%).
Three years ago, on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place on Manezhnaya Square, which turned into mass riots.
The "Levada Center" also asked Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (People's Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of the population attend.
About the same number (17%) intend to celebrate October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow mayor's office agreed to the "Russian march" in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the "Russian" association, the organizer of the march, Dmitry Demushkin.
Besides the march in Lublin on the Day of National Unity, a rally and a rock concert by the band "Kolovrat" will also be held, which was also agreed with the authorities.
How the "Russian March-2012" went
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from Yakiman Embankment to the Central House of the Artist, where a rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6 thousand.
Message: Obama campaign staff was considering eliminating Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton .
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election.
This discovery is the brightest sensation in Mark Halperin and John Heilmann's highly anticipated book on the 2012 campaign, "Doubled Up: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's closest aides conducted "extensive focus group research and opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's removal could help lift Obama's waning reelection hopes.
According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book details attempts by senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to assess the effect of former Secretary of State Clinton's appointment as vice president on the vote.
The possible replacement was a closely guarded secret in the Chicago campaign headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daly, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff - knew that a replacement was under consideration.
The book Doubling the Stakes claims that Daly initiated the attempt to replace Biden despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately backed down when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "substantially improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been actively speaking out for considering a lot of things, and this was one of them", he told the Daily.
You have to remember that at that moment the president was in terrible shape, so we were like, "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"
Although the Daily described the study as a "necessary check", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the campaign staff had invested a lot in studying whether the move would bring a dividend on the vote.
"Chairs don't spend that much money on polls and focus groups unless they're serious about something", Martin said on the AK 360 program.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking into the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked the Daily if his then-boss knew about the possible re-arrangement.
While the Daily said he didn't think the president was aware of a possible replacement, the former administration chief acknowledged that Obama may have been.
Martin added that "Double the stakes" doesn't give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political probing have reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed Obama was unaware of the study to remove Biden from the electoral roll.
"Perhaps", said Martin.
You want some glowing ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glowing ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop a glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific paper on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH of the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, that means the more you lick it, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me, I'm Tasty", says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still very early in the production, so for £200 you get about 2 grams of the stuff".
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it raises the pH and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect for Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish's luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each balloon costs me about £140.
It's pretty good, though.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of golden sesame.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to design invisible ice cream".
That's by definition impossible because of the fracture caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
"Avangard" coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the regular championship match of KHL against "Salavat", noted that the omics have conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that the "Avangarde" should pay more attention to the defensive game.
We watched the video of the match against the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website of "Avangard" the words of Chebaturkine.
- We missed a lot of shots, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of their failure to complete the game assignment.
We knew the rival had performers.
Statistically, they had five hits in one run, three of which we scored.
That's a very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparation for today's game?
Me and the boys, we're looking at every game, talking after the game, preparing for the next opponent.
The important thing is that the installation is done.
Everybody saw the first period of the match against Metalurg.
The game was being played, and the score was 2:0.
They missed the locker room goal and started to make mistakes in the third period.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in putting the defenders in.
We need to defend ourselves.
The Avangard have a long home series, games a day away, are they tired?
All teams are on equal terms.
The important thing now is to realize your moments and to complete the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the setup, it's not that hard.
Because of the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been standing in line at the Russian border for almost a week.
Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and bio-toilets
Hundreds of trucks piled up at the border checkpoints on the way into Russia.
This situation arose because of the change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is creating the queue, which did not warn in advance about the innovations.
Since October 28, the Russian customs authorities have begun to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Head of the Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is used in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
The checkpoints are operating in a heightened mode.
The FACTOS correspondent was at the border and talked to the truckers who were held hostage.
Prices at the roadside shop-cafe at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are rising every day, as are the queues of trucks.
The trucks are lined up in rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk - Veseli-Voznesenka customs terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine along the international highway.
From here the cargo is sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, they let them in before midnight, and then they introduced these rules, - complains Alexey Golovanev, a truck driver (photo), who transits through Russia to bring cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and a payment for the cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnias).
Those who go nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnias) and pass.
The rest of us are stuck. Nobody has that much money on them.
Imagine, if a driver carries a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border are nonexistent, complain truckers who have settled down to eat by their cars.
It's always expensive in the border shops and cafes, but we've never seen prices like this anywhere!
The sellers got their bearings and quickly took them: 15 hryvnias for a bat, seven hryvnias for a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias for a plate of soup.
There's only one coffee shop.
There's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet.
No washing or shaving...
I can't even get out of my car for a week, my wife's got me all set for the road.
A week long, another truck driver, Victor Skotarenko, comforts himself.
Will my car be ready in a week?
Why do you have a pint of water?
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a crystal bottle or silver-plated water?
We're a coffee shop, not a store.
"Take it while you have it", says the saleswoman.
After the situation was covered in the media, the authorities of the region drew attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The Amvrosiyevsky and Novoazovsky district state administrations have been instructed to provide drinking water to all those who are standing in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration, Sergei Dergunov.
There are ambulance crews at the checkpoints right now.
Biotubes will also be installed for the convenience of the people.
According to the official, the problem with the queues will be solved in the coming days.
As reported by the press service of the Donetsk regional state administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were parked at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk".
FACTS will be following the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to defame Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries , the state security department of the republic (DSB) told BNS.
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow is going to "talk" to Lithuanian President Dalu Grybauskaitė and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the special service, the preparation of the information attack is led by the Department of analysis of public processes of the Russian President's Administration on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also involved in the operation is allegedly a department employee named V. Smirnov.
According to the special service, Smirnov, under the guise of scientific work, regularly visited Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnoff is banned from entering the country.
The day before, Lithuania's president Grybauskaite said she knew about the information attack.
According to her, the main reasons are Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and the country's "pursuit of energy independence".
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She said that the Kremlin was "not respectful enough" of Lithuania.
In addition, Gribauskaitė accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of nominating Lithuania "only with demands".
In September, the Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
The quality of the products was not in line with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the Lithuanian leader declared that if Russia did not lift the ban, the government of the country should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, a school principal shot teenagers.
The headmaster of one American high school has been literally driven to despair by teenagers.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident happened in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw toilet paper at the man's home.
The school director opened fire on the teenagers, resulting in several injuries to a 15-year-old boy's leg and arm.
Since the bullies were not on the director's property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on $ 125,000 bail.
It should be noted that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest, California, U.S.A., right on a pedestrian street.
After that, the perpetrator took two random passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting was reported at a Newtown elementary school in Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
American school shooting: 14-year-old girl wounded
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to have candy, stay up late and do a masquerade for our neighborhood.
I'm more like a screwball now.
I haven't been called in to hand out candy in my apartment for the last two years, and I probably won't this year.
But the statistics show that I'm a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans - 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent on costumes will be spent on the product.
This year, the most popular items are the sexy inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual foods, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for the men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies with The Walking Dead, and I'm sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will be on our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet suits.
That means a lot of funny walking dogs.
When it comes to candy, we're not small.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey candy, candy bars, milk duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-seeking children who are poised to take over our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and not fool ourselves by eating 90 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is candy in the shape of corn kernels; and yet, according to the National Candy Association, almost 35 million pounds of candy is sold on Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn kernels.
It's a mystery I've yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the spirit of Halloween like a haunted house.
They have some great titles, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is actually a prison), "Shout and Scream" and "House of Shock".
In fact, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, and those amazing photos of you almost describing yourself that your friend posted on Facebook and you can't get rid of, and then the guy you like sees that photo and leaves a comment like, "cool facial expression".
And finally, we're going to talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's candle is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we've done since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, baby pumpkins didn't really take off until last year because of Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins instead of sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you want a more difficult task, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Estonian Defense Ministry website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense has been restored after the cyber attack this morning, the press service of the ministry reports.
According to the Vice Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs, Timur Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set things right, and the site is now back up and running.
"The damage to the ministry is minimal", Peterkop told the Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it's too early to say who orchestrated the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents completely", he admitted.
On November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted a message confirming the attack on the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense and opposing the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians don't want to die for the interests of NATO.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia as well.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We are for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine", Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the Feodosian Separate Battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps will take part in the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 command-staff exercises.
Due to the violence of the evil force, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in the southern province of Matabeleland, Zimbabwe, have been forced to close because of the attack on students by... goblins.
A local elder said that the children panicked and were unable to continue the study.
The goblin story may sound like a child's fairy tale to a European, but in Africa it's a pretty good argument for closing schools.
Adults are afraid of evil forces, too.
In Zimbabwe, for example, a hospital was closed during the summer because the hospital staff were also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover racing series announced

We are delighted to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as preparing participants for the harsh conditions and realities of rally-raid.
We've been very excited to develop the Defender Challenge car, which is going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces don't know anything about the Brotherhood
This is reported by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After reports appeared in the media that the US Treasury had placed Leps on the watch list for suspected membership in the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brotherhood', we searched all databases, but did not find such a group", the source said.
In his opinion, the spread of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As NI reported earlier, yesterday the US Treasury Department posted on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brotherhood".
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He's listed as "Grisha", posted the day before.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is given - Grigory Lepssevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
Besides Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another ex-Soviet expatriate whose citizenship is not specified.
The U.S. is certain that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was carrying money for the bandits on their orders.
This message is accompanied by a photograph of the singer and all his data, which corresponds to reality.
In fact, Leps did buy a house in Phuket recently.
The department said they intend to impose sanctions on Leps.
Putting a person on the US Treasury's blacklist means blocking his assets in the US and banning business contacts from people living in the United States.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the same Gregory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States".
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, he has not been personally notified, although I don't know if they do.
"And of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other hand - surprising and unexpected", she told RIA Novosti.
She says Gregory Leps doesn't live in Phuket, but the U.S. Treasury Department says he does have a house on the island in Thailand.
She said that Leps was on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught up with him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Running out on the field in the Shinnick game.
Some details about the personality of the fan, who ran out on the field during the match 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Sparta".
According to the head of the Russian Football Federation's Football Committee, Arthur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He's in custody at the moment.
"In addition, Grigoriants told how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this one, we will call him the spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance, the paramedic confirmed it.
And then he pushed two of his escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South stands to the corner of the East and North stands.
He ran across the field.
The flight attendants are responsible for that.
Until the Sports Act comes into force, this is a steward's zone - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the grandstand, climbed over the East Stand.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the running tracks", - said the head of the KDC.
We remind you that the decision of the KDC Moscow "Spartack" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against "Locomotive" and "Zenit", as well as pay a fine in the amount of 600 thousand rubles.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy who was trapped 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry.
Cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after getting in a minor car accident
Three days later, she was caught in the quarry by a man walking his dog.
Firefighters came down a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky to escape after fire crews were called to pick him up and take him to safety after he somehow got stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous slope of a steep slope.
A nine-month-old cocker spaniel, Ruby, ran away after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were frantically searching for their missing dog and posting on social media after she ran off to a quarry after a minor accident.
At approximately 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a keen dog breeder spotted Ruby stranded at 50 feet on a cliff in the quarry.
A technical rescue team from the Clackheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene, descended on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a tow truck to lift her up the hillside.
Rescue Specialist Officer Andy Clayton said she was in a dangerous position.
It was right in the middle of a steep slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate the cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue Specialist Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to be rescued.
There was a chance she might have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and they found that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to watch the rescue.
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing to have her back.
The vet said if she was fainted and passed out, she'd probably fall.
The fire department was great.
It was very brave what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson from Keatley added: "We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there".
The fire department was amazing.
I just can't believe she ended up there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star revealed that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and she noted, "He was playing with me when I was 18".
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind".
In a statement Thursday, Jagger, 70, said he "strongly denies" he ever hit for Katy Perry.
The spokesman added: "Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else".
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerwan: The break with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scarecrow about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the European Free Movement Area as a condition of EU membership.
There's a whole story about passport control in Berwick and the barbed wire border along Adrian's whale.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement across the rest of Europe, although  predictably  it didn't make the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member states spend a lot of time trying to twist their formal rules to their own convenience.
Since Scotland is not in the Schengen area now, continuing to not comply would be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a story worth telling.
And so old that it's become a fossil: I first heard the joke that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment that's lost in retelling an old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's orders?
Why trade the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or in favour of abolishing the euro as a single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany, founded just this year, came out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal election, effectively ousting the Free Democrats from the Bundestag.
There was always internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has been a watershed moment.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies by keeping the single currency, have led many people to think that the "Europe" project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments operating under excessive budget deficits,  this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has locked its members in exchange rates that are favorable to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe is in a precarious position in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way out is to cut wages and government spending, which Berlin actively supports.
The current budget and currency problems are underpinned by a deeper problem of Europe's productive capacity.
As a result of the complex of green energy measures implemented by Brussels, the cipher, which means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the US.
It's a cripplingly unfavorable price situation, as we've seen at Grangemouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
The result is a riot, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's shattered economy in a dire situation.
The result  Marine Le Pen's right-wing anti-EU party  National Front has just won a crucial by-election, pushing the ruling Socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote. A timely warning to British Labour that it is not possible to assume that the split on the right will automatically work in favour of the left.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If  and this is very likely  anti-EU parties gain support in this election, such a bloc could for the first time take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
My view is that the growing anti-EU and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will soon combine to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the vague Europe of nations that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several of its dependent economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I'm guessing that Britain is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests the likelihood that Britain will remain unnoticed in the cold Atlantic.
What does that leave Scotland in?
We can choose to become a region of (basically) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a freer European arrangement provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating the Norwegian experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is  strangely  the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity, having won an overwhelming majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence now just to accept the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, studies show.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is near
There's no evidence of hormones or other chemicals.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty.
The tendency to puberty is less pronounced in boys .
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheringe is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter starts to develop breast embryos and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent the new normal.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents, which usually doesn't mean I'm coming of age", Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there's been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"After the breasts start to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarchy", said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: how to deal with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate way to check how puberty is going to progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered premature when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may be the basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slower growth and shorter growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental level, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is wary of medication, but admits that "suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and girls' feelings that they are different from their peers".
The other big problem is obvious: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they're going to handle hygiene issues", Kaplovitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many theories promoted about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys and girls both reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the assumption that has the most weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls ages 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that although boys develop facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency to reach full puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goreeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy about getting advice from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This could mean an earlier than expected conversation", Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need reassurance that even when it happens earlier than expected, it's a normal part of life.
American Boeing is preparing to take off
The American aircraft, which has been observing Russia's territory under the Treaty on Open Skies and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday, will leave the city's air harbor on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time.
Airport officials have given the plane permission to leave after receiving fuel money.
According to the airport, the plane is going to Ulan-Ude.
Other reports say he's headed to the U.S.
It was reported that the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Transbaikal region due to fog.
He was not allowed out of Chita airport because of unpaid bills.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to go outside the Chita airport, they can only pass border control at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and involves 34 countries.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the USA, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of monitoring of the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, the expansion of the possibilities for the prevention of crises and the settlement of crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the deceased celebrities earn - MK in the US MK
The highest-earning living celebrity in 2013 was Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was spat out by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous earnings from October 2012 to October 2013 totaled $160 million.
He is far behind other retired celebrities who made several times less in the past year.
Elvis Presley was second on Forbes' list of the richest people to die - 55 million a year, and Peanuts comic book writer Charles Schulz was second with 37 million.
In addition, the top five were Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein also made the list.
Igor Gulyaev 's first boutique opened in Moscow
On October 23, the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyev was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now even more fashion fans will appreciate them - his first boutique finally opened in Moscow, which is why the designer threw a party in the style of dolce vita.
I'm sure that Russia has the most beautiful girls.
So I'm especially happy that I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's a part of me.
With these words, Igor cut the red ribbon and invited everyone to try the models!
Jet manufacturers are at loggerheads over seat width when big orders are at stake.
A fierce dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers, whose interests are not always at the centre of airlines' attention, with the amount of space allocated to them playing a key role in the claims about the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would require seat widths of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy cabins, but its main American competitor Boeing says that's for airlines to decide.
The dispute comes as aircraft manufacturers compete to sell larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with orders expected to be potentially record high at the November 17-21 event.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft  especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row  occupies a central place in the statements about the economic efficiency of new projects mini-aerobus.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will seat 406 people, based on economy class seating over 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats arranged in nine rows.
The giants of aircraft often exchange blows on technical issues through advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to lead the way with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war might be by showing a slide showing three people in a restaurant clinging to each other, titled "Would You Do It?"
Boeing offers long-haul flights with narrower seats than regional turboprops, said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
People are gaining weight with dietary changes, but airplane seats haven't changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century, the average American male aged 40 to 49 had gained 10 percent in weight, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist span of the average 21st-century American man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist span of what was recently called the "reactive public" was already.
Airbus says it commissioned a study that showed an extra inch in seat width improved sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' seat sizes and says manufacturers should not interfere with airlines' decisions on how to balance tariffs and amenities.
She said studies show that the comfort of a salon is not just about the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they need to do to succeed", said Kent Craver, Boeing's cabin specialist.
They don't want us to decide what's good for them.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this controversy is a race for aircraft orders estimated at least $700 billion at catalogue prices over the next decades  enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating arrangement is precisely what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jetliners.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent one-place gain in profitability on their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The Boeing's stated characteristics are based in part on comparing the 10-seat 777X rows with the original 9-seat configuration of the 777's design solution rows.
The profit in the specific cost is reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout used at present.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared to our designs", said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus's passenger comfort division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the full 10-seat cabins for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a more dense seating arrangement, which can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
"The 18-inch seats would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial standpoint, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777", said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World-traveling jet dealers even carry roulette wheels to check out competing layouts.
While boasting of comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very compact cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus is offering a 10-seat A350 but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider passenger spaces on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to take off, but it could divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may make smoking less pleasurable
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from lifelong nicotine addiction.
More tests are needed before human trials begin, which could take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York says the early results are encouraging.
"We are very hopeful that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry the genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine shock.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were then given nicotine, continued to function normally.
The mice that were not vaccinated were "relaxed", a sign that nicotine had reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, the injections had to be done so frequently that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the desire to try cigarettes, preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, it will be used by smokers to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't get the pleasure from the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of the habit", he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleinikov: one third of Moscow 's rural settlements fully subsidized
Vice-Governor of Moscow Region Yuri Oleinikov said that almost a third of the Moscow region's rural settlements are fully subsidized
The region's budget provides subsidies to 187 of the 288 settlements.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The proportion of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 percent are subsidies.
In the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are being allocated from the regional budget", Oleinikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytiš, Odintsovo and Pushkin - have a budget revenue of more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough".
The expenditure on the maintenance of local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of Moscow is over 70%, "while there is a decline in the quality of services", Oleinikov noted.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipal entities of Moscow region to think through until the end of November which settlements need to be enlarged, united into city districts or change the administrative management system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Before that, the governor of Moscow region stated that as part of the administrative reform in Moscow, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
There is also a request for the enlargement of municipalities in the Mozai, Kashir, Solnechnoyarsk, Kolomna, Lubertsa and Kotelnik districts.
The discussion of this issue in the regions' cities and districts will begin in November.
Moscow's parliamentary committee chairman Igor Brintsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 Moscow regions are planned to be united in the framework of the upcoming admreform.
This is because of the fact that out of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 have a subsidy base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she derives from raising her children.
Although Arbenina is now particularly active in her work and community, she still finds opportunities to hang out with Martha and Artem, not only spending time with them for their education, but also for entertainment.
Diana has twice in the last week testified to her fans about her teaching talents.
First, she posted a picture on Facebook of herself teaching children to read.
And yesterday, she delighted her fans by showing them how she dressed Artem and Martha for Halloween.
"We're ready for the broomstick race! Our first Halloween!" Diana called the photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are involved in this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "indefinite gender" in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born to hermaphrodites with the gender of the child being "indefinite".
The child's parents will have the right to leave the gender column of the birth certificate incomplete for a period of time.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents may temporarily write "X" (indefinite).
This decision is intended to prevent parents from rushing into sex-determination surgery.
Statistics show that one in every 2,000 newborns in the world is born a hermaphrodite.
Tripod denies being under the influence of Obed.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodie will be the subject of an investigation by the state's anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripody denies any changes to the lease of the waterfront properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obed, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeyde lobbied several state ministers to extend the lease on Cercle Key, where the Obeyde family owns two restaurants and cafes, without going through a tender after their term expired in August 2005.
She's now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripoddy knew about Mr. Obed's secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripoddy's former deputy chief of staff Lynn Ashpool on Thursday.
For several years of discussions, beginning in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for an open competition.
The landlords were against it and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the enterprises on the Serkyullar Key, which brought the Obedov family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without being put out to open competition.
Mr. Tripodie, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obed, who, as Mr. Tripodie admitted, was urging changes to the government's rental policy.
The ICAC-presented transcript of the phone calls was a record of conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obed, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the ports ministry after working under Mr. Obed in the fisheries department.
"Was the issue discussed in these phone conversations the issue of the development of commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley to Mr. Tripody.
"No", said Mr. Tripoddy.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but he said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile cargoes inside Syria.
Foreign workers on 457 subclass visas can be tested for authenticity
The 457 visa "authenticity test" is under consideration by the government as it seeks to expand the crackdown.
This test, if passed, will be used to prevent the use of 457 visas to fill unqualified positions or as a loophole for family and friends to move to Australia.
The government's paper was published today, as former Labour MP Maxine McKeo criticized the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners at the end of the line' and 'Australians first' are a very unpleasant throwback to the days when unions demanded a protected labour market", she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this has meant that white labor was the one that needed to be protected, and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document presented to the committee sets out 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he is meeting with officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the others are under consideration.
If the authenticity criteria are accepted, the applicant for a visa can be examined to see if the application is genuine if the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of holders of the 457 subclass visas, as previously businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers would then hire hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying refugees to Christmas Island this week.
His grieving nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by his cousin, who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamov's said that the hockey player is suffering from alcoholism
Friend of hockey player Semen Varlamov, Yevgenia Vavrinuk, said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking", the woman said.
Recall that Vavrinuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
She said the hockey player pulled her by the hair and beat her, injuring her arms, chest, stomach and neck.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on $5000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athletes' movements around the country, but prohibited them from approaching Wawrinuk.
He's also facing up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic effect for Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project envisages the opening of a high-speed link with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of Stage One in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project would "unite Britain".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" by the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Stage Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements to rail capacity and reducing journey times for Northern England and Scotland.
That should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim with HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer together".
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we'll face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it's also about connecting cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better connections with HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown has called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: 'High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK'.
So we're excited to be working with the UK government to explore options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all, and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to discussing the results of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Thorium is the new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world are still thinking about how to meet their energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where they exist) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy requires large areas to generate.
Nuclear power is costly, but it leaves behind a lot of expensive waste.
Recently, scientists have turned their attention to thorium, another radioactive element in the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and experts say that its decomposition leaves no waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
The rules for using electronic devices on Australian aircraft will remain in place for now .
Passengers on Australian airlines will still need to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite the US easing regulations on these devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which has required American airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were reviewing the claim, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Board currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft", it said.
This is governed by rules which require air carriers to maintain safety at all times and passengers to observe safety rules which are communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already been discussing with the Civil Aviation Safety Administration the expansion of its onboard Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not against the changes but said it would follow the regulator's guidance.
"We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Administration's consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it's on our planes", the spokesperson said.
Qantas has stated that it will adhere to the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no plans to change that anytime soon", she said.
The FAA's order applies to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be looking closely at the FAA decision and the reasons that led to it.
For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, and review manuals, training materials, hand luggage rules and passenger instructions.
After the airline checks and confirms the resilience of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude,  the FAO said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, the group recommends that heavier devices be placed under seats or in the upper luggage compartment during takeoff and landing.
The head of Dagestan sounds extremist in the anthem of Kuban
The football match between "Angi" and "Kubany" turned into a political collision between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kubany sounded differently.
Dagestan's head of state Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday suggested that republican parliamentarians go to court because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly calls for ethnic strife, in particular, calls for war with "basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, which was adopted in our time in 1995.
It's a disgrace, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you here, as a mother, as an enemy, as a basurman, we are going to a death fight" - for which such words are recorded in the anthem, to poison some believers on other believers", - expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov the chairman of the parliament Hizri Shikhsaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from overseas, namely, from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles that were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that would allow the US not to conduct a military operation, which they approached closely this summer.
More on the weapons and what they mean for the Syrian president, will be provided by our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from the poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal brokered by Assad's friend, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is a milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had shut down its claimed chemical weapons manufacturing plants.
The more long-term and difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We understand that's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to go.
But Assad is staying.
And it makes me feel even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and ill-armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to feed on leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons deal is being called a success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of being a cooperative man.
The US ambassador to Syria had to answer some tough questions in Washington today.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly relieved that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is holding out.
And he's trading weapons for power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry that would oversee construction and housing and offers to head it to ex-Ivanovsk region governor Mikhail Menyu in a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novo-Ogaryevo, and Men did not refuse to lead the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Mikhail Men - son of the famous Orthodox priest and archpriest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995 began his political career - he was elected to the Moscow regional Duma from Sergiev-Posad district, was a deputy of the State Duma, first vice-premier of the government of the Moscow region, vice-premier of the government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanov region.
The pawnbrokers in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is struggling
At a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemir Mall, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there", says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  is such that ValueMax, where it trades, has become the third pawnshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
A jewelry mortgage is not only a quick way to get money (S$1300 in Ms. Amirthaling's case), but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%  slightly above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
So millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by rising living costs and the rapidly rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit, fueled by loose monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for declining incomes as their economies slow down.
This week Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, cited the increase in household lending, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-GDP ratios in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
Thursday's data showed continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower end [of the income scale] will look for ways to supplement their income wherever they can", says Song Seng Won, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices in the last two years have intensified the rush people are in to pawn their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to make money off their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items that are pawned at 200 pawnshops in the city-state are gold items.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's bet on Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month".
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The growth in the wholesale business is such that ValueMax, which operates a branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's CEO.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the Singapore Stock Exchange's IPO.
While some lenders have drawn fire from criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Yeach says that the pawnbroker not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, he also does not directly increase debt.
"Clients mortgage items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn't increase household debt", she says.
The trust is gaining wider public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secure financing.
And it's not just the people who are in a tough financial situation who use the pawnshop.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, pledging gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties", says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money real fast.
Today, the population is concerned not with the number of medical facilities available or their status, but with the quality of the care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernisation of healthcare in the Tula region for 2011-2013", reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure for providing medical assistance to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and women who are giving birth.
For example, after the merger with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the "NGKB" State Health Center for consultations with pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, modern equipment corresponding to world standards appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the renovation of the premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased for 42 million rubles.
The intensive care unit for newborns is equipped with the latest equipment.
In the operating room, the C-section is performed using the Cell-Sever apparatus, which allows blood to be collected from the operating wound and returned to the mother after special treatment, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
The clinical-laboratory diagnostics department is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women's clinic has an electronic registration system, and it is planned to introduce electronic maps and patient medical records in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it is now possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, women who are giving birth and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechen nationals arrested by French police on suspicion of serial assaults on prostitutes.
The investigation began in March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the Caucasians' actions.
The gang reportedly ordered prostitutes into one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then beat and robbed them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old woman from Chechnya who had been convicted.
The defender of "Bavaria" David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he has outperformed representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by mountain skier Marcel Hirsher, and the third - by ski jumper Gregor Shlirenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the German Cup and the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavin 's ex-wife is vacationing with actor Andrei Chadov
The former civil wife of the Peterborough "Zenit" footballer Andrei Arshavin, Yulia Baranovskaya, is spending her vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Yulia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zaporozhny, her fiancé - figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos of the couples' walks were posted on Anastasia Zarozhna's Instagram.
This isn't the first time Andrey and Julia have been photographed together.
On October 5, Zorozhnaya published a photo of the couple embracing on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarov.
In mid-October, Zenit's vice president Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives apart from his civil wife, Yulia.
We'll remind you, Yulia Baranowska and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
It's been reported recently that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new friend was married to a top corporate executive.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmania health
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania's crippled health system be supplemented by strict conditions that ensure the state government does not waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic limitations.
The decision to fund the four-year programme was taken after consultation with the government and independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state", Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes a $31 million blitz campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for the open-access clinics in Hobart and Lonsay, for improving post-hospital care, training for health professionals, mental health services and introducing personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
"This investment will go towards the implementation of ideas from leading doctors on how to better support Tasmania's healthcare system", said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would operate in a strict accountability and accountability mode.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million is not going to solve anything unless it is followed by genuine reforms that put Tasmania's healthcare system on a more sustainable footing.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for emergency assistance, which he first addressed to the prime minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid package will make a significant contribution to bringing this state's health care system out of its critical state", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional selection procedures largely compensate for recent cuts.
But opposition federal health official Peter Dutton believes today's statement is a solution similar to a plaster cast.
"The reason we're here is because the state's Labor government has squeezed $430 million out of the health care system", he told ABC TV.
When the state government is pulling in almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth is putting in 300 million, you can't pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton has asked Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout will be spent on additional red tape.
Guillaume Nickle's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot may boast exceptional staging and historical detail, but it is also more difficult to interpret than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of the sadist-mistress and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
A film never goes down to obscenity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, storytelling risks becoming a sort of moisture-laden test for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, observers say
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as fierce clashes raged in the north near one of the sites believed to be holding toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in the country nearly three years ago.
The chemical weapons ban statement was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "disable" all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms that allow chemicals to be mixed with poison gas and filled with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is a milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of the equipment means Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The statement was made during fierce fighting on Thursday in the town of Safir, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons facility and storage site, according to the Britain-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
The activist group, which has been tracking casualties through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, as mentioned, 61,067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, as the statement said, were 2202 army defectors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a UN estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
That figure hasn't been updated since.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting in Safir for weeks with rebels, many of whom are linked to Al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are pressed by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team was "now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all of Syria's declared critical production facilities and blending/fueling equipment".
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections, visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two sites for security reasons, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned" and... the chemical weapons program items in them were moved to other stated locations that were being checked.
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safir was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
"I salute the courage and bravery that you all have shown in carrying out the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken", said the director general of the monitoring group, Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year in a row, the civil war has pitted the mostly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are made up of members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shi'ite Islam.
As for other events, the center's head, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a major explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the verdict against the organisers of the Bali terror attack
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict handed down to the last of the conspirators who appeared in court, and declared that Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly a decade on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He could be out for 15 years if he gets parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including the Christmas Eve bombings of churches across Indonesia in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment, though they could insist that a man nicknamed "the subversive" for his reputation as a master of making explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision has compounded the painful memories of Perth-based mother June Courtine, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
She barely held back her tears, saying that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He needs to be put on the firing squad, Ms. Courtine told the AAP.
I have to live every day knowing that I will never have grandchildren again and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was placed in a parked van outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he went into a coma for a month and died three times while on life support.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek must share the fate of the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the bloodshed, Amrozi, Mukhlass and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
That guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
Saving his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds isn't that much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the Bali terror attack to appear in court.
He went into hiding for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent revealed that intelligence evidence indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up", said Mrs. Courtine.
Until recently, he had no regrets about the pain he caused others.
The sentence comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be commemorated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year", says Mrs. Courtine.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from mobile phones) 
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on their mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAA administrator Michael Werth said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation rules to meet the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of electronic devices very soon", the FAO said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain says "goodbye".
Passengers must turn their devices off again when the plane descends for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and takeoff, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleeding, president of the Association of Professional Airline Pilots, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we're going to work closely with the carrier to achieve that), it will be a win-win", Gliding said.
We're frankly tired of feeling like we're on school duty when it comes to this.
But connecting to the Internet for surfing, emailing, texting or downloading data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So there's still no word on the smart internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the actor was taken off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn the device off while the plane was at the landing gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still need to fit in the trunk, because they could injure someone if they're flying around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls on the flight will also remain prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission has the regulatory authority over phone calls, not the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air", said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAO to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been mounting on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no good reasons for the bans, which are related to safety.
It is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce restrictions as the use of devices becomes more widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers  high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Werth.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals at a much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when pages are flipped.
But the signals become more powerful as the devices load or send data.
Among those who have pushed for easing restrictions on passenger electronic devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-book readers and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAO advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes the interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports from pilots confirming that the devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off their devices during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry representatives welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a multitude of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security", said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Autoschools will be able to conduct driving test
Private companies with their own computerised car park will be able to take the driving test.
This is reported by Kommersant, citing the draft government resolution "On the permit to drive vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are only about 30 such roads in Russia today.
It is assumed that pupils of such "privileged" driving schools will be counted for the results of internal testing.
The State Auto Inspectorate will monitor the passing of the exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the placement of students fail the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the motorways contained in the draft Government Resolution come into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for teaching two-wheeled vehicles to drive.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass the exam in the city to obtain the A-category rights.
In addition, from 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign licenses.
Such workers will have to get Russian visas after passing the exam.
Bird airlifted to safety from a drilling rig in the North Sea released back into the wild
A bird that was airlifted ashore after being found in a depleted state on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
This water herder was put on a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month, and then taken out by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloah.
Centre manager Colin Sedon said: "This water heron is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has landed in the high wind zone over the North Sea".
It looks like the bird got exhausted and found shelter in the oil tower.
He added: "She was unable to take off again, so we were called in for help".
The water herder was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring business together and identify what changes the UK's wealth and job creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to give their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders representing a broad cross-section of UK businesses by size, sector and region.
The results of the poll will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives stating that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European trade area, with even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreeing.
The latest and most telling  our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority want the UK to pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "significant change" that will return power back to the UK.
High stakes  Achieving a change in the treaty and more favourable terms for the UK would ensure a 16 per cent swing in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that businesses expect the review to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British businesses are possible and increasingly necessary as the euro area embarks on a path of closer economic and financial integration.
Jobs and economic growth in the UK must be given priority, and as our survey shows, for business this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes to the way Brussels regulates.
U.S. intelligence is tapping the personal phone of the Pope
The Vatican's activities are under the watchful eye of American intelligence.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that US intelligence has been listening in on all the previous Pope Benedict's talks, and is now closely watching Pope Francis.
His phone was tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under surveillance.
Which was a big deal in the US.
The Secret Service tapped the cell phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to elect the next pope.
The telephones of the residence where the participants lived were also tapped.
American spies have been listening to all the major contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of a figure undesirable to Washington.
Panorama magazine reports that the "large ear of the United States" continued to intercept the prelates' conversations until the very end of the conclave on March 12.
It is claimed that in the United States since 2005 the Argentinian archbishop Bergolio has been selected as the future Pope of Rome.
American intelligence also delayed negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that the U.S. Embassy in Rome continues to have a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives working on policy and financial flows.
The Vatican, for its part, has conciliatorily declared that it does not care about the American "tapping", even if it is happening.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
Snowboarder photographed for Olympic coin
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative note to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bills is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already making a lot of irony about the commemorative note.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they noticed that the image of a snowboarder on the bill can be found in photo banks.
In particular, in the free stock exchange photo archive, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobzhor on January 18, 2011.
It has also been used in RugGear smartphone ads.
The Olympic banknotes are in blue-blue.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Jar-bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - ski mountaineering, freestyle skiing and trampoline jumping, but in the end they chose snowboarding, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public's opinion regarding the widespread distribution of the image of the snowboarder on the Olympic bill and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznac, they're not too concerned about the noise around the Olympic bill.
The head of the press service of the State Sign, Natalia Nikiforova, told "Izvestia" that all the arguments regarding plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the bill will turn right, on the photos in the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
The person in the photo shoot was photographed from different points of view, and then the final image was chosen, which is the characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic bill, as the artist received a salary for the work.
Experts say the debate over the image on the Olympic coin is positive.
Recognition of the image on the note is a plus for its promotion, - says the executive director of the Russian Brands company, Alexey Popovichov.
It's difficult to prove that the images on the bill are 100% the same as those in the photo bank, so it's unlikely that the lawsuits will be filed to challenge the intellectual property rights of the image.
The first Olympic banknotes appeared in China - a 10 yuan commemorative note was issued for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to uphold this tradition.
Legislative bans have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
They predict that beer consumption in the country will remain at the same level next year, and that's for the best.
Although businessmen were initially hoping for growth.
This year is not a good year for them: sales have fallen by 7 percent.
This was reported by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Trade of daily demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, as the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a small alcohol content, - Sheps told the audience.
No country in the world has such strict restrictions on the beer market, with unpredictable new and irrational bans that are supposedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that many of the legislative prohibitions designed to reduce alcohol abuse are not having much effect, yet new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The biggest blow to beer producers came from the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks, which has been in place since this year.
"We lost 35,000 customers in one go", said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two forecasts for next year.
The optimistic one is the one that Shepse was talking about: foam drink sales will stay the same.
Pessimistic - fall another 2-3 percent.
To keep their profits, businessmen are forced to move from mass-consumer to premium beer: beer will be less but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, the drastic impact of a drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol is yet to be seen.
"My observations show that the rate of alcoholism remains at about the same level", said drug specialist Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who use substitutes for hard drinks and those who "sit" on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like "Jaguar" has increased, whereas a decade ago it was beer alcoholism that was dominant.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolodsk.
The unions say all the fired have been paid.
However, far more acute than the problems of workers is the issue of reducing industrial production in the region.
The deputy of the regional Zaks Aleksey Etmanov at the meeting said that the factory of the company "Ford" in Vsevolodsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then, according to the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the factory.
Workers who decided to quit voluntarily were offered "gold parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left their jobs of their own accord.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I think it's not just that.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any support programs for regional enterprises in difficulty in the next two years", he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the great reduction of jobs.
Ford has neither confirmed nor denied this information.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it comes, we'll be sure to publish it.
Talks about cutting workers at Ford's plant in Vsevolodsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to lay off 600 people were announced in September.
The plant had previously announced that it was suspending production of cars.
The factory cited the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia as the cause.
According to Petrostat, in the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Lenoblast decreased by 5.4%.
Transportation and equipment production fell by 11.5%.
In the US, you can use your cell phone during takeoff and landing.
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with the new rules set to take effect by the end of 2013.
However, internet access to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will still be prohibited.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that they can handle the alleged impact of mobile phones on aircraft equipment and controls.
According to the source, the UK may also be revising the current regulations on the use of electronic devices in flights, following the example of the US.
The Russian mafia in the United States has finally gotten a new name - the Brotherhood.
This week, the blacklist of the Russian mafia in America has been expanded with new names and four new companies.
The US Treasury Department has admitted three Russian representatives, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli to the "Brotherhood Circle".
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, who is suspected by the US of carrying money for the group's members.
The U.S. has 22 people on the Fraternal Circle blacklist, along with six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization really exists.
"The claim of the 'Brotherhood' is more like an attempt to unite the scattered criminal groups", said organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti earlier.
In his opinion, the "Brotherhood" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization", Mr. Galeotti is quoted as saying by the U.S. Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti is also joined by Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University.
"If they are working together, it is more like a criminal network than an organization", she is quoted as saying by the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In mid-last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brotherhood was a group of close associates of Russian thief-in-law Aslan Ussoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
For example, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zachary Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandfather Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandfather Hasan's nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some of the individuals are not related to Ussoyan.
He said they were all linked by financial and criminal interests, such as drug trafficking from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - in the "Brotherhood Circle" attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why he was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Lips) is a Russian citizen.
Like all Russian citizens, his interests will be protected.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
"Today marks a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the whole European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia's gas destined for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "for good".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced price once the entire project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission has learned.
Two YMCA NSW staff were accused of sexual offences against children before charges were brought in 2011 against Caringbach childcare worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse reported.
But the commission's opening statement said that it "has never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization".
Chief Executive Philip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another where a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Ferness, the attorney assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but he didn't know about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA in the opening speech to the commission also allowed for inaccuracy, claiming that there were external audits of the YMCA that acknowledged that the YMCA was at the forefront of ensuring child safety.
The commission's evidence suggests that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second-best of four possible ratings from a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management made mistakes in hiring Lord, and failed to ensure staff had a clear understanding of their obligations to report violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the suggestion that YMCA's corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord's child safety violations.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, personally caring for them, putting them on his lap, saying he loved one of them, and allowing them to play with his cell phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's guidance and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child welfare manager at the YMCA in Caringbach, who was Lord's guide, "very scary and often difficult to reach".
The CEO said he didn't accept the employees' explanations about how they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord distracted them from the need to report him.
Mr. Hare said he had presented to the New South Wales YMCA board his view that the lesson for the organization from the Jonathan Lord incident did not involve the provision of information by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were filed was made by YMCA's General Director of Child Custody Liam Whitley.
He said it was to prevent evidence from being tampered with, but that it was over-exaggerated and poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe place for children during the time Jonathan Lord worked there from 2009 to 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone, a child abuse expert at Griffith University.
He said there were "serious problems" with recruitment, selection, training, training and supervision.
The hearing is adjourned until December 20th.
Fashion week in São Paulo.
She is not just a model in her home country, but a star.
Although Giselle Bundchen had left her job for a while to focus on motherhood, she came to the show on these days and this week.
Her absence for many months did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the podium.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel in the world.
This time she was in the Kolchi brand parade.
The fashion week finale is usually the most interesting show.
It looks like it was designed by the stylist Lino Villaventura.
The brand has been around for over 30 years, and in parallel with the production of luxury pret-a-porter, the fashion designer is active in the theatre and cinema, designing performances and designing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the closing fashion week in São Paulo.
It is one of the fastest growing industries, employing more than 2 million Brazilians and generating annual revenues of $50 billion.
Tony Blair has said he will take the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admits that a return is unlikely.
In an interview on the eve of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since retiring in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his commentary to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East Peace Keeping Quartet.
Asked if he would return as prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely that will happen, so ... "
The head coach of Milan, Massimiliano Allegri, expressed regret over the draw in the 10th round of the Italian championship against Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries to the leading players.
I'm very sorry that we didn't win, Tmw quotes Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good chances.
We didn't allow anything in the first half for Lazio.
The second one, the Romans added, but overall, I can't say we've lost focus.
We should have won.
Last season, we accomplished the task of reaching the Champions League.
We're behind schedule right now, but that's due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But we're still good.
Look at Kaka, who's had a high-level meeting.
The experts in the horse racing events coming to Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award knew the competition would be very fierce.
But no one was ready for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet a schoolboy, but only a few months into his first step, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony Toffee the Red, raced through three rounds to easily take the top prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair of identical heights have been highly commended for their looks, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybenk equestrian centre in the town of Radry near Cardiff.
Standing in front of a crowd of men and women in fancy boiler hats, he moved his hat to the side and proudly led the two-year-old Toffee around.
The judges praised Fenton for his unusually developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his looks and his character.
Fenton was given a Toffee for his third birthday last March, and he's been riding a Shetland pony every day since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said Fenton and Toffee make a beautiful duo.
They had a lot of rivals, but these two walked away with the gold cup and the rose.
It was only his second performance with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Some complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This boy from the village of Nantinglo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Mrs Howells said: "The audience was amazed, and everyone shouted applause and applause".
He ran across the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did his job well.
Fenton is crazy about animals  he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens that he takes care of.
Judging by the way he started, he's going to be a horse of the year soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A representative of this annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony".
Together they make a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffee for their looks and for the way they presented themselves on the show ring.
They're judging the pony and breeder's performance. Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he looked really good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the appeal is to be reorganized
A Chinese newspaper that published a front-page call for the release of a defamation reporter should be reorganized, the press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false stories about a state-owned company.
Now the new express has to go through a complete error-correction process, the regulator says.
The "correction" order came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Department.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group's newspaper New Express published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The management of the New Express was disoriented", the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that it has been decided to "impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yunzhou in the form of revoking his reporter's license".
He also  instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct the mistakes in the New Express completely and recommended that it investigate the situation with regard to the newspaper's responsible persons and immediately make changes to the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express, claiming financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page calls for his release, saying it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television to admit that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn the trust of the public", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express published an apology on the front page, saying the paper failed to properly verify his reports.
Several high-ranking suspects recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of whipping confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to confess.
A U.S. Mexico drug-trafficking tunnel equipped with its own railroad was discovered.
One of the most complex drug-smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described this four-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages they've ever discovered.
The zigzag tunnel, which is nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is crawling with hidden warehouses, making it easier to smuggle drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was sealed before any drugs were smuggled through, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when they discovered the tunnel.
Three men, who law enforcement officials say were drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several large tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after the October marijuana harvest, which put drug cartels on a challenging task of quickly delivering their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passageway about 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks, that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus , pensions are increasing from November
In Belarus, pensions are being increased since November this year, the head of the Pension Security Department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection told the correspondent of BELTA.
From November 1 of this year, the average salary of employees in the republic, which was used during the previous recalculation of pensions, will be adjusted by increasing its amount by 5.4% and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be carried out in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 "On the increase of pensions".
As a result of the recalculation, from November onwards, the age pension will increase by an estimated 5.3%.
The average pension for the elderly will be Br2 million .
The pension increase will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November of this year will increase by Br274,3 billion per month.
At the same time as the re-calculation of the labour pensions, in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, the surcharges, the increases and the supplementary payments to pensions will be re-calculated in connection with the increase of the budget of the subsistence minimum per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 530 thousand - 2.1% higher than the one in effect from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum pension, social pension and the allowances, increases and additions to pensions will be increased by 2.1% from 1 November.
In Belarus , the payment of pensions with the increase in 2013 is over Br53 trillion .
British police handed Assange an extradition notice
British police today handed over a extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a "formal surrender order" to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at the police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has handed over to the 40-year-old man a formal surrender order requiring him to report to the police station on a day and time of our choice, a spokesman said.
He's still violating his parole.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-secret website WikiLeaks.
Driver driving 130mph with hot drink between his legs fined £1,000
The driver was fined £1000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howey, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink between his legs.
In Colchester Common Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
Adding seven penalty points to his driver's license led to his receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and an additional £100 in compensation to victims of crime.
A tax on foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst.
The Treasury has completed a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who introduced a 7 per cent state duty rate for homes worth over £2 million in the 2012 budget and annual payments for buyers who choose to own homes in partnership rather than as individuals.
At the moment, the state duties on residential property in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceed the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook stated: After the increase of the State duty on expensive houses and the related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.
"But this move could lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy property in London or current owners not wanting to sell it", he added.
The value of prime real estate  the top 510% of the market for affordable housing  in London's affluent south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady increase of 5.6% year-on-year, but were overshadowed by the rapidly developing domestic market, with prices surging in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs wag their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while anxious dogs wag their tail predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice these subtle differences in tail wagging and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigar, a neuroscientist at Trent University, says: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are different in the way they produce the stimulus that causes positive or negative emotions".
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of their brain controlling the left side of their body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the varied tail curls of other dogs, researchers observed animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the heartbeat of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon find out why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.
Professor Valortigar said, "We showed the dogs a video of the dogs, either a naturalistic version or a silhouette, to get rid of any other distortion factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or to the right".
When the animals saw that the otherwise expressionless dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging tail dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was tilted mostly to the left (back from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Valortigar said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other by these movements.
He actually thinks that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried about and what they shouldn't.
He observes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and frequent tail-winding is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right-hand side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on this experience".
The researchers say that these results could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their pet's emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's veterinary school, said this was not the first study to test whether left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads left when they look at an aggressive dog, and right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was curled to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious, "the opposite of the Italian study".
He said the differences could be because dogs in different studies didn't fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is ample evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes in different mammals, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we'll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes  in the other.
Arctic Monkeys are postponing their Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys have postponed a Glasgow concert after their lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was supposed to play at the Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, vocalist Alex Turner's illness forced them to postpone the show.
The band's statement came after it was forced to postpone a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: Following the decision to postpone the show at Birmingham's LG Arena tonight and following a medical appeal, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow's Hydro venue on Friday 1 November.
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately, he is unable to perform.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, with a show in Glasgow at the Hydro venue on 21 November.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will make new cardinals for the first time in his tenure on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest priesthood in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80 as a cardinal, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope  this is the prerogative of a group of 120  cardinal-electors.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the consistory, would be held before the ordination ceremony.
"Pope Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as he needs to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Next year's consistory will be of great significance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance", he said.
Forty percent of Catholics in South America are represented by a tiny number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals elected since Francis's Council of Cardinals formed a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who are tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made all the decisions for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would seek the cardinals' advice.
But we've never been in a situation like this before. This is all for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually make bishops of the major parishes cardinals, but Francis is full of surprises, so we don't know who he's going to name.
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the U.S. for seatback repairs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address problems with manual seatback tilt, according to a Friday notice from U.S. auto safety regulators.
Some of the pickups may have a defect in the front seat's back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet federal standards for headrest safety.
"When a car is hit from behind, the head rest may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury", says a notice posted on the National Traffic Safety Administration website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
Production of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch into series production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM notified the truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider a notification to owners due to the 16-day government shutdown that slowed the growth of car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The scream of desperation of Obama's voters
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope that change could happen.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to derail the laudable effort.
Obstructionism cannot justify the problems with the Obama health care reform website, the drone attacks.
The Obama 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a really sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me during my second year of medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It's called "Courage to Win", and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patient reports at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take the breath away.
The election victory was impressive, and the news programming paused to make sense of this historic moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was coming to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his approval rating was 82%.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a rough awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism. They seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I give Obama credit for his great and varied accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to pulling our troops out of Iraq to repealing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy to killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health options, and the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, among others.
But after countless times, when I've stood by the Obama administration, defending it to my colleagues and peers, I'm running out of explanations to give.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain the permission to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or the drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It can't explain the NSA's collection of American privacy data or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing.
He can't explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without a trial and investigation or the failure to comply with the limits of state funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusion that the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive" since the Nixon administration.
And lately, he can't justify not being able to develop a simple website more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that leadership could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, running for office is not a predictable agenda, because our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and by random events like the Newtown massacre.
However, from all the examples I have given above, it is clear that they were largely the choice of the administration itself.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was so enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a vague and crude alternative, and he seemed incapable of making a decision about his own politics or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, free from the pressures of the upcoming election, would live up to the hopes we've been hearing about for so long.
However, with Obama's rating this week down below 45 percent, going back to 2008 with this book is much harder.
It makes me miss so many promises that have gone unfulfilled.
This week I read the section of the book that describes how Clinton dealt Obama a stunning defeat in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a failure analysis meeting, he told his employees that they should get back on track and stay true to their purpose.
"I want us to get our charm back", he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, I agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris alone.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the issue of childcare leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unresolved dispute over a $6 million carbon tax payment, made this statement at a time when he was trying to dodge questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's united party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to eliminate taxes on carbon emissions and mining.
But Mr. Palmer maintained that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest in whether or not they get the leave", Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the contest for the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax County with a 53-vote majority after the vote was counted.
Mr. Palmer has called for a review of the voting process in the election to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after we vote?
"We need to have a more perfect system", he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you can come in, enter your data into your computer, vote right away, and get the results at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil in this day and age seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would be "very serious" about his new job.
A public office involves service to the community.
"We are not seeking any awards other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment", he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency operations unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, further confirming that the global scrutiny of alleged currency manipulation by regulators is gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the ongoing investigation, which has been linked to the LIBOR manipulation scandal.
While declining to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, insiders said RBS had passed on the record of emails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the UK's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is reportedly being granted leave from his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, took a leave of absence this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from his job by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Asher's instant messaging contacts included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the people in the room.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies around the world  The European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust watchdog Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal audits or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are looking at instant messages and emails over the years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news of the checks has stirred traders in the industry, which has been one of the biggest sources of income for investment banks' trading units in recent years, but this year has faced difficulties as low currency volatility reduces opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the situation by saying that the vast and highly liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that's not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of banks' own internal platforms means that you can start to influence the market at a very low price.
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it was firing one of its traders from its London Stock Exchange this week after causing losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has notified the relevant authorities immediately and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this matter was localized", Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama 's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a 5-4 vote, the judges ruled that separate provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional under the government's taxing powers.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were against.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the health care law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or lose all federal Medicaid funding was not unconstitutionally binding.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by every major Republican presidential candidate during the 2012 primary election season, including the presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the rift?
In the State Duma, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it is a game that causes scandals and quarrels.
Speaker Sergey Narishkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that to reduce "the degree of tension in society" politicians and the media should be correct in their statements.
I think he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if the population was not restricted...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples living in Russia, which gave the discussion a sense of ambiguity.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev were "a model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and instances answering these questions", and seven babysitters have an eyeless child.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practiced with migrants, according to the public figure, has failed, and we need to find our way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified history textbook.
"We need to create a textbook on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa", he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for "calls to dismember Russia": "If in the USA say on the radio that you should give Alaska to Russia, then you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "fire up".
As usual, he blamed journalists for bringing sick and acute national issues to the public debate: "In the heat of the polemic, there is little to say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasilyev, advised journalists to sign a "charter" and agree to talk about this topic carefully, and then politicians can take on the same obligations.
We have about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
He cited as an example a law that places responsibility for interethnic peace on regional and municipal authorities.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm about this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what migrants' adaptation is, about its mechanisms and limits.
So, the parties will have different interpretations of the scope of these powers.
Besides, the municipalities do not have the necessary personnel to solve such complex issues, they do not have the resources, and the methodological recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them...
The head of the Duma's Committee on Nationalities, Hajmet Safaraliyev, proposed to create a special department with the ominous name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who headed a similar agency in the 1990s, opposed the move.
All you need is a special person at the federal level, a "minister without portfolio", who you can turn to if you need to.
"We are walking along the edge, shells are being torn nearby, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive a worthy informational support", said the representative of the ROC for relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
He believes that the state should not be neutral in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to be sought, but they are pushed in the wrong direction, not on that road", he said.
"Not the way" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten by the crowd, the flags are burned, the teammates throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby.
"There will be no equal in the world in this sport!" - said the headmaster.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You'll even curl them!
You have to know the national characteristics, it's like offering the Georgian "Zaporozets""...
In Yaroslavl, the representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves with wild behavior on the stands - during a game with a local club.
Football will have to be banned nationwide...
The head of the RFK's disciplinary committee, Artur Grigoryants, said that the "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports the correspondent of "SE" Philip PAPENKOV from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stand during the home match of the 14th round against "Anji".
There were representatives of both clubs at the meeting, a man from the RFPL.
We've gone through all the materials we can find.
For the unlawful behavior of the audience, Kuban was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei are being sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's former patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, which it cut its price at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, filed patent infringement lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match keywords in an Internet search to the relevant advertisements, the lawsuit says, which is the foundation of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running on Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel patents for an initial price of $900 million.
Google raised the price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the determining factor was partly Motorola's patent library.
"Despite a failed bid to auction off the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them", the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google, as it alleges that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt 's first freely elected president takes oath
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in, but the day of his inauguration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months earlier.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability", said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence has been a banned organization targeted by the harsh actions of successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived with a small convoy shortly after 11am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's time, the movement was halted only for a short time to pass his motorcade along the normally busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic "Brotherhood spare wheel", his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but for all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", Morsi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden-panelled hall where he took the oath.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given a formal reception with the army orchestra performing the national anthem, during which he stood on the smirno stand.
The military figure field marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan "Army and people, one hand", which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to restore the powers of the president, which his office had been stripped of by a military council that took over from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office in court, not in parliament, as is customary, he is fulfilling the will of the military, and that is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Tyumen region's Association of Machine Builders was held at the Yalutorovsk automobile factory.
The event also saw the presentation of a new line for the production of steel electric welding pipes.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turns out that the region consumes over 50,000 tons of electrical welding pipes a month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production.
This year, more than 7 thousand tons of the products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new plant was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of pipe, which is used for the heating-personal economy, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to produce 50,000 tons of products a year, which will be about 10 percent of the consumption in Tyumen region.
Despite the change to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans when purchasing new equipment - an increase in the staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is re-training personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, a new steel cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimeters is planned to be introduced, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another plant with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes used in housing and communal services.
The company's management has set the goal of covering up to 70 percent of the Tyumen region's needs for this product.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostrumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also the aim of state support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the costs of leasing it.
This year, 150 million rubles are planned for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The last commission to review the subsidy agreements will accept documents from the enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget offsets the costs of local producers' participation in international fairs.
For next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to participating in fairs, 3 million to energy conservation programs.
The funds for the compensation of the equipment ordered and paid for in the south of Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex are reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will be discontinued in the future, as the motive for its introduction was compensation for the tax on the extraction of minerals, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not and subsidies become direct spending obligations of the region.
In view of this, the provincial government considers it a priority to directly support industrial enterprises, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
The budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many enterprise leaders expressed concern over the situation with oil companies.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the industry of the south of the Tyumen region, and with its abolition it will be difficult to compete in price with the middle band of Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company "Rosneft", which does not yet place its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The Uwat project's implementation agreement expires in 2013, and no applications have been received to extend it.
At present, the southern companies of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes on the oil produced in the Uvat region will be paid to the regional budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic will serve 240 hours for extremist video
Tomsk's Leninsky District Court sentenced a city resident to 240 hours of forced labor for posting an extremist video on social media, a spokesperson for the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page in a popular social network that was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as humiliation of human dignity committed publicly".
"The Leninsky District Court considered the case in a special order and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, imposing a sentence of 240 hours of compulsory labor", the agency's interlocutor said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians falling prices after signing association with EU
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will drop significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his Facebook page.
I can say with certainty that prices are determined by a number of factors, including customs fees.
So, once the agreement is signed and the free trade area provisions come into force, the level of customs duties on EU imports will be significantly reduced.
And that means prices will have to come down.
"This is about goods that come from EU countries", Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should be no price increases either.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have appeared in our country quite a lot lately, that association with the EU is a rise in prices, is not quite so, or to be more precise - not at all so", Azarov summed up.
Investigators are checking the information on child abuse in Biesk
On October 29, the media published a report that the teacher of one of the kindergartens in Bijście locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently investigating the circumstances and giving a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of misconduct , Evgenia Vasilieva spoke up .
Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose persona has been the focus of media attention for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press about theft in the Ministry of Defense, or about her personal relationship with former defense minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her fondness for valuables.
However, on November 1, the defendant of the "Oboronservice" case broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva stated: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to get any negative information out of me about the former Minister of Defense".
There was blackmail about me having to testify or I'd be thrown in jail.
These threats have ceased to this day.
Next we're going to court, prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of victory.
From the interview, it can be concluded that perhaps the most hurtful words to Vasilyev were that she was not interested in taste.
Probably, the official representative of the Russian Defense Committee Vladimir Markin's statement that the collection of paintings collected by the defendant of the "Oboronservis" case, was found to be fake.
Among the seized property are a number of paintings, which the owner, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art-science expertise appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings has established that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes", Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from the DOD, saying I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it is just a waste", says Vasilyeva.
At the same time, when asked whether she will admit her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes she is accused of, Vasilyeva said: "Of course not.
There's nothing to confess.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation that is in question.
They're just misleading the public, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasilyev is evading the study of the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the defendant stated that he and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with the materials of the case".
What led to the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and has not yet spoken to the press?
Perhaps as a woman she could not resist an accusation of bad taste?
Or are the "Komsomolki" journalists right, who claimed a few days ago that she "fell into an even bigger trance under house arrest" because of the news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
Victor Baranez, a well-known military commentator for the Communist Party, wrote in his article "Has Serdyukov returned to his wife?" "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogations".
Previously, Vasilyev had been charged with illegal sale of real estate by the Defense Ministry.

In the fall, it is better to choose copper-containing preparations from fungicides, such as 1% Bordeaux mixture or Abiga-Pic, Oxix, Ordan, etc.
You think the Internet has made travel agents go back in time?
Flight Centre seems to be seeing the opposite trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record-breaking holiday revenue in Australia and the UK.
This travel firm now expects its basic full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 and $340 million, compared to a previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If current benchmarks are met, this would be a 1217-percent increase compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had an 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half with good results, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
"We have been operating at a profit since the beginning of the year in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to record record high profits before interest and tax contributions for the full year", he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Its U.S. business has made up for losses during the seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to turn a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre's stock rose 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, Barnaul police identified two gambling halls.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on the runway.
There was a game going on at the time of the check-in.
There were 24 vending machines in the club.
Another game club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov Street.
They used 20 slot machines.
The Russian Interior Ministry in Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been compiled under the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling".
The equipment was confiscated.
In the near future, the materials will be sent to the industrial and Lenin district courts.
In Yekaterinburg , a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, police are looking for a man who brutally assaulted two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to "New Region" in the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after extinguishing the fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on the Ural street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
Soon the identities of the dead were established.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them - a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They took the burned-out apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under personal control by the region's chief police officer, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are working out different versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons inclined to such acts.
It also identifies the purpose for which the women rented the apartment, where they lived before, what they did, with whom they had a relationship.
Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School English literature courses will require students to study at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also include "extra-curricular" texts to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English literature and language course will be canceled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate language exam, with strong recommendations for English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is scheduled to release new curricula in English and math tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
He's gonna make changes to the other majors next year.
The examination regulator OFQUAL will introduce a revised structure for the final examinations of secondary school, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking this summer, Secretary of Education Michael Gove said that there was "a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to regain public trust", insisting that school graduation exams would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while Singaporean students spend about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school math graduation exams combined with higher scores in the ranking table are likely to serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional instruction in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-life tasks", including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow, tourists will be able to take ships from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe on airbags.
For those who want to go to China, it means extra expenses.
A puma ticket is traditionally much more expensive than a boat.
According to the information service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
The trip through the comfort room will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets have not gone up: the same price pumas carried tourists last spring, and a year ago - in the autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth is insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that the growth rate of Russia's GDP is insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions for business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We were planning for GDP growth this year in the region of 3 percent, maybe even a little bit more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
In the context of a recession in a number of European countries, it would not be too bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of other countries, and in general, in order to grow, we need to grow at a higher rate.
It is very important now that Russian companies, Russian business receive normal loans at normal prices - this is the first thing that must be done", the head of government stressed.

Travel through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bvellé provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bevel and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients.
In this West African country there are not so many doctors  only one for every 5,000 people
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bvellé is one of the top 10 CNN characters of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to be CNN's Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his brilliant work.
For 21 years, Georges Bvellé watched his father come back to life and fall unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvellé was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", said Georges Bvellé.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bvellé spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.
"It's not easy", said Bevel.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bevel's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for every 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of health care spending is private.
"Their only problem is poverty", said Bevel.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, Bouillon was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bvellé and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others load up on vans, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and drive through the rough terrain to visit villages in need.
They don't always have good luck.
They had to push their cars through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes: a celebration of song and dance and the finest facilities the locals have to offer.
The free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bevel with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team starts taking hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on each trip", said Bevel.
They're coming from all over the county within a 60-mile radius of the village, and they're coming on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive church bells, donated glasses, or free birth certificates - documents needed for schooling that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgeries are usually performed in a school, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients stand up and walk into the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the surgical and sanitary equipment, Bvellé and his volunteers worked until early Sunday morning.
It's a slow pace, but the band's drive usually helps keep the village musicians going.
"They're beating the drums all night so we can stay awake and keep working", said Bevel.
On Sunday, the crew head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This team of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One man explained that he had received free surgery for his hernia, which would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family", said the man.
In addition to these weekend clinic visits and hospital work, surgeon Bvellé also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second work, he says, that provides 60 percent of the funding for his nonprofit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep", said Kathy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer with the Bewelle group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that they can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley, coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bevel in his mission, it's an opportunity to practice that they would never get at home.
"We had the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bewelle", said O'Malley.
As a sophomore, you would never get this opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their meals, transportation and training are paid for by Bevel.
"He's a hero, without a doubt", said O'Malley.
He has dedicated his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bewelle, the almost constant workload is not a difficult ordeal.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to his father is what brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", said Bevel.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh, to ease their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can do to help.
Snowden has agreed to testify about the Merkel wiretap .
The Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Schrebel met in Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Federal Prosecutor's Office in the case of possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor's phone by the US intelligence services.
Snowden has expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, Hans-Christian Strabel said, that he knew a lot.
And even though the NSA, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But first, we must define the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, American lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding the US spyware.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill that would impose additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated by the Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei at a press conference after meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, the correspondent of BELTA reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the state authorities of the two countries will provide all-round assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between them", Vladimir Makei noted.
He stressed that the Belarusian government would create all the necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also informed that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, and a protocol was signed.
The parties developed a roadmap for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and economic and investment areas, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as on the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting was fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners", he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said that the heads of the two countries' foreign ministries decided to continue developing mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, needs to be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
Our relations have always been very warm and we hope that they will continue to grow and strengthen.
All necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey", - said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama backs out on his health care talk
Amidst a storm of criticism, President Obama backtracked yesterday on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise that if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.
With hundreds of thousands of people receiving shutdown notices from their providers, Republicans have been criticizing the president for misleading American society in recent days.
Obama slightly tweaked his initial public promise yesterday.
"Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called the "news revival" of the shutdown, Obama urged those Americans who received the notices to look for alternatives in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than they anticipated.
"You'll get better terms", he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who buy insurance themselves may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say this directly to these Americans: you deserve better", Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sybelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been "terribly bad" since October.
"I'm upset and angry like everyone else", she said.
I really want to earn your trust back.
An angry Sybelius dropped this phrase, picked up by the on-air microphone, to the aide sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing after a heated debate with House Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she should join Obama's health care program herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily forego government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov that she now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt Agency stripped of media status for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license of the Rosbalt Agency, writes "Lenta".
The ROSKOMNADZOR insisted on depriving the agency of its media status for systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
An unpleasant precedent was created during the trial: the court found it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to raise counterarguments.
What is Rosebalt?
Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has been developing and functioning as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was among the most recognizable private Internet-media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement.
Talks about the publication's proximity to the power structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
Besides the fact that Rosbalt had a vast database of sources in various departments, the fact that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was in charge of the project also suggested such assumptions.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the management of "Rosbalt" is not completely clear: most often she is called "the head of the project".
The agency's general director is Larisa Afonina, and its editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Rosbalt has not been ranked by the federal media - not by citation or audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the ranking of visitor numbers of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the rosbalt.ru website is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes about the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Joke", the pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
The conflict between Roskomnadzor and Rosbalt began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media came into force, prohibiting journalists from using uncensored language.
The agency found prohibited vocabulary in two videos posted on the agency's website ("Djigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled oil towers").
The next part is described differently.
Roskomnadzor, based on the discovered video materials, accused "Rosbalt" of gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court to withdraw the agency's license.
In Rosbalt, they stated that the claims of the department were unlawful: first, the videos were not editorial materials, second, the mother's words were masked in them, and third, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The agency's representatives appealed Roskomnadzor's claims in the international court - and when the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor's claim on October 22, 2013, the appeals were still pending.
However, on the 25th the judge has made a decision against "Rosbalt": the chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, that's what decided the outcome of the Moscow City Court hearing - if you dismiss the idea that the outcome could have been decided earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the registration certificate of "Rosbalta", effectively depriving the agency of the status of a media outlet.
It cannot be said that Rosebalt was alone in this confrontation.
The agency was supported by the State Duma deputies (the application to the name of Roskomnadzor head Alexander Jarov was signed by 26 deputies on October 10; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CPFR).
The head of the Russian Union of Journalists, Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, stated that the publication was illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskomnadzor management even gave him some guarantees that the license would not be revoked.
The Rosbalt trial has shown that the question of who is the safest media outlet in Russia today is a big one.
Syria has destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all of its declared chemical weapons production facilities, as recognized by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first stage of disarmament, Damascus completed a day before the deadline.
Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare the use of military poisons by November 1, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the poisoning substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors have been deployed to Syria after a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 killed more than 1,400 people, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was to stop the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent any repairs.
The next milestone is mid-November, when the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy the poisoning stockpile.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully vetted by Western intelligence.
They're willing to recommend new sites to inspectors if there's any reason to suspect that Damascus isn't fully open.
The U.S. believes that this bombing was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that it was the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement reached with the mediation of Russia, destroy or disable all facilities for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids, and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that that stage is over, the next step should be to destroy the chemical weapons already in the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal may contain over 1,000 tons of nerve-paralyzing poisons, skin-narrowing mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals, stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, the OPCW and the Syrian authorities must first agree on a timetable of action, which is two weeks away.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally oversaw the destruction of the equipment".
"They no longer have the ability to produce or mix chemical weapons", he said.
The OPCW statement said inspectors had visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and found that the factories producing the shells and poisonous substances were either destroyed or rendered inoperable.
The other two sites are too dangerous to inspect, the document says, but the equipment was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons production infrastructure was "particularly difficult" because it had to work in the context of an ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said the inspectors had no time to celebrate - they were too busy with their work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage has gone too far.
John Kerry demonstrated a softening of the defense tactics of US surveillance programs by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases US spying "has gone too far".
The Secretary also admitted that he was on autopilot with Barack Obama during the heated revelations by Edward Snowden about NSA spying.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking by video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There's no doubt that the president and I and other members of the government have actually been able to see some of the things that are happening on autopilot, because that was already possible during World War II, and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, September 11th".
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far.
And the president is determined to shine a light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and he's now conducting a thorough analysis to make sure no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good intentions and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is a radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, to blow up people and to attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happened?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and people getting killed because we could know about these plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations because of frustration with the surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the national security of the United States that the Europeans remain our supporters in our joint counterterrorism efforts", said Democrat Murphy, a first-term senator and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.
News that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, though the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the US.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on the Allies as necessary and said it was a common practice on both sides.
Amid the buzz, Murphy said his office is organizing a congressional trip expected this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other lawmakers involved should be announced in the coming days.
He said the trip's still in the works.
While Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip is to promote better relations, he said that some degree of "rigidity from the best of intentions" would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves have used for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to accept the fact that we are not the only ones doing intelligence", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
The prisoners ' influence will grow in the new compositions of the public observation commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (PO) can approve the new compositions of the Public Observation Commissions (PECs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the proposed amendment is approved, the force's lobbyists will increase their influence.
The OJCs are the public bodies that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvzhayev, the unrest in the Kopean colony - it is through the ONK that most of the resonant incidents behind bars are publicized.
There is a struggle between human rights activists and law enforcement lobbyists to control the NCO.
At the meeting of the working group of the OP on the formation of NCOs, I proposed to make the experience of human rights activities a selection criterion.
"He was not accepted, and the lists were formed without developing criteria", - says Valery Borchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Observation Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - a Russian-wide structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
As a state Duma deputy from "Yablok" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council has to vote on the composition of the NCOs in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand people are applying for 1800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria the competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The O.P. promises to fill the vacancies.
The Moscow National Committee is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, the current composition of the capital commission is 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes to 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the capital commission.
But the new team may be re-entered by the representative of the "Fighting Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the O.N.C. for three years, but he never visited prisoners.
Borchev believes that the security forces, having appointed their chairman of the NCO, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
They believe that the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by the member of the ONK Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast", Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights activists from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he wasn't even interested in what list the OP is voting for.
He considers Borchchev's disclosure of information a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk NCO.
Its former leaders were suspended because of last year's Copper riots.
The Public Chamber concluded that the local commission had ignored the prisoners' problems.
But the Rostov-on-Don NGO could go from human rights activists to law enforcement.
The new lists "disappeared" the local commission chairman, but one of his opponents was found, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
Borshchev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions "revenge for Kopeisk".
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the Mordovia NSC, which is considered "powerful": only one human rights defender wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
OP council member Nikolai Svaniidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted for it because he likes the Moscow list.
The lists were compiled by Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the Scientific Research Institute of the Federal Statistical Institute.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not think it is right to divide the candidates into human rights defenders and law enforcement officers and disagrees with the fact that the commission chairmen have enough power to impede the work of its members.
Gryb doesn't predict the outcome of the OP council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against jail time in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver appealed her sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rothschild Bamford was initially found guilty of filing a false lawsuit on June 15 by Phuket Provincial Court after a report by Thai police that a local taxi driver had carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after breaking off her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
She was held in local police cells before her trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a general-regime detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tank, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's welfare and was waiting for her return to Australia.
"Obviously, it's been a troubled time, but we hope she gets home safely as soon as possible", Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in the court extending her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be seeking to rebuild its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is currently in Paris for the presentation of his novel "Yeltishevs", translated into French.
It is his novel that has been a finalist for four prizes: "Jasnaya Polaina", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer was awarded the Russian Federation Government Prize in the field of culture for this book.
Roman Senchin is the undisputed leader in the generation of thirty- and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his hard, contemporary-based stories and novels has sparked heated debates among critics of various stripes.
It can be argued that the articles on Senchin's prose and publicism, reviews of his books and journal publications, collected together, create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers", according to critic Sergey Chuprinin, the talk is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature", how they see the present and the future not only of our wording, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviated form in the sections "Abzats...
