Shouted to the World
The marketing campaign for Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well, and the outdoor shouts and calls are attracting people around the world.
"You own the alley, I need Iceland", says a woman out in the big world, commenting on an ad from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on the YouTube content channel.
Another viewer says goodbye, and Iceland will be in his heart forever. And a young woman says straight up, whoever gets to the end of Iceland first is her fiancé.
Unfortunately, however, she is in the United States, and she assumes that she will have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the route to Iceland is complete, since there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story if he's from another time zone.
Egill Thórðarson of the Peel advertising agency, which produced the ads with international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says interviews have been more than expected.
I found many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already setting records.
Basically, it's about creating PR value, it's about getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in some seven hundred media outlets worldwide, reaching a total of two billion people.
The value of that envelope is estimated at $1.8 billion.
It's not adorable.
The main market for all is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although the Americans are not on their way to the country any time soon.
According to Egils, well-known markets such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also been welcoming, as has Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there was the reaction from outlying regions, such as India, which was not specifically mentioned.
"These ads have gone farther than we expected", Egill says, adding that over four million people have watched the ad on YouTube.
We couldn't have asked for a better start.
The opening photographs were taken by Arne Sæberg, a photographer for Morgunjornalen, in mid-March, when he was photographing a commercial with the headline "Let It Out".
The works were carried out in a wide range of places, such as at the School Guard in Reykjavik, at Reynisfjöru, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökli and at Hjörleifshöfða.
The film was directed by Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions and scored by Óttar Guðnason.
Roles in the series included Anna Jia from Iceland and Murphy Cardenas from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as recordings were taking place in the South, another group was in the West and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, Let It Out is only the first installment of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is intended to be a winter campaign in partnership with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office", Egill says, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been a tremendous success.
It's great to work with them.
In projects like this, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.
Explosive: The state of the job market, the pension fund, and more
Minister for Social Affairs and Children Einar Daddason will attend the Explosion which starts at 10am today at the Bylgjunn.
He is also Minister for Labour and deals with the labour market situation as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
It also deals with rural affairs and the transfer of activities to land that has been badly run and disputed over the past years and decades.
The programme will also feature Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will discuss his criticism of pension fund investments and propose ideas for the trade union movement and trade unionists to pull themselves out of the board of directors of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then they will be interviewed by Ívar Ingimarsson, a tourist agent in the East, and by Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttur, the director of the Marketing Office of the North, about the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the summer's success is a misleading portent of what is to come.
You can listen to the program below, but it starts at 10:00.
This is what it looks like today, 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of teen shows.
She became world famous for her role as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch alongside Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
She has been a little bit carried away lately, but she did manage to look across the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television these days.
She speaks very highly of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and says she was a wonderful person.
I have to admit, I built my character mostly on girls I met at school who weren't nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was, "Donovan said about his role in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after a night out
About 50 cases were reported to the Metropolitan Police today, and the police diary says the cases were diverse.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to take the place of a man who had recently been released from prison after being held there for a long time because of a car accident.
The man refused to leave after his release and disobeyed police orders to leave.
The man was admitted to the police station for his progress.
Then a man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in Copenhagen.
Police also had to have two men replaced in Breiðholt because of reports of physical assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting in a corner of a shopping mall in Copenhagen was unable to pay the bill at the end of the meal, and the police were called.
There was also a report of a vehicle being stolen in the city center this morning.
A white Renault van driver searched for her for temporary reasons and was then taken into custody.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Glebe - The Horrible Fate of the Glebe
The theory has made its way onto the Internet that the curse rests on the series about the Merry Wives, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the early days, becoming the third main character of the series to live long before her time.
The Glee series is a popular series of songs, dances, and cheer.
The series featured a high school youth's so-called party, their love affair, and their destiny.
While being in the party was not always a rare thing, singing and dancing seemed to help the characters overcome whatever situation they encountered.
But outside the studio, the cast and crew have been devastated, so much so that theories have been raised that the show is cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a clapping actress who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the series ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey, with whom she had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to press charges, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, Riviera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piro, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and could tell police that he and his mother had stumbled into the water and that Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned.
Started an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the local police chief reported that the search had been based on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is said that she was caught in a heavy current in the water and used her last breath to save her son.
The cause of death was listed as accidental drunkenness.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson on the show, the American football player with the voice of an angel who played a key role in moving the Joy Division to fame and recognition.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith faced a personal devil.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to break free.
In 2013, his co-workers on the show got tired, stepped in and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to therapy and everything seemed to be looking in the right direction.
Just two months after his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after a night out with friends.
Banamein turned out to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a will.
Moneith had been treated, and his tolerance for drugs had decreased so much that doses he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his colleagues, but under the guidance of his rival Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the series and dedicate the entire series to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took on the role of Noah Puck Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow Cheerleaders, or at least until he had the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of defending child pornography.
We searched his home and found a huge amount of child pornography, and the matter was soon brought to the attention of the public.
Clearly, Salling was gone.
He was subsequently charged and acquitted of his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison, plus a list of sex offenders and treatment for child abuse.
Before a judge could sentence Salling, who was then free on bail, he was found dead near his home.
Dan's cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors on the show who fell from ages ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He was abruptly crushed to death in his sleep in 2013, at the age of just 41.
Another woman, Nancy Motes, worked on the series.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts, and her sister did not share the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of excessive dominance and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 while battling severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her fiancé, claiming that her mother and sister were responsible for her fate.
"My mother and my so-called siblings leave me nothing but the memory of the people who caused my worst depression".
Michel Lea was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her cast members' focus and exit on the set and of having a pervasive celebrity image.
Jesse Luken guest starred on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with a 2019 rape, which was highly obscene.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, her nude photos were leaked onto the Internet by unprotected computer viruses.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the series and had an off-show romance.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
Playing in the garden with parents, growing flowers, and watching them grow and blossom helps children to grow.
There is also an endless supply of flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the garden is something you never forget.
They will remember the flowers, the smell, and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Bought a boat after 10th grade
'I don't think we have many sailors working in the country's game schools,' says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who takes up beach fishing in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland in the winter.
Fishing on the beach is a very convenient summer job when you are in school.
If you fish well, you can make a good living, and I'm thrilled to be able to get out of taking student loans.
The income also helps me well into the winter", says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who is fishing on the beach this summer, as he did last summer.
Axel was newly anchored at the Tálknafirði pier when a reporter got a call from him late in the evening earlier this week.
As a 10th-grader, I took a pilot's license for boats under 40 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I graduated from elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jonesson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped sailing, and he was very pleased to see that the boat bore his name.
"A few years after I took over the boat, Hartmann died", says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million dollars.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished hunting.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it.
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
I had saved up money, I had worked with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I spent all my summers fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my pension money in my boat safe.
Axel was born in Issafirt, where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kopavog since he was a boy.
I'm allowed to fish here in the West Country because I'm licensed by my grandmother in the Isle of Man.
I studied in this area west of Rhodes with my father.
I'll go as far as I like, because this hunting ground covers the whole of the West Coast.
While I prefer to be out west, I've also been around the Snake River and beyond.
I've also given to the sun, but I prefer grass, says Axel, who always puts a fire in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the maggots and sings to the sky, in the solitude of our time together on the ballarat.
The internet is good on the beach, so I can make phone calls, listen to radio shows and music.
I don't mind being on a boat by myself.
"I try to avoid getting into trouble, but there have certainly been occasions when there was something wrong, but never a big risk", says Axel, who is fortunate that he never has seasickness.
He says the length of the workday will depend on how the fishing is done at any given time.
 In coastal fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the quota system, but then I have been continuously one and a half hours at sea fishing.
The shore-fishing regulations allow him to catch up to 1,300 pounds [777 kg] a day, which he finds discouraging.
Other obstacles are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish 12 days a month, during the four months when beach fishing is prohibited, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary press is to be repressed instead of having 48 days all summer and choosing as you please.
"I think that the regionalisation could also be a problem for me and that marine habitats that are well placed for fishing should be able to enjoy it", says Axel, who draws most of the saltwater cod from his beach fishing, but also brings along some reindeer and other unique species.
Axel is working over the winter with his university degree at the Nupi kindergarten in Kopavog.
"I don't think we have many sailors working at the country's play schools", says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the school.
I'm stuck because I love this job.
I hope that psychology will be useful to me at the kindergarten level in the future", says Axel, who also has a degree in business.
Villa in registration prevented home contamination
The fact that a person living in the country was not called back for the sample was a result of the fact that the people fill in the registration form when they come to the country.
The registration of a degree is not required if the applicant completes the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"We'll see about that this week", says a specialist in the field of homeland security.
Three domestic infections were reported in the Department of Virology at the Regional Hospital yesterday.
One of those who tested positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the so-called home quarantine rules took effect.
Those who were living in Iceland are then screened upon arrival and re-examined four or five days later.
However, the afternoon news report of RÚV reported that the applicant had adopted the old system.
His test at the border was negative, and he wasn't called back for a virus check.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of land defense, says in an interview with a news agency that this can be attributed to a mistake in the electronic registration journal.
People filling out the English form are not required to enter a reference number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
However, it was primarily for foreign tourists.
The person concerned has not been automatically invited to come for sampling.
However, Kamilla says many have followed the rules of home inspection even though they filled out the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been wary of sending people back for a sample after it arrived in the country.
This week will look at how to make it easier for people to access this process.
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in solitary confinement.
They're all going to the lab, but two of them were starting to show symptoms.
The three cases detected yesterday are currently under control, but the two cases detected on Friday have largely been completed.
In both cases, sequencing by the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the link was directed to Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be clear by tomorrow where the virus came from.
A total of 15 are currently in quarantine, according to the COVID website.
135 is in the line of fire.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five cases of domestic infection have been reported in the country in the past few days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup athletics event yesterday has not been determined.
The infection is still present.
Originally, the third dozen were exclusively sent in a single batch, but this was reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are in distress because of the new infections that were reported yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event, and it has raised questions about whether such an event should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications director for the Public Security Department of the State Police, says it well, as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
We are continually urging all residents to maintain their personal immunity.
We also need to warn people who are hosting events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then you can have an event, says John.
He says that keeping an individual's personal anti-infective medication in the air can prevent infection.
Rules and guidelines are also under constant review.
What needs to be done, and what the Public Health Service and the Regional Medical Office are constantly urging people to do, is to take care of this individual infectious agent.
Both home and service companies.
People washing their hands and drinking.
It prevents the spread of infection, says John.
Let us encourage others to continue in the same way in which we have already progressed.
40% of COVID-19 victims were with type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard the phone ringing, how her father was struggling to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The respiratory system was affected by a sudden respiratory distress caused by a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as the underlying condition, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified of the same fate.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not without reason.
A recent study commissioned by the U.S. government shows that nearly 40 percent of those who die have type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the proportion of those under 65 is taken into account, the figure rises to half.
The CDC surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the results are shocking, not least for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
The fall in slow growth was a Reuters survey, pointing to the responses from the 12 countries that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, have yet to detect the underlying disease.
The diabetes epidemic was already slow-growing.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful plague, according to Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of Latin American descent, who have also been hit hard by the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses against type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control by exercising, eating a balanced diet, and receiving the help of health professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to keep up with their routine for weeks at a time.
The high cost of insulin has, in turn, forced some to keep coming to work and thus to avoid exposure to the virus.
Reuters reports that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with type 2 diabetes might be exposed to the virus.
At the onset of the SARS coronavirus in 2003, roughly 20% of those infected were infected, and during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS was first detected in 2012, one study found that 60 percent of those who died or were admitted to intensive care were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could be prolonged, the pandemic has swept away a number of previously unknown complications.
"I'm afraid we're going to see a flurry of problems once this is over", says Andrew Bolton, president of the World Association of Diabetes.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to an unintended increase in complications of diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
As recent studies have shown, the coronavirus could be leading to a rise in diabetes.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus infects the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already diseased in many people with diabetes.
Such high glucose and lipid levels in diabetics can trigger what is called a "cell messenger storm", as the immune system reacts too strongly and attacks the body.
Damage to the cells of the lining can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood loss.
"It's all one big puzzle", says Dela Cruz.
It's all connected.
The story has been corrected.
We were offered champagne, and they left the room.
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were forced to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was putting up in Paris at the unusual invitation from the artist Ragnari Kjartanssyni.
We loved each other, so it wasn't complicated.
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Asruña Magnús daughter, for the first time.
I was very impressed with her.
It was just the editing, of course, but then I also found it incredibly cute.
And still, he says.
The husband also remembers the first meeting regularly.
I hear that story all the time.
Last time, just over the weekend, she says, who also attracted her husband on the first date.
I felt and still feel such a great excitement around Atlas that I like it.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I'm really excited about it.
Atli says that the couple has focused their relationship on going their own ways.
We don't tie our bags with the same knots as the travellers.
We avoid the strains we detect around us.
That may be why they took the message from Ragnari Kjartansson, the artist, merely as a celebration, though it was unusual.
"Our mutual friend Christine Anna has contacted us and asked if we could come for dessert with her, Ragg and Ginger's wife Ragnar, at Snaps".
They took the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and each other's dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
He had a series of videos called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in a simple way.
Asrún says he described the work as banal and decadent, a departure from the everyday life of Westerners.
He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and the last thing he told us was what he wanted to know if we would be interested in doing.
The scene Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show young millipedes making love in a minimalist room.
"These are coincidences with a beginning and an end", says Atli.
The couple didn't know much about Ragnar, although they knew about him and he about them. But they knew about us and thought we fit in.
They had a reputation for not wanting to advertise to people.
Perhaps they thought they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual advantages from performing for others.
They fed Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
When we left Snaps, we said, "Isn't this all we're about?"
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as the artist and his entire team", says Asrún and Atli takes over.
It's about love and closeness
Senna was taken to a nice apartment on Myrrha Street.
There was a very short film crew; the cinematographer, Ragnar and the sound engineer and the pair.
After the recording was started, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Asrun.
We hadn't decided what we were going to be.
We got some little instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be uncertain about what we were doing and for whom.
It was nothing to play with, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated", says Asrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic", says Atli, and Asrún agrees.
We were offered a glass of champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like vacationing in a fancy hotel in Paris.
The team was delighted with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi the photographer saw this, he cried, he liked it so much", says Atli.
"It's about love and closeness and the interactions themselves", says Asrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in his son at the Reykjavik Art Gallery and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to peck at this", says Atli.
Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this before, but then Dad just texted me and said, "It's nice to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo", recalls Asrún.
And would the work have deepened the relationship between Asr and Atla?
At least we're still together, so maybe this got us somewhere.
"It really deepened my relationship with my in-laws", says Ásrún, laughing.
Asrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else", she says, turning to her husband.
But it was fun to see it because it's just one scene in a much bigger work, and when you see it with the other pieces, it's really great.
I kind of got away from it and was just proud.
And there was a little bump in my belly", says Asrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the stinger was removed.
It was just beautiful.
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them in the first episode of Love Stories.
Swansea win their first ever play-off
Swansea beat Brentford 1-0 in a dramatic game.
It was the first game of the teams' qualifying campaign for the Premier League.
The match was played at Swansea Stadium in Wales.
The score in the half was 0-0.
Swansea City won the match in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the bow from the penalty spot and missed the defence.
Just two minutes later, Brentford's Rico Henry got the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game one less man and in the 82nd minute, Swansea's players used the difference.
Andre Ayew then added to the whitewash by scoring a brilliant goal and ensuring Swansea a 1-0 victory.
Swansea lead 1-0 in the first leg, but the second leg will be played next Wednesday at Brentford.
Minister without portfolio for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, has been in the spotlight since CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed life sentence because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as Ambassador to the United States in April 2009, there has been a total of 62 months without an ambassador in the country, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under extraordinary circumstances, but Kastljós announced in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a call from the office of the president of that country that she would not be allowed to speak.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor took over in September 2010.
This is partly because Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador but had resigned.
The job was eventually taken by Loius Ariega, who had been in the foreign service for decades.
He resigned in the fall of 2013 to take up the post of Ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we went on another missionary tour.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and sworn in shortly thereafter, but by then no ambassador had been on the ground for 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee, not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's campaign.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office, on January 20, 2017, as is the custom with politically appointed ambassadors.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington administration.
So it took two years before the U.S. Senate summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to its meeting to question him on the spears and confirm that he was done as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony before parliament he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is deceased, had been of Dutch descent.
Gunter is a political appointee, a former California dermatologist, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The organization was founded by casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest such period in Iceland's history.
This is due to both the length of time the Trump administration has been nominating people for the presidency and the fact that in recent years the work of the US Congress has been greatly stretched, including the confirmation of ambassadors.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of five years.
However, this has not prevented the Embassy from opening a new headquarters in Engjateig.
The cost of the project is estimated at $6.5 billion, but the building is surrounded by thick security walls and bulletproof glass in all the windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security, as he is said to be in fear for his life and has requested an armed life guard.
Former IBV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - It was a mistake to come to Iceland
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says he was subjected to racism while in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is according to an interview with Tonny that appeared in the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, a team that plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country, where he played with ÍBV, Val and Þrótti in Iceland.
When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I used to.
"The team captain was in that position but he also had the number of the shirt I wanted so I didn't get either of the things I wanted", says Tonny, who played on the right wing during the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
This happened to me once, but since I did not understand the language, I simply ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case, and I asked my friend what it was about.
He told me that my opponent had made a racial comment about me after I had knocked him out.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
It says he's made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny had not managed to make his way into the first team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway I would have had the opportunity I wanted to have", says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway he would probably come back longer.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has ruined his dreams of making it to the big leagues in Europe.
Found a snake in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm-long black worm in the throat of a woman who searched for it.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with a splint.
Investigation revealed that the animals were parasites.
CNN is reporting this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is a thin cut of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites on board are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi has made its way to Western countries, cases of parasites infecting humans have increased, reports CNN.
Fears of a second wave in Europe
Spain is currently in a state of emergency due to concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, but governments have taken steps to restart the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been frozen for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are on the rise.
Other European countries have also taken action against the spread of the virus in Spain, but in the United Kingdom, like in Norway, everyone must go home from Spain in quarantine, and the French have been warned against travel to Spain.
Infections are also on the rise in France and Germany, where governments are trying to balance the spread of the virus and the economic recovery.
Europe is in a good position compared with the rest of the world, but the global rate of new infections is approaching 300,000 a day, with the Americas and South Asia having the highest numbers.
The number of confirmed infections worldwide has reached 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the number of confirmed deaths related to the virus has reached 644,000.
Mosaic Work Finally Fully Enjoys Its Fullness
In front of the Reykjavik Customs House is a large and deep hole.
Upstairs, there are men with orange helmets.
There's a big tomb there too.
And more small machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the aisle is paved, and many now stand there, admiring the millions of mosaic panels they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not as expected.
The work has been somewhat hidden, right in front of it there were parking lots that were always occupied.
People lay there, quickly locked their cars, and then jumped out to their business in the city center.
"Living and diverse public spaces" and "attractive city streets" are the guiding light for the reconstruction of the Security Street, which is currently underway.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic of the Holy Mother of God at the Tollhouse to enjoy a better view.
A square will be built in front of the work, and the area is considered suitable as a place for road users to stay because of its sunny location.
The artwork will be illuminated, allowing the audience to enjoy the work better than ever on this 142-square-meter screen.
The site also features small "tokudars", a type of water sculpture, which offers play and gives the area a certain concealment.
This is how the reforms are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is working with Veitum.
Water, heat and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them are outdated, but the school bill and the Water and Sanitation Act date back to 1925 and have served the residents and businesses of the downtown area for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will be a single-step carriageway, with more quiet and accessible spaces for pedestrians soon to be created.
A news article on the customs office's website says that the building was commissioned in 1971, and was designed by Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the sea breeze that penetrated the house, a wall of 250 square feet (250 sq m) of windowless walls led out onto the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a fence would have a negative effect on the overall design of the street if special arrangements were not made to decorate the building.
The nobles agreed to a settlement for the installation of a permanent work of art.
At this time, much was said about Gerdi Helgadotttur, an artist, says the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic art projects in Germany and abroad.
The solution was to contact her first before deciding whether material would be competitive for the job.
It had often been argued that the work should reflect the life of the port, as the port had been a vibrant part of Reykjavik since its construction.
When the artist was interviewed, she was struck by the idea of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from the country of origin, where she would work on the projects abroad.
Karen was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
She was promptly asked to do the work.
In addition, a full contract was sought with the famous German art company, the Oidtmann Brothers, with whom Gerður had long worked on exhibitions of famous artworks throughout Europe.
The contract was successful, and Gerhard worked on the artwork under the supervision of the brothers, who then oversaw the installation at the Customs House.
The work was done with exceptional skill, both by Gerðar Helgadottor and the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
Since then, the island has endured unprecedented weather.
It took about two years to complete the work, which was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tower was completed, at the age of only 47.
Under-prepared transport of more bodies to shore
Minister for Social Affairs Einar Daddason suggests that more public institutions be relocated in the near future.
That's what the minister said on the "Bombing the Wave" program this afternoon.
It was recently announced that the Housing and Human Resources Department's well-planned area will be moved north to Sauðárkrók in the fall.
Six experts in the field of wells work for the organization, but none of them are willing to follow the organization north and the National Association of Fire and Ambulance Carriers has criticized the well operations.
I think we should take a step further into this world.
I'm preparing another step into this world.
"Fresh transport", said Mr. Amundsen.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more public institutions spread across the country.
'I think there needs to be more political decisions on the transfer of public services to the land, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Department,' said Ásmundur, but he also took the example of other agencies that have been transferred to the land and have been of great importance to communities abroad, such as the transfer of the Food Authority to Selfoss, the Land Survey of Iceland to Akraness and the Jobless Assurance Agency in Skaggs.
Highlights from the second day of the World Championships
The 94th Icelandic Freestyle Championship ended at the Thor's Field in Akureyri today.
Several sets of goals were set on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition was expected in the women's sleaziest on the ice, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in the sleaziest in 2014, which lasted until Elisbet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the score in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic team back earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form up to recently, but she has tripled the Icelandic team since the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with an injury and has not been able to get out of bed today.
She had only one gallant throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís set the fastest throw of the day, or 60.08 meters, on her final attempt, setting a meet record.
Her national record, set earlier in July, is 62.69 meters, and she was somewhat off.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, the FH-Englishman Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder, won in a slam-dunk, safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last throw and set a counter-metric.
His national record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympic champion and Iceland's record holder in the shot put, won a competition in the shot put at Thornsveld yesterday, but today he competed in the shot put, which is his main discipline.
Iceland's record holder, Guðna Vals, is 65.53 meters, but he threw a longest throw of 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second-longest throw today, but he had one gold throw that landed in second place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdis Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic long jumper, won the long jump competition with a jump of 6.25 meters today, which is about 40 cm from her Icelandic long jumper.
In the women's 200 metres, the Irish sprinter Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir was the fastest, finishing in 24.04 seconds, while her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
The winner was Gudbjörg Jonah at Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meters and the 4 x 100 meters relay, and then also in the 4 x 400 meters relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to finish in the 200 meters in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelsson from Ármán.
Like Jonah, the Swallowhead won gold in the 100-meter dash yesterday as well as in the 400-meter dash.
Not getting fined for 27 million crowns of Bitcoin fraud
The IRS has rejected a request from a tax inspector who demanded a fine on a man for misrepresenting his financial assets generated by the sale of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.
The Committee concludes that the Director of Public Instruction did not provide clear reasons why the fine was necessary.
The Commission's decision states that the tax inspector considered that the person had made substantially incorrect tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.
He would have neglected his financial losses resulting from the sale of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency of 27 million, either intentionally or through extreme recklessness.
A man's punishment for his pride.
The man refused in a letter to the committee.
He did, however, admit to having sold 27 million pieces of electrical coins in 2016.
She would have acquired it by grafting it between 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coin, the tax revenue from such sales would have been highly vague and unpredictable.
It would have been reasonable to expect that ordinary citizens would have taken note of such tax relief measures.
He would not have intended to avoid paying the tax on the increase and would have reported his assets on the income as a deposit in the foreign exchange accounts.
He had consulted both the tax authorities and the public prosecutor on the matter, but to no avail.
He then felt it necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would thus be worse off than others for introducing complex rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion about.
The man therefore felt justified in having his taxes for those two years of income reassessed and stressed, but otherwise not punished.
He then insisted that he was in Iceland and had paid taxes on the land since 2012.
He would never have intended to evade his responsibilities by casual means.
The demand for a fine would be outrageous and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur is a big deal: This guy understands what football is
Andersen Willumsson's brunette has been a fixture amongst the crowd, but also a sensation for his performances in what is now a season with Breadable in the Pepsi Max division.
The Blades will be in the spotlight tonight when they receive a live broadcast from IA on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes the ball out due to four reminders in the season and does not come to play with a new cut as in the summer games so far.
He had written bla, bla, bla on his collar for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 10.
I don't know who he was answering the payment to, but speaking of character, this one was more of a try-on in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every single time and if there was someone going to level this game then I thought he would do it or make it up", said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max costume, when the talk was about fighting Brynjólfi.
I'm supposed to be here for the people.
It's hard to see where he's at sometimes.
He's looking a little bit out of the left side when it comes to feeling the game, but he's got a very free roll in the team", said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
The director Máni Pétursson tells Brynjólf that he is a real entertainer and celebrates the fact that he has such a colorful man in the league: No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a funny guy and I love it with his hair, and being always ready to show up and answer interviews.
There's an incredible amount of people fascinated by him, which tells me that this guy understands what football is.
I'm a fun guy.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.
People are reading the interview with Brynjólf, people are getting in and watching what's next on his hair.
"This man is just a genius", said Man.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club -  I have been in contact with several teams in the B-League
Tobias Thomsen, the KR player in the Pepsi Max League, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish news outlet Bold, Tobias is ready to go back home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but for that he must first cancel his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic league.
The club knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding", Tobias told Bold.
I've been in contact with a few teams in the B-League and will probably switch before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR.
He then says that he will likely have to accept a salary increase in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have probably found more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.
Bjartmar has renamed a bike for millions - now answers after a DV interview
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has pursued a hobby unlike most others.
He locates and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, e-bikes, and handbags.
Bjartmar has been nicknamed the "Bicycle Swinger" for the week.
Yesterday, there was a lot of fuss when a man published an account of his interaction with Bjartmar.
DV then referred them to a discussion on a Facebook group of Westborgs where it was revealed that Bjartmar had interviewed the man on the East Side and said the vest might have been stolen.
The only thing that could be read from the original writings of the electrician was that Bjartmar had stolen it.
The lyrics have now been changed on Facebook and the preview of the original newscast has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar's initial reports of the case are not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday in Ostorvel.
Bjartmar said he got information from the victim of an electrical accident that these were indeed his electrical accidents.
The information was given to the alleged owner by someone else, but Bjartmar says the information turned out to be wrong.
I looked for the boy and I searched the boat, ending up with information that there was an electrical switch that had been missing for a very long time and was being searched for.
I was hesitant at first, but when I saw him getting ready to take off on the boat, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was convinced of his guilt, so I decided to talk to the man.
I usually do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the floor.
Bjartmar says that the man at the electricity booth signed an invitation to show him the bike receipt and called the police himself.
"Well, great", said Beard, "let's just get this straight".
Then the owner of the utility went to verify the ownership of his utility and set off.
Later, the real owner of the utility shared his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
In the year that Bjartmar has been doing this, he says he can count the changes he made to people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík", said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are the most corrupt of the community's younger brothers and sisters, drug addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the streets for some reason.
"The drug is a hard master and somehow you have to finance the next batch, because unfortunately, stealing from such loose funds is an easy way to that goal", says Bjartmar.
My interactions with these people are actually so good that I've brought a lot of these good people into my team.
"I've had people come to me for treatment and to take care of me and to help me with what I'm doing", he says.
In general, Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are on a polite note.
Some know about him and his activities and offer to show him receipts, bicycle numbers, and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has received little attention.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to point people to him for stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is displeased with the earlier news coverage of DV and claims not to be some kind of self-appointed police officer in a personal quest for justice.
Asked whether he is still on the ice with his activities, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
Of course the police are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is, the police are not doing this.
I have to photograph watching the officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles.
It is quite uncritical in these matters.
"When the police are not involved, and this is just in front of your face, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this case, why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has been so successful in riding stolen bicycles that he sometimes drives his schoolmates down the street that they just get the Bjartmar bike they had previously ridden.
The times Bjartmar has called for police assistance have been when she has simply not come.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the bike owners", said Bjartmar, and he regrets that victims of bike theft have to suffer from police inaction in this case.
Bjartmar's success is not disputed.
Many people have told stories of thanking Bjartmar for having their property back.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost track of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts are certainly in the millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric scooters, e-bikes, and electric scooters are heavy, but an e-bike can cost less than half a million dollars.
Bjartmar works at a kindergarten every day and every other weekend he works in a dormitory.
His hobby is therefore an unpaid job that he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a big anniversary year for the pension fund in Iceland.
Officials had been receiving pensions from the Danish king since the 19th century, but in 1919 a civil servants' pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation for the current pension funds for general employees was then laid by the general labour market agreements of 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with a defined contribution and a full fundraising from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974 these agreements were made law, and the pension system continued to evolve.
The workers' pension system was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century pushed through with its electoral campaign.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained by similar means in the historic strike of 1955, and the organizations also gradually advanced their demands for sickness and sickness insurance, substantial leave entitlements, shorter working hours, housing reforms, and other things that made a difference.
All these rights were fought over with a great deal of ardour, but in retrospect they proved to be a much bigger and more lasting victory than the increase in the share of wages, which disappeared in the heights of inflation that characterized the postwar period and up to 1990, as many remember.
The appeal to the establishment of a general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of the credit unions, the labor movement came to the conclusion that their boards should appoint representatives of the trade unions and credit unions alike.
In the years following the founding of the Funds, the demand for a majority of the staff on the board of directors of the Funds was often discussed in wage-earning organisations, but it never came to fruition, and so we still have the unethical practice of having representatives of the Funds not forming a majority on the board of directors of the Funds.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the liability insurance of pension rights and the operation of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
Paragraph 1 states that the pension fund must be guided by the interests of the members of the trust.
Chapter 5 also states: 'A pension fund shall set ethical standards in its investment.'
The provisions of the pension scheme of the Merchants' Pension Fund, which continue the above provisions, include the following:
The pension fund is a party to the United Nations Regulations on Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the Western Hemisphere and Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and social issues and good corporate governance can contribute to improving the investment-friendliness of securities markets.
This brings together the interests of investors and the objectives of the wider society.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, set public policies on: maintaining good governance, corporate social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gildi pension fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has a 'responsible investment policy' and similar provisions.
All of this is brought up here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic buzzword, "shadow management".
As the term is used in this case, I do not expect it to have been defined in a proper way, but the following definition seems to me to be the most appropriate: shadow management is when the head of a limited liability company tells the media that he is going to send a recommendation or an order to the members of the board of directors of the pension fund on how to take a position on a particular matter.
If they fail to follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest opportunity.
If the manager does not take this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, then it is not shadow management. Such interactions between people are always there, of course, in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll leave it to the reader to decide which way he finds more acceptable.
There are two men in particular who have been trying to formulate this definition as of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Mr. E. Egisson, a journalist for the newspaper Fréttablad, and Mr. Ásgeir Jónsson, the head of the central bank.
The incident occurred after Icelandair's CEO Bogi Nils Bogason had announced his intention to terminate the airline's contracts with airlines and airlines (and to terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Businessmen's Association, sent out recommendations to the company's representatives in the Board of Directors of the Businessmen's Pension Fund not to support the fund's potential purchase of shares in the company, or to announce that they would be allowed to terminate.
Some time later, Bogi Nil withdrew his decision and Ragnar Thor followed suit with his recommendations, which of course were aimed at Bog's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw no reason for Mr. and Mrs. Herd to dwell on the matter in the Friday edition of the newspaper, with its big words about shadow government, crime, and the urgent need for legal reform.
There, a small pot would certainly have been a heavy load, even if the blessed pot had been in contact and had dried out quickly.
Since this is a matter of importance, let us consider the subject itself at the end.
I have already mentioned the provisions of the Pension Fund Act which relate to this matter.
It is the duty of the fund managers to protect the interests of the fund managers and to have an ethical framework for investments, and these points are elaborated in the resolutions of both Gildis and the Merchants' Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profit-making objectives in their investments.
Such a policy would be just as dangerous, and we need not look far back in time, as large loans from banks and funds have been given to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The Icelandair CEO was clearly on the verge of a complete layoff, thus significantly reducing the company's popularity in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he saw through it and pulled it back.
Time will tell whether the investment of a pension fund in the Society qualifies as a trust when it is established.

One of the infected was not home-bound
One of the three people who tested positive for Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived from the Baltic States on July 15 last, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who is not a resident here and therefore did not receive clear instructions to maintain the so-called homecoming curfew after arrival in the country and to go for another sample a few days after arrival.
He got a negative on a border patrol.
"But he is in an Icelandic society and should actually be treated", says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the field of preventive medicine at Landlækni and a substitute for a preventive medicine doctor during his summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttablaðið today.
He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to enter the identification number and if the identification number is not registered you are not automatically invited to the later sample.
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad but because of his connection in the country as an Icelander he should have preferred to use it in Icelandic.
He did not notice this.
If the identifier is not registered, you will need to apply for the second sample yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to realize that this was the right course", says Kamilla.
So it's clear that we need to increase the information on this while we find some way to automate the system even though Icelanders don't register their ID.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in Icelandic society in the registration system, she explains.
Fortunately, the person concerned did not arrive in Iceland, although he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to the hospital since he was diagnosed yesterday, and those six were all with him.
They are yet to be tested, but two of them have started to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man tested negative at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he was so recently infected that she could not yet detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not bring the virus to the country.
"It is not entirely possible to argue that this is definitely an infection because it is so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sport".
She says that's highly unlikely, though, because of the few people around here.
"It's actually very unlikely", says Kamilla, but adds that it cannot be ruled out until the human virus has been sequenced by Icelandic geneticists.
If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that he brought it to the mainland.
Pipes and explosives used against protesters
There was a clash between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police sprayed protesters with pepper spray and improvised explosive devices, while protesters broke wheels and set fire to them.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police brutality and racial discrimination were protested across the United States last night, but the Seattle demonstration was in support of the Portland, Oregon, protest.
In Austin, Texas, a protester was shot to death.
According to BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered for a peaceful protest.
Then mobs set fire to a construction site and broke the wheels of the city courthouse.
Police subsequently declared the protest unlawful and clashes broke out between a group of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was shot dead by police last August, was remembered by protesters.
A car crashed into a crowd of protesters in the city, but no one was hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of Black National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot dead by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and went to closed-door street demonstrations in the states, where police identified the group as a group of people who protested the protests and also carried firearms.
The 75th arrest was in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Sunshine: Not the Game that Defines Our Era
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Manchester United manager, doesn't want to overstate the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final round of the Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea don't lose to Wolves, Solskjaer and his men will finish fifth and lose a place in the Champions League.
They would still hope to reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We're not at the end of the line.
If we score against Leicester I think people will say we haven't had a bad season", said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to cover by catching the two teams above us", Solskjær said.
Obviously, people are getting nervous at 3:00 today, but Solskjaer tried to pretend that it was just another game.
If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to the pressure of the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and it is what the Society is built on.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is our turn to take advantage of it", said Solskjær.
This isn't the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The outcome does not define our era, we have already had many moments to define this era.
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think that overall we are in better shape and much stronger spiritually than last season", Solskjær said.
65,000 infections per day of the year
65,490 new coronavirus cases were reported in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed in the West Sea since the start of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but the last four days before that, the death toll from the virus was more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a report by CNN, the U.S. Department of Defense estimates that the death toll from the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15.
Fear of the Second Wave of the Pandemic
The Spanish government is now trying to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No new cases have been reported in a single day since early May, and the floods come as Spain begins lifting one of the strictest travel bans in Europe.
The backlash led the British authorities to require passengers arriving from Spain to take a walk-in class on their return.
A week ago, Spain was on the UK's list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where the government has resorted to more extensive restrictions in an attempt to keep interest rates level.
In the capital city of Barcelona, theaters will be closed for the next two weeks and nursing homes will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in place for 200,000 people in the province of Segria, in western Catalonia.
The UK's decision is expected to have a negative impact on Spain's economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign tourists and has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but little interest seems to be shown in re-opening the massive export ban that has devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken it very seriously, comparing it to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
The French Prime Minister, Jean Castex, has said that the nation would not survive, economically or socially, if it were again subjected to a national curfew.
Many ministers hope that local measures that reach the population of individual towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to contain the virus in its next round, if it does occur.
Five new cases in Iceland - three in the country
Three cases were reported in the country yesterday, plus two more at the border.
Five people tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday in Iceland.
The public health report says one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football game.
He has been sent to solitary confinement with sixteen others who were in close contact with him for six months.
The infected person was involved in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the report, "only part of the sports team" in Stikki.
Others sent in the so-called "sandwich" relate to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and a full-scale outbreak is underway with the FBI's infection team.
The organisers of the ReyCUP have followed the guidelines and rules of the Public Health and Public Safety Committee still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
Though pictures of the match yesterday attracted attention as they were seen in very close company celebrating the good performance of their team out on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the hosts posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says, "Parents, please respect the rules that contestants bring their own suitcases to school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.
The second infection was reported yesterday, but it's related to the infection reported the day before.
The report states: "The Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infection and revealed a new strain of virus that has not been detected here before".
The infection is also being investigated, with one infected person in isolation and 12 in isolation due to the infection.
The third message in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
It was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He's in solitary with six people who were in close contact with him in the past.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two cases were reported at the border and the results of further investigations such as the border inspection process are awaited.
The report concludes: "The Public Safety Department of the Federal Police and the State Medical Examiner's Office urge people to exercise caution and to consider personal protective equipment.
If there is any doubt as to whether symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go for a test at the next health facility.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is booked for a businessman weekend - direct visitors to another
The Patrick's Field campground is fully booked for the weekend, according to a press release from West Building.
Guests are encouraged to consider other accommodation options.
It names the Westside town of Billdudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes on Red Sand, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the station.
There is plenty to be seen on Patrick's Square this weekend, as last year, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the charges at the campsite, we can expect a good meeting this year, if the weather doesn't put a damper on the count, but DV said earlier today of a more effortful forecast.
We can expect the worst weather to come from the south, and we can expect the St. Patrick's Day.
The bb.is website was the first to report, saying that all the other accommodations in the town were already booked.
Whole apartment building burns down in the best location in town
Romanian workers live free on Dunhaga 1820.
Meanwhile, the owners are applying for building permits for renovation, but their efforts have been successful in the system for the third year in a row.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods in Reykjavik, a large three-story apartment building is located.
The ground floor of the building has about 2,000 square feet [600 sq m] of retail space.
Behind the house are two staircases, each containing four rather large apartments.
They range from about 1,300 to 1,300 square feet, though most are over 100 feet.
The house has a lot of history to tell.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, the video store, the Forestry Institute, the Milk Assembly's dairy, the Jóa gun factory, a fish market and, most recently, the University Press.
The house, as far as we can tell, has a mind of its own, a foolish beauty.
The house is now heavily damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying photographs.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the company register, D18 ehf. is owned by Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus went for the Borgunar ownership group and was a defender of the Borgunar ownership association.
The Borgunar holding company is owned by the Steel Ship.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of the Virgin Mary and her children.
Gudrún also owns a third of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once started the design of the Steel Ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore been kept virtually empty since then.
Tell the neighbors that the house has deteriorated steadily since then, though mostly in recent years.
On the neighborhood's Facebook page, one resident says the house hasn't been particularly lively for the past few years.
This may indicate that the owners have been considering making changes to the house and grounds for several years.
Other neighbors say the house has been in disrepair for a long time.
It's about time we did something public about this patch and it's boring that it's gone like this.
He also says he's pissed at the owners for not putting in the effort to finish this, find some common ground with the neighbors and stop this legal debacle.
"Just do it in consultation with the community around you so you can get on with it and get it done".
The "legal step" referred to by the resident is the planning process of the scheme, which has been in place since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor above the existing apartment building and a new elevator and one-story addition with basements behind the building.
The building permit for this project was referred to the Environmental and Resources Committee, which revoked it on the grounds that the project was not partitioned and the planning was not satisfactory.
Reykjavík City then started with a division planning work and completed it with an advertisement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
That plan was also rejected and the committee withdrew it in March 2020.
By this time, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house were in the process of starting.
By this time the house had fallen into disrepair, and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the neighbors' reactions, the answers were mixed.
Some understood the intentions of the homeowner, others did not.
Some directed their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily out of nowhere.
Still others said the parking lot was a waste of time, but neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 1820 parking lot under their vehicles.
One of the plaintiffs in the case said, exhausted by the administration:
That we have to go through the process of triangulation is absolutely incredible.
It's as if Reykjavik City couldn't read.
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A memorial to the stages of the city's administration and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of work of those who are now in the early stages.
When a reporter drove into a park on Dunhaga 18, he was blown away by a galloping door and a garbage chute.
A Playstation computer and a new TV were among the second-biggest waste dumps on earth  victims of the Icelandic summer blast.
The opening was in the old office of the University Prince and there were a number of cats, judging by the country's luck.
Clearly, someone has been crammed into one corner but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few sheets of geological papers, which were doubtless to become a book, were blown up.
The staircases of the apartment building were open as well as alive.
A journalist was lucky enough to report on the inhabitants of another of them.
There, Romanians were eating potatoes for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the labor union Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time, and military sources tell us the company paid nothing for the building except for heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not defensible to collect the rent.
Judging from the old post office in the windy house, it is clear that a number of foreign workers have lived there in recent times.
The labour market has not taken into account the Covid-19 situation, the end of the tourism contraction has led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two sectors have been the most efficient in using the labour market services.
Nevertheless, the household at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do, and the workplaces and the floors of the community hung to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the dismal condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed well maintained.
When a reporter called the boys in Romanian, the situation became clear: In the best part of Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of real estate were being demolished.
The owners want to make the house better and the neighbors want to improve it but they're arguing about the definition of "improved".
Between then and now, the city's planning department is in the early stages, the victim of endless appeals and litigation in the planning process, and the elected Environmental and Resource Adjudicatory Committee.
The house is occupied by Romanian workers, perhaps the very ones who will improve the situation when the Icelanders stop fighting.

Fighting obesity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will donate £10 million to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on instant messaging, following his severe illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is scheduled to launch the campaign, which has been dubbed Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to report bikes to their overweight patrons and will also be tackled by the increase in cycling.
According to British media sources, fast-food advertisements will be banned on television until 9 p.m.
COVID-19 has awakened us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is adamant that we must use this time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier, a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was placed in intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus this spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women better fall in to lead the change
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater decentralization, transparency and in working against corruption and in the interests of the whole.
We need to start changing things up a bit now, and who better to lead change than the social group that has the easiest time to be in these values?
There are women, said Helga.
Icelandic women are famous for their femininity.
Standing together and being together in leading change.
So now it's just up to us to lead the change.
She said she was a bit upset about the focus on Iceland as the best in the world in both gender and human rights.
Then we're not as ready to consider what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they're very aware of their history and consider everything that needs to be done.
It's a cliff.
We need to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the lines of the conservative groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here, said Helga.
She said that women are in many ways good in Iceland, but added that as elsewhere, Icelanders are built on very masculine values.
She said that politics was about shaping self-interest, dominance and power as the forces that sustained injustice in all societies.
"Women are now starting to form this group and coming together and they're just getting a little bit annoyed that the Althing is going to look past this referendum of 2012", she said.
It's these feminine values that we're thinking about.
Apart from human rights and the protection of nature, cooperation and the fact that we are all really at the same table, she said, adding that the above values were fundamental to the new constitution.
We are a country rich in natural resources and it is ridiculous that people here live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can trade differently", said Helga.
It is ridiculous that it is some kind of natural law that women's jobs are always lower paid.
It is ridiculous that airlines and nurses have to endlessly stand in line just to get a decent wage.
You can sign the new constitution here via electronic Iceland.
Attempted to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after threatening pedestrians and trying to extort money from him.
Police also stopped drug production in Arba where two were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped a motorcycle driver in the Hlídny, where the driver was traveling at a speed of 146 km/h, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had been deprived of his driving privileges in the past.
The Metropolitan Police had enough to go around at night, and there were over 80 cases recorded in the police log from 5 p.m. yesterday to 5 a.m. this morning.
There was a particular emphasis on noise-related complaints.
The following Saturday, 11 reports of violent clashes were reported in the police diary.
But last night, 22 cases of violence were reported to the police.
Six were kept in detention cells overnight.
In the village, police were called in last night when the airplanes were fired into the air.
However, they were already avoiding the police officer's approach.
Nine drivers were arrested for drunk driving and/ or drug-related offenses.
Four were arrested for a fight in the city centre last night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Two were taken to the emergency room after falling on their faces, one in the center and the other in the West.
One was taken to the emergency room after he was injured while jumping off a trampoline in Copenhagen.
In addition, officers stopped a motorcycle driver who was pulling a bicycle at Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police log, the bicycle equipment in the house was in "very poor condition" and was parked.
Staying at the Monet house for the businessman's weekend.
The house where the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his life is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next few nights in the house are for the shopping weekend.
The house is small and spicy, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet first found inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you're thinking of renting the house, you'll have to rent it for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb, the next store will be closed in a week, on the Sunday of the shopping holiday, so it might be a good idea for some shoppers on holiday to rush to book the painter's house.
The two nights of a businessman's weekend cost only $964, or just over $130,000, depending on what the next issue of the magazine says.
Dozens of cases, some of them showing symptoms of coronavirus
Five cases of the coronavirus have been reported domestically in the last three days, and most of the cases are unrelated.
Dozens have been infected, and some have begun to show symptoms of the virus.
Three confirmed coronavirus cases in the country yesterday and two at the border checkpoint.
A rural health official says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading to other communities.
It's been sequenced since the first domestic outbreak, and it's a virus that hasn't been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe it's been hiding in the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the country but of course we need to be very careful now", said Kamilla Sigrid Josefsdottir, an expert in the field of military defence of the country's medical office.
Most of those infected have been in contact with people who came from abroad.
More tests are coming, but some people who were in contact with the infected have started to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"There is no flu now and there are fewer respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal in doing this test on people who at the time of the flu would have found a reason to do something else first", Kamilla said.
The infection control is largely complete, but it is not excluded that more people may have to go into quarantine.
The two infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
This has raised questions about the justification for such an event.
The Public Defender's communications officer will say it slowly as long as people follow orders and regulations.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible that the infected were infected at the sports events.
If these individuals do not go into isolation after being exposed to them in these sports, then we can say that our precautions at the conventions have worked.
But that's not clear", said Kamilla.
The Public Defender's project is under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary", Kamilla said.
In less than a week, the crowd restriction will be raised to 1,000.
This new location could affect circumstances.
Determined meditation on cooking - See the menu of Elisa Aydars
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a football player and plays with Val.
She's also a nutrition major, a mother, and a nutritionist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's activities, and she usually spends time cooking a good, nutritious meal.
"My normal day starts at 8 a.m"., says Elisa.
After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before picking up my girl at kindergarten at about 3:00 p.m.
Elisa finds it very important to pick up her daughter early for kindergarten.
It's good to have some time with her before I go to practice the second part.
It's nice to come home after a workout and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we enjoy watching a program to clear our minds.
Elisha does not follow a strict diet.
She is finishing her master's degree in nutrition, so she knows exactly what to eat to keep her energized for work, school, family, and exercise.
 I am comfortable eating a variety of foods that are well-balanced with protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food as bad or good, rather as nutritious or nutritionally deficient.
It is okay to eat everything, but not all at once and not all the time.
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
I find it very meditative to stand in the kitchen and cook, and I really enjoy it.
I have to say that I have confidence in the kitchen, and I believe wholeheartedly that I am a good cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, and left in almond milk for the night.
Then top this meal with whatever is available each time.
Usually it's banana and jellyfish & CAFFE.
I'm a big coffee woman.
Millimeter: Incredibly mismatched, but fruit or vegetables, flatbreads, clean shirts with bananas and mussels, bread with vegetables and then I could eat hummus with a spoon from the box if that's okay.
Lunch: I often prepare all kinds of delicious salads from the fridge, china or beans, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dressing is a bit of what I'm working on.
If the plan goes completely out of hand (which happens a lot), then the egg machine at work has saved me quite a lot of times and that's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and sour eggs, don't put any more on you.
Millimeter: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for exercise, bread with vegetables, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice at my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Police and protesters clash in Seattle
City officials in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of emergency in response to mass protests in the city.
Police yesterday used explosives and pipe bombs to attempt to clear a large area occupied by protesters, who stormed several buildings near the city's parliament building.
Police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into the damage done to a police station in the city yesterday, possibly by some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say protesters have beaten police with rocks, bottles, balloons and other loose materials, and one police officer was taken to hospital for treatment.
The Seattle demonstration, however, was peaceful long before.
The bomb was intended to show solidarity with protesters in Portland, Oregon, a city that has been mired in violent clashes between protesters and heavily armed local federal police.
There, as in other cities in the United States, people gathered under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding redress.
Not withdrawn until after a vote
It is not yet known whether the cancellations of Icelandair flights, which are due to take effect at the next monthly meeting, will be withdrawn.
The electronic vote on the air carrier's charter agreement on behalf of Icelandair's operations will end tomorrow at noon.
The chairman of the association, Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissals until the results of the vote are known.
"It's clearly connected", says the Goddess Line.
No cancellations have been made, it must be done so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are anxious to know if they will have a job after the end of their period.
The vote is on a contract signed a week ago, on July 19.
The agreement is expected to run until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement previously voted on by airlines.
On 17 July, the board of directors and the board of trustees of the Icelandic Airline Association agreed to announce the general strike of Icelandair, which was approved by the members in a vote.
It never came, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to stop talks with the airline, cancel all its flights and seek contracts with another state-owned airline.
The pilots of the company were to take on the duties of temporary security guards.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Godlaug Liney says it's hard to say.
People are hurt by this approach in Iceland, when all the airlines were cancelled and it was announced that the airline would be merged with another subsidiary.
Now we'll see if it has an effect", she says.
Icelandair had 940 aircraft in service at the end of April, but 900 of them, or about 95%, were cancelled.
Their notice period is a misnomer, for those with a longer period of service it is three months, and therefore ends around the end of July/August.
That group comprises about 90% of Icelandic air traffic.
What happens if the deal is not approved?
So we'd like to continue our conversations with our subjects.
With this agreement, we are meeting the demands of Icelanders.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the airlines have gone too far.
The vote on the settlement agreement ends and Icelandair will present its second quarter results tomorrow.
The airline vote on the new airline agreement will end at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second quarter results will also be released tomorrow, but emergency supplemental data indicate that the company's revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic vote on the agreement between the Icelandic Airline Association and the Icelandic Confederation of Trade Unions began on Wednesday, July 22 and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
The contract is to be voted on by Icelandair employees who pay a membership fee to the airline.
The new agreement was signed by Icelandair and FFÍ on the evening of Sunday 19 July, but on the previous Friday Icelandair had suspended negotiations with the airline after the airlines voted down the previous agreement in early July.
At that time, Icelandair had told all its airlines and teams to call it off on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new agreement was signed.
Under the new framework, airlines must fly five hours more per month for the same basic wage.
The framework agreement is valid until 2025 but has agreed on the terms and conditions for pilots and airlines to fly for one shift.
The agreement was announced to the FIA members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, and described several airlines that news agencies discussed at the time over dissatisfaction with the agreement.
However, the majority seemed to agree that the agreement should be approved in order to keep the FIFG alive.
Icelandair's second-quarter results will be presented tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating income before capital and taxes, is negative according to the emergency fund extra data of USD 100 to 110 million or about ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Chamber of Commerce emergency accounts last Wednesday, saying that the company's revenue for the quarter amounted to about $60 million, or about $8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately US$154 million at the end of the quarter, or approximately DKK 21 billion.
Icelandair also intends to offer its shares in August.
Icelandair intends to complete agreements with 15 creditors, the government and the aircraft manufacturer Boeing by the end of the month before the start of the public offering.
New Variation Rather Than a New Type of Virus
"New virus" simply means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been reported in the country, says Már Kristjánsson, chief medical officer at the Infectious Diseases Department of the Land Hospital, about the reports that a new type of virus has been detected in the country.
Three cases were reported inland yesterday and two at the border.
One of the infected had participated in a social work project of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is unknown and the transmission is ongoing.
A person who arrived in the country on 15 July was also infected and two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID19.
Then yesterday, an infection was detected that was related to a previous infection that was detected the day before. And after a sequence analysis by the Icelandic Genetic Survey, a new strain of virus was detected that had not been detected here before.
The infection control is complete in connection with that infection.
It is now noted that this is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread worldwide, namely the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to speak of a new variant of the virus than of a new strain of the virus.
Asked what that means and whether it could indicate that another wave of the pandemic has begun, Már says that it is a coincidence and that it could be nothing more.
However, if there are domestic cases that are not linked to foreign countries and have the same heritage as this particular variant, then a decision could be made [on the second wave] but it is untimely to support such a decision", explains Már.
The Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness in hot pots?
BBC journalists lead the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country's pool and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing is unique worldwide, and it is said that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing sites per capita.
Natural geothermal heat is the basis, but so is the tradition of sunbathing.
Although the education of children was legalized in 1940, older citizens are still unable to use the hot water for healing purposes.
Tourism is described as an integral part of the country's general welfare.
In this pot, everyone is equal, regardless of rank or status.
Without cell phones, people are chatting about home and space on personal notes or using the symbolic power of water: meditating and charging the batteries of the soul and body.
On the brink of a hundred days of elections
One hundred days until the American people go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he still has a lot of work to do.
Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has a significant lead over Trump nationally, according to the polls.
According to a recent AP poll, the American population believes the nation is headed in the wrong direction.
Trump's response to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unfavorable, and more Americans are counting than before the president's bad economic record.
According to one estimate, only two out of ten Americans think the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say he's been good about the economy.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight poll, Biden's national approval rating is 49.9 percent, while Trump's is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance on the pandemic to Biden, pushing for so-called cultural divide and announcing policies that are supposed to turn to law and order.
The Biden campaign, however, is very focused on keeping Trump in the spotlight and believes it has a good chance of winning a by-election if the election is really about how Trump has positioned himself in office over the past four years.
Trump's displeasure also seems to be going down on Republican lawmakers, and Progressives fear that Democrats might even win a Senate majority, which has so far been pretty good.
Politico reported that in the days when party and candidate tracking was held in parity, it's now the Republican Party would get its biggest poll in decades.
The party's performance was particularly poor in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like this trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to scare the suburbs into following suit, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will devastate the suburbs of the United States and push racial segregation.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a White House bill from the Obama era that was meant to increase diversity in suburbs.
Then he encouraged a U.S. Housewoman to read an article by a former New York lieutenant governor, in which she argued that Biden would destroy U.S. spaceships and signed Trump to it.
Both will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!
The suburbs of the United States are a growing constituency.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the candidate who receives the most votes from this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney got a majority of the vote from that group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that even though Trump secured a narrow majority in the 2016 election, his followers there have been significantly drawn down.
While it varies between states, Biden has recommended a 15 percent lead over Trump in recent presidential elections.
Regis Philbin is dead.
American television personality Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin's career as an actor, host, presenter, and singer spanned six decades.
He is best known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also hosted shows on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent the most hours on American television and has been recognized for that matter.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated a total of 37 times.
A statement from his family says Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media over the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic flame be lit at the end of the runway?
After the final decision to postpone the Olympics, an event that has only been delayed by two world wars, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be the light at the end of the tunnel, presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now facing together.
Africans have one more year to prepare, and Japanese authorities are adding to the cost of the delay.
Everyone is holding their heads up a lot.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would host the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese delegates were not disappointed.
They cried and laughed in exchange, eventually Tokyo's bid for the 2016 Games was turned down to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to be the focus of world attention.
The Games were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If the Games cannot be held, if the coronavirus is still too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.
But nobody wants to think about it.
The Olympics are not a normal sporting event.
Nothing to spare, the show must always be spectacular and try to top the last game.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the judgement of the selection committee on the bids of the cities.
The more spectacular the presentation, the greater the chances of getting the nose.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or a whopping $15 billion.
Later, when the 2020 Games were announced, $75 million was put into the promotion.
In 2013, when Tokyo was chosen to host the Games this year, the Japanese government had already budgeted about $15 billion for the project.
But that is a small amount of money when compared with the cost of building an Olympic village, a sports stadium, and, in general, building up the country's infrastructure to host, prepare for, and host the Games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were scheduled to take place today but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by the Japanese Auditor General released late last year estimated that the cost would be nearly double that figure.
It is unlikely that the cost of postponing the games will be fully quantified, but it has been estimated that it could cost between $2 billion and $6 billion in addition to the original cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
So high are the figures that the entire Icelandic government's tax revenue was enough for only about half the Olympic Games, given the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are such a massive event that they have become the subject of eager attention by economists, who try to digest the numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, it seems that many have concluded that the Olympic Games have a positive but negative effect on the economies of the host cities.
Short-term effects are some, such as a large increase in jobs in the short term, but in the long term cities are happy to stay afloat with debt and the enormous operating costs of little-used man-made materials.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is heavily in debt because of the 2016 Olympics and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.
A study of post-Olympic London 2012 figures revealed that only 10 percent of those employed in the city had been unemployed.
That means that there was no question of new employment except to a small extent.
Cities have generally not been particularly financially successful in hosting the Olympics because of the high cost of man-made structures.
However, the benefits are seen in the increased tourist traffic to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is highly uncertain about the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether the entire audience that normally attends the games will be able to be accommodated.
The main issue, though, is the honor that cities claim to be elected, but it is difficult to measure by wealth.
For despite the enormous cost, the pleasure of the games is not of a price-setting nature.
But while the exhibition is spectacular and there is no saving, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some African people, postponing the games is a welcome surprise.
Australian five-sport athlete and Olympic gold medalist Chloe Esposito, for example, is a champion and would have been far from a good age this summer but hopes to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
She is thus among those athletes who are just rather content with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after the games this year, if they had been held in time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they will retire before the games take place.
Just don't trust your body to go through a year of extra hard work.
Few athletes impressed the audiences of the 2016 Rio Olympics as much as five-time Olympic champion Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his native United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is looking forward to the 2021 Games, but she is not sure if she will be able to stay at the top of the Games next year, when she turns 24.
Although not generally considered a high age, it is in the top five for a female actor.
"It's a sensitive issue", Biles says, but smiles at another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she plans to reach the same distance at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll be at the top after a whole year of extra practice", says Biles.
She has previously said that her body can no longer cope with the stress of gymnastics.
However, she is training for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was uncomfortable to have to stop practicing suddenly at the height of the Great Depression and the closing of the cinema.
No exceptions were made for Biles more than for others while all athletic activities were suspended for seven weeks.
All her Olympic golds couldn't buy any more access than the others, she had to find ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
The basic shape of the eye is certainly better than most people.
We have a rigid plan now.
It was difficult to start practicing again after the opening of the Cinematheque.
We started off slow, but we're back on track, and I'm going to increase the practice evenly and intensively as the year goes on.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we're still practicing given that they will be, we can't help it.
"I've put too much into it to quit the sport now", says Biles.
Like many others, she is blinded by the possibility that the Games may not be held in 2021 either.
However, it is hopeless to predict.
No one can know what the state of the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021, and there is nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held every year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid corridor.
A Wedding Delayed by a Pestilence
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus pandemic.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now", the actress told People.
We definitely want to get married one day and have that dream wedding and have all the people we love there.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what's important right now, and that's helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm more into worldly things than weddings these days.
There is much going on, and we should pay attention to what is happening in the world.
