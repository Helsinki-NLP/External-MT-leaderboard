A study published on Monday in the journal Science found a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have shown that new species evolve in just two generations, although this process is believed to take longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's caterpillar, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus caterpillar, Geospiza conirostris.

Segregation and recombination move back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to replenish its amino acids from available wood resources.

The oldest wood source is protein extracted from leaves and nuts, but these are hard to digest by primates like us unless they are eaten.
In contrast, animal manure (monkey, cow, beef) is not only digestible, but also provides protein in high content containing all essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own grandmothers solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
