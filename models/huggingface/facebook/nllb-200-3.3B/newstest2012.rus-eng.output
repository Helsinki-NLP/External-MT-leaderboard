Parliament does not support the amendment that frees Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected the attempt to abolish the article that convicted opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
An amendment that would have resulted in the release of the jailed former prime minister was rejected during the second reading of a bill to reduce sentences for economic crimes.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia that was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process has also been suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already had losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to determine the winners.
Islamists are usually the winners in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the Sharia common law that we have heard about before.
Libya will be a crime-free country, because the penalty for stealing is the amputation of the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
Libya will have a system that we cannot imagine, and that we would hardly wish for ourselves.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor the best and would probably not be suitable for the Libyan population, for example.
It's actually surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only excuse was that they believed the NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they praised after each strike.
And if you look for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We've been in the crossfire, serving Islam, and our politicians have gotten rid of a dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of return.
Given the recent unfortunate experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, need not worry about the expulsion of the "Crusaders".
But without the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya's black gold for practically nothing?
And the West will finally be able to boast of its selfless defense of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Sharia put an end to it.
A new wave of the crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
The statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have released their GDP figures for the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, while Germany and France showed growth.
And yet, the debt market is hitting new highs today.
Investors are not just looking at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France's by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter figures, with Germany doing better than expected (up 0.3% from 0.1%), and France reporting a slight decline of 0.1% (initial data suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year , the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5% .
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation, which confirmed the trend of gradual slowing of economic growth, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economies of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts' forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
Her 10-year bond yield is 28.45%.
The yields of both Italian and Spanish bonds are approaching the tipping point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are starting to have difficulties.
Despite the worsening situation in the region, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, they say that the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech national team qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0, celebrating a surprise cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully completed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to a great Czech and a beautiful goal by Petr Jiracek, they won 1-0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to maintain a significant advantage after the home-and-away match, and will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and compiled a detailed report.
Hardly any action in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly because of the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yiracek; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates their European Championship.
The Czech team's excellent defense allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovic and Vucinich were the worst pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The great Petr Čech is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty with the combination; the game was played in the center of the field most of the time.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the home team in the first half.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a human shield.
A few hundred university students created a human shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon, the students prayed before entering the building, followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In doing so, they have demonstrated their willingness to protect their country's nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that evidence shows that Iran has not given up trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, at noon, students prayed before the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, followed by a prayer for the destruction of both the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximising the paralysis of Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would be, according to the Israeli press, the installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition for children with obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight; while 9 percent of school-age children are overweight, 5 percent are obese.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from obesity are usually from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of environment and patterns of behavior to a person's healthy development.
For example, sausage is nearly twice as likely to be on the tables of obese children than in families with normal-weight children.
More than 19 percent of obese children ate French fries for dinner the night before the survey, which was part of an educational event called "Obesity is not an accident".
Moreover, families with obese children do not exercise, but this is true for the majority of families with school-age children today - only 15% of children said that their parents make time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was done on 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year; nearly 900 primary school students from all over Bohemia participated in it.
The event Obesity is not an accident was held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils from grades 4-8 have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate exercise are the main determining factors behind the rapidly increasing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they eat five meals a day, breakfast-breakfast-lunch-breakfast-dinner, which is a prerequisite for proper nutrition", says one study.
No lunch and sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even such minor details as a regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school-age families eat breakfast together.
Most families have separate breakfast.
The worst finding was that one in ten families don't eat breakfast at all.
And yet, breakfast is the foundation of a healthy diet.
The study found that fried foods are more commonly consumed in families with children who are obese.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 percent of children are regularly involved in sports, this number more than doubles to 15 percent when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu, based on the food they were offered and their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating".
Their favorite foods include a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"The high popularity of sugary soft drinks is of particular concern", says the study's conclusion.
As the main meal, the pasta beat the bird with a little overweight.
However, the children showed little interest in beans, fish, or vegetables.
The pursuit of a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits if given the right information.
"Many of the control group participants showed a significant shift in preference towards healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after the lecture", the project said.
This was especially true in the case of sugary soft drinks, where more children were choosing water over sugary soft drinks.
In addition, children were more likely to choose poultry and fish as their main dishes, limiting the amount of sweet dishes and pastries.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on stylist training, I complained about the amount of information in the introductory class.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; advice on how to dress for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
More down the road.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments await us.
Training is every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really packed with information.
This time with Alenka, the principal, (there are no men in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has a boyish figure without proper form, another weighs more than normal.
A stylist must know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to accentuate the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, who have larger breasts and smaller hips and smaller waists, and not dress too revealingly.
For example, if the difference in waist and hip volume is so great that you can't fit a skirt or pants, you might want to have at least one item custom made.
You're not going to regret the investment, because perfectly fitting clothing is priceless.
A custom-made skirt will make you feel much better than one that's constantly falling off, rolling over, exposing your waist, and so on.
The owner of a boy's figure, on the other hand, may wear clothes with ruffles, applique, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of this information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to figure it all out.
Still, I'm afraid it's a little much, considering the homework we've been given.
Each participant had to design two outfits for a celebrity: one for the day and one for the evening.
We have to consider their modern appearance, their style of clothing and their body type.
I'm going to be wearing Miranda Kerr, who you may know from Victoria's Secret commercials.
I'm happy for myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained a ton of weight (please note that I'm exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print them and then process them with graphic software.
The board of paintings, the result of the work, then reflects our own style and attitude towards the graphic.
It's important to keep in mind the graphic component of style.
The stylist does not just dress real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on specific indications, for example, fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenick told us.
But it was only Sunday.
A stylist needs a general knowledge.
Saturday's lecture, rich with information about the types of figures, was animated by three guests who are experts in this field.
The stylist is Honza Pokorna; the fashion designer is Jacob Polanka; and the fashion photographer is Ben Renz.
Yaqub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should take advantage of this fact.
A good stylist knows how to use the same garment in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn casually, over jeans and T-shirts, as a coat; but it can also be worn on the bare body, without buckles, as a dress.
Another option is to roll up your sleeves or raise your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with it", he insisted.
However, the advice I appreciated most was this: "For your job, you should know the rules perfectly".
Then you can start breaking them,' Yaqub told us.
And here I finally understand why we're all so obsessed with definitions and rules, what to pair with what and why, when in fashion magazines we often see something quite different.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
I learned from Beena, a photographer, that a stylist has more outfits than she has pictures to take.
So, for a fashion review of ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in a picture, the garment often looks and acts in combination with others quite differently than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a great vocal, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
Attitude towards stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often find it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and how they look is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to name a different (smaller) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about any celebrity getting fat, losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to know fashion and be able to pick out a wardrobe.
Our job is basically to interact with the people we dress; that's why it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to patronize them, and to have my own opinion.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are awful".
"Find at least a few things that you can commend, and suggest what you can wear with them", Mario says.
He also showed us exactly what the work bag should hold.
It's a bag that you wrap around your waist to carry all the essentials.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, a sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylers use it when shooting some items, for example, a bag or a hat), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too big (the shoes and similar items are prohibited, as they spoil the clothes) or a sewing kit.
To get away from the lecture and get some practical experience, we learned how to make the right shoe soles.
Even when shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged - not to mention shooting in the street.
So we started to glue.
You shouldn't touch the shoes with the scissors, otherwise they'll be ruined.
It takes real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills you mentioned.
This is just some of what we heard during the second half of the weekend's classes.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as people say.
V for Speed: Escape is set in America.
The overview
What should have been a carefree walk turned into a routine morning commute to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were satisfied to some extent, but it didn't matter, because no one wanted to do the extra work.
Before the new version with the subtitle "Escape" was released, there were high hopes.
It was expected to take the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions suggested that the game would take its place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see the part of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, things turn out differently than we expected.
The game is a fairly good arcade racing game, but the overall impression is marred by several unnecessary bugs that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, these are not really mistakes, but the inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story in which the main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You get in a car on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to be the first to New York.
There are some interesting aspects to this idea.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race is run on its own course, with individual stages taking place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the same thing is happening all the time.
Although the graphics are at the same level as in previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to look at.
But the game doesn't evoke any strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, the autumn suburbs, or high up in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
And the race is occasionally brought to life by an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you're in a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught in an avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you try to overtake several competitors (essentially a normal race); then you try to improve your time (a standard race with a stopwatch); or you compete with one opponent.
And, of course, you run into the police from time to time, which makes your job even more difficult.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack is running from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not that big a deal.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
It actually turns out that this is good for gaming, because it's a non-boring property; all things considered, it's one of the things that makes gaming more fun.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of the previous models.
It means that she's no longer special, but that's not a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a simulation of real life, you'll have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options on the market.
It's going very well so far.
But after a while, things start to go wrong.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect any complicated transformations or collisions from this game, but if you have no idea before you hit the object how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Normally, when you're overtaking or passing cars in a traffic jam, you'll occasionally touch the other car slightly, and yet sometimes in a situation that's very similar, your car will start to spin wildly.
Or it was a total wreck.
It's not that important because of the reboot system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are designed so that if you crash or go off the track, the game will return you to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use all of them, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful in case something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes the restarts aren't enough, and you have to memorize a section of the race.
A major drawback of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be done a certain way, otherwise you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you'll encounter civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration whether you're coming first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars going in opposite directions, whereas when you get there, the cars are already in position so that you have to either pass them or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; it's designed to be right in front of your face.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent is overtaking you in the same place.
This is especially apparent at the end of the game, on the long bridge, where you're driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand up to you no matter what.
The thing is, when it's driving in front of you, it makes it harder to see, which leads to one or more accidents in this station.
It's understandable to try to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-filled, but it's so obvious that it quickly becomes irritating.
It's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what keeps you entertained, whether it's a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races, or something else.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to keep track of the fuel tanks along the way, because that's where your car can be replaced, even though in most cases the one you already have is quite sufficient.
Cars fall into three categories.
Sports cars are for city driving; powerful American cars are for straight-track driving; and exotic super-sports are for technical driving, such as on curvy mountain trails.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it is racing through individual sections that you learn as you play.
Here you earn for your personal case both medals and points, common to the challenges and story modes.
There are many options available to get a higher level of driving, from cars to profile data.
The profile is also linked to the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your scores with those of other players, and provides a public link.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; this is an example from the last race in the sequence.
You and your car are in a subway tunnel (assuming that's what it is), where you're running along the tracks in the dark (assuming that's what it is).
Your speedometer is reading from 100 to 200 kilometers an hour, let's say, when suddenly a subway train comes up behind you, turning your car into a pile of junk.
For days, our editorial staff debated whether it was true that no one had given the game a second's thought, or whether the creators really thought we were such fools.
The technical aspect of the game is not particularly impressive, but the overall experience of the video game is mostly pleasant, sometimes even thrilling.
Although unfortunately, at some critical points, the quality of the recording, sometimes quite dramatically, decreases.
This is especially true in high-volume incidents where a good recording wouldn't do you much good either.
Sound is fine; soundtrack is for the amateur.
To appeal to the younger audience, the soundtrack 'includes a variety of styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is quite messy.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of incompletion.
Sure, it's fun, but be prepared to be blinded by the flaws, like an airport searchlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vitsenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unfriendly and skeptical of the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable disagreement among the various organizations".
"I didn't expect it to be such a brutal war".
"It will take five or six years before the situation will stabilize, calm down and all the players will get used to their new roles", EU Ambassador Milena Vitenova began her lecture at the law faculty with a stern tone.
She proved her commitment to her motto, "Europe Clear and Open", in the first part of her talk, where she described the EU institutions and their relationship in a way that many UC law professors would envy.
Moreover, Vitsenova praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, critics said he was a plain gray office mouse who couldn't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he did his part".
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member countries at the same time, who is a great communicator and who has a clear idea of where the EU should go".
She explained her new post as an international relations and security representative as an answer to the question: "What is the European Union? What number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody 's going to ban our cheese .
Vitsenova then focused on the programme, which is key for the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency successful in the year before last.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame that crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at that time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives in the EU are very busy at the moment.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis caused the current ferment.
And it also needs to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is not easy given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be tight and sparing, which areas will be given priority; which countries will receive more support and which less; all these questions are on the agenda.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "On Europe, in a language we understand".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curly or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs to European organisations.
A multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered to be Eurosceptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland or Hungary and we are joined by a Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says: 'Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad Group again?' and he's not happy about it.'
In the future, the Union of Vicenova expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of the member states.
Compared with the new European Federation, she sees the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe as more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation".
"It was said for the first time that countries that wanted to join should join, while those that didn't wanted to join could stay out".
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe", Vitsenov expects.
In this respect, she underlined the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all issues concerning the EU as a whole should be discussed by all member countries, not just those in the eurozone.
The story of the brand:
The pioneer IBM is entering its second century.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the strategy of IMB, the closest one will probably be "durable".
To the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be solved easily if people would just think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the future giant's life revolved (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson had carefully built.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constantly moving into the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, while not being afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, it has enabled us to transform technology, business and society.
In the next 100 years, we hope to achieve even more", says Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current president, on the occasion of the anniversary.
A complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of caring for employees in the same way that Batya did in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a sophisticated bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Equally advanced are IBM's long-term relationships with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company has found brilliant use for talented people, and it was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmisano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the director of sales, marketing and development.
For the last few years, IBM has been hosting meetings, online brainstorming sessions, where many of the innovations of the future are born.
It's no wonder that there are so many ideas - the company employs about half a million people.
An organization with a good reputation
A strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM was conceptually more of an organization than a technology company", Harvard Business School professor and IBM author Rosabeth Moss Kanter told The Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems with technology", adds George Coloney of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there's a difference between going to market and creating a market.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is known in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most all-inclusive technology company -- hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting, everything from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won Nobel Prizes.
Her inventions include, for example, the ATM, the bank card, the financial swap, the barcode and the floppy disk.
With $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM is the second-largest technology company this year, overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all of its products were to the taste of customers and fit the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is defined by moving forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past", says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is so easy to build on multiple platforms -- if they don't work, they'll drop them.
This is how it differs, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and survives the fall on Windows, its operating system.
The future of technology
IBM's main revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth of each coming from computer software and hardware.
In 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest hardware company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion of its undervalued assets, while investing $58 billion in promising technology.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was first hit by the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have been spared the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's stock price has risen a record 120 percent; the company's net income has been steadily rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
So it's to be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will be able to handle the situation.
The story of IBM: from the cheese knife to space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name, "Computing, Tabling, Recording Corporation", was a bit of a conundrum.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally a brand name used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history began in the 1880s.
They had technologies like the legendary "table clock", a clock that recorded when employees were coming and going from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also headed the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired a rival company's director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the CEO pushed the IBM founder into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the foundation of an unshakable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name implies, began by manufacturing and selling a variety of business equipment, from cheese knives and butcher knives to cash register machines.
During Watson's first four years, revenues doubled to $9 million, and the company began a massive expansion into every continent.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 a man on the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computing standards of the day, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, simultaneously buying the consulting division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus concentrating entirely on consulting and high value-added services.
IBM has made great strides in the last three years with their Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the commercial space, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen monitor the entire sales cycle.
The IBM tradition is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, the first country to be located in both central and eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European headquarters are located in Prague, where a world-class speech recognition research team is also located.
Richter's wife says of her cheating husband:
Ivet, keep the fool, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rykhthardzhova, 53, said it was over!
After her husband, Josef Richterz (53), became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoschova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she doesn't want to wait any longer, and has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", explained Rihtarjova.
When Darina Rihtarzhova gave Bartošova a summer home, she probably had no idea what was going to happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave Rzhityan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After some time, Darina gave up, pretending to have come to terms with her husband's affair; and now she had finally said good-bye to him.
Richards doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if one day Rikhtarj and Bartošov break up, his wife won't welcome him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out".
"However, he will not end his days as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom I have something to do", said Rikhtarzhoyeva, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has not been upset by his wife's rejection.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that".
"My wife has decided to keep the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision".
"Our union is still functioning; I am responsible for the repair, the garden, the house and the shopping".
"Darina and I are communicating perfectly well, except that we no longer share a bed", Richthorge told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rikhtarjova finds a new love, he won't stand in her way.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she sleeps with, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivet and I'm fully responsible", Joseph concluded.
Bad Habits of Women - Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines describing some of the female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Does your other half complain that you shop all the time?
Do you have to buy at least one item every week?
Do you like shopping at big sales?
If so, your shopping is a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping.
Still, how many of you would refuse to go to a clothing store to find the perfect fit and try it on (preferably in different colors) in a fitting outfit?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
The eternal discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
You did?
Then you're in the category of women obsessed with their looks.
Not that you have to stop watching yourself, but many men are literally allergic to their partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequently such complaints are made, the more irritating they are to women.
Order and cleanliness are the most important.
It's like a never-ending story.
Wash the windows, vacuum the floor, dust off the floor, clean the bathroom at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for treading on a clean pavement in dirty shoes; your children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the living room window that were so difficult to clean?
If you suffer from this "deviance", try to recognize that going to extremes is not good; and that your home should not be a place of order and cleanliness.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationships and your family.
The urge to command
"Throw the underwear in the basket".
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not be on the floor".
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course you mean well, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to be in charge so often...
The gossip .
Some women like to gossip, abuse, and plot against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, we all may be involved in gossip.
Let's be honest, that's the nature of women, apparently.
But there are more serious gossipers, women who gossip and slander others, and they, especially in the female workforce, are a great danger to their surroundings.
Jagr and Vorocek's passes helped Philadelphia win.
During Monday's NHL game, two productive passes from hockey forward Jaromír Jagr helped Philadelphia win 5-3 on Carolina ice, and he again became the most productive Czech player of the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another pass and was declared the best player of the match.
Two of the game's resulting passes were also owned by Jagr's teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he predicted a great evening for the Gira.
"I told him before the game that he would score a hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you feel things like that", explained Yager, after whose actions Girou scored the goal at the first opportunity given by the Flyers.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech trace".
The closing Hurricane's Weaver took possession of the puck and passed it to Max Talbot, who scored between the circles.
With one second left in the first period, home player Patrick Dwyer closed the gap to the lead, but the Flyers took the lead again early in the second half.
Especially Gira.
After a productive pass from Jagr, he scored a third goal; his shot was later converted into a fourth by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr said, praising his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing with a hockey player like him".
"It makes me happy".
"I want to support him".
"All these years in the NHL my teammates have tried to help me, and now it's my turn", Yager added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"The pronger has been doing well in our area".
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed went over to the far end".
"I was aiming for him and I'm glad it worked", Voratchek said of his impressions of the final goal of the match.
The win moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not complete the game against Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an upper-body injury.
With an experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point lead and lost 2:3 after a penalty shootout.
Tomasz Plekanec failed to score during one of their attacks.
More than the points lost, the home coach was upset by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"This is a bad situation".
"We finished with only one experienced player, the rest were young people".
"Whatever it is, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to accept it", said Jacques Martin.
"Substitute for substitute, it was amazing and we couldn't resist".
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone".
"What was our weakness", added defender P.K. Subban.
After thirty attacks, Czech goalie Andžaj Pavelec helped Winnipeg defeat Tampa Bay 5-2.
The Blue Jets, who have broken a five-game losing streak, have been shut out by five different players.
Price dynamics for travel since 1989
Until 1989, only five state-owned tourist agencies were allowed to operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies of the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists went on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balatón).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which resulted in significant restrictions on Czech tourists traveling to Yugoslavia.
A big paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was necessary; otherwise, an individual trip was impossible.
Back then, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but you had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" at the agency.
And that's not all.
A currency permit was required for travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain funds (Western currency) for travel to the West.
Most Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit has been preserved to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While before 1989 holidays to the GDR or Bulgaria were the highlight of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989, we couldn't freely visit the now most popular of Croatia, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the abolition of visa requirements for neighboring Western European countries triggered a huge wave of short-term travel, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough of travelling to the West, everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (cans, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech krona, which after decades our tourists can finally buy Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income were rising, which around 1997 led to another important circumstance.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to arrange regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the late 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed countries in the world except the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of post-revolution travel occurred in 2000 when a huge demand led to the first ever direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been taking Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter, flights from the Czech Republic will be taking them to twelve exotic destinations.
Now, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, happened in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, permanently adding our country to the ranks of the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15 thousand kroner per person for holidays abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The General Assembly must elect a president, the threat of the duck returns.
Czech football has been without a president for nearly five months, and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hášek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place in Nymburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what election rules to follow.
Without it, the voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yintzi Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Pazlík are all eager to lead the Czech football.
Ghasek left his post in June, and as he left, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
However, the Gashek era has again plunged football into a feud between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite apparent on September 16, when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the general assembly had come to the National House in Prague, Smíchov, in vain, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials who had been given powers of attorney.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on delegated powers is impossible.
Disputes over the election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Council has not been much help either, although in its meetings, both regular and special, it is mainly concerned with this issue.
The idea of voting has changed several times, but the core issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we move on to round three and avoid a tie?
"The issue is whether to follow the established norms or to find another model", says one of the vice-presidents of FAČR, Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who has received the most support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to have agreed to a compromise - to consider the winner of the election the candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the overall winner must have at least two-thirds of the votes.
"However, the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of two chambers", Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments, saying it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to the existing norms.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tomasz Paczlik agrees with his opinion, although according to estimates, the election rules, defined by the charter, suit Pelt more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be held as much as possible according to the statute".
"I want to avoid all the representative stupidity as in the previous general meeting", says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a first-time candidate; and in his statements he mainly contradicted Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nymburk; he also hopes that in the future the candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All the emotional heat will be calm after today's expected departure of the national team for the European Championship".
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate", says Jablonec's spokesman, who has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels of the three candidates.
Reichl is more reserved.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous".
"It's not between representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules".
"It could cause another general meeting disruption".
"I hope that common sense will prevail", Reichl said.
There's not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if a football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was supposed to take Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kuchera and Reichl to Podgorica, did not depart Prague this morning due to a technical malfunction, and was looking for an alternative to take part of the executive committee to the venue of the replay match.
In the end, the ministerial meeting that is expected on Wednesday could prove decisive.
Education, Youth and Sports Minister Josef Dobes wants the rivals in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football's creditworthiness; and a planned general assembly of ČSTV with a new directorate of Czech sports after Sazka's financial problems.
Paczlik enters the presidential race because he can't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of football players in Plzeň, Tomáš Pačlik, had seen a strong candidate who met all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) before the extraordinary general meeting, he would not even have applied for the high post.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself".
"But we haven't found such a person yet", Patzlik told ČTK.
Patzlick's motive for entering the fight with Myroslav Pelta and Jindřich Reichl was to try to prevent Pelta, the supposed favorite of the elections, from entering the FAČR administration.
Moreover, Paczlik emphasizes that in the event of victory, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced top manager, not too connected with football life, to take the position.
"I've spoken to a few people who might be of interest".
"It was horrible for me to hear some of them say that they don't even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment".
"I'd like to change that opinion", he said.
Currently, the main disagreement between Pazlik and Pelta is due to the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbro, the president of the regional football association in Plzen. Berbro is a man of controversial reputation, who behind the scenes is known as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the votes of the delegates of the general assembly.
So, Patzlick thinks it's unacceptable that Peltz should be president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward".
"With the support of Berra, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging for football", said Patzlick.
He alludes to the fact that several years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during a phone hacking investigation into a corruption case; Pelta managed to avoid a conviction.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta win would bring to football".
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Pazlik, who now refuses to mention his earlier statement that he would "sell the club Pilsus if Pelta becomes president".
If Patzlick wins on Thursday, he could envision a future collaboration with Pelta.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paczlik supported before the general assembly in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would turn to".
'He is very capable.'
"I can see him leading the team".
"But he can't run the association".
"I don't stick my nose into things I don't know about either", said Patzlick, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judging panel led by Lüdek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Patzlick claims he's risking running the association.
He refers to his experience managing private companies; last summer he managed the team Plzen, which celebrated its first triumph in the league with his help in May.
"I have the power to change the football environment, to support it to change for the better".
"To limit the influence of certain groups of people who tend to exert influence on the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to disgusting situations", said Paczlik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta, Daniel Krzhetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level for more money to be allocated to sports from the lottery collections.
"This is one of the key issues that the new president must address".
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they should clearly state where the money goes", he said.
Paczlik does not consider his association with the Płzyn club a burden, although he claims that the president of FAČR should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal".
"Yet I don't see the point in hypocritically handing over my shares of the Pzlzen club to someone else, since I'm going back there in six months", says Paczlik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that would allow the avoidance of the Electoral Pat
Two days before the general assembly of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules to avoid future disputes over the election rules.
Until the talks in Nimburgo on Thursday, the Yablonets functionary remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the pre-election struggle will be significantly diverted by today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed election in September, Pelta had promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to run at the last moment before the last general assembly, a two-month delay could thus have been useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be famous on Thursday".
"They feel that it is high time that someone headed the association", said the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but has spent many years in Sparta and on the association's executive committee.
This gives him grounds to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at the general meeting in June".
"If different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September", said Pelta.
He referred to the rewriting of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider this my personal mission, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt fails".
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist", Pelta argues.
Besides, he says he's not trying to stand out from the competition.
He has previously stated that he could envision his collaboration with Jindřich Reichl, whom he admires for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Patzlick, who was constantly critical of Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and has had some success".
"However, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by his campaign tactics".
"That's why some of them now doubt his true identity", said Pelta of his rival, who says he is true to the declarations he made in September.
He considers his main weapon to be his knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team should represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"Immediately after that I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole of football", the 40-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as head of football would not lead to staff being laid off.
"I will need to know the instructions of the individual employees". This was his message to Strahov, where the prolonged period between the authorities causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the planned general assembly, he believes that Thursday's delegates will arrive in Nymburk for a reason.
"If the only issue is how to conduct the third round, we can handle that".
"Football needs the trust it can only gain by finally electing its leader", says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career as a functionary.
Reichl promises that under his leadership the FAČR will be active
If at the meeting on Thursday, Jindřich Reichl, the current vice-president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association, according to rumors, will be displeased.
Reichl promises that if he's elected, it'll be a time of hard work.
He wants to change the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; bring more money to football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gashek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football in general".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national teams, professional football and youth football events".
"I don't mean to say that I will do everything myself", Reichle said in an interview with ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute the powers of the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area".
"I'm carefully assigning tasks so that in each of these segments football makes great strides forward".
"It probably won't be popular with a lot of people because it will mean hard work, not just criticizing the work of others", he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement has supposedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"Because I know I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know if there is any sense in it; and that I will not be surrounded by people who are putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move", he explained his doubts.
"However, many people told me that I should not give in, or others would come".
"It's a trust I can't shake", he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all out".
"Processes have been initiated that could produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them", he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to what it was before Gasek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that I don't think Mirek Peltha is very good at".
"He's surrounded by people who would make football so accessible to the elite".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I'm not really a subjective person".
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a select few", Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies the accusation that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
"Despite many people trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia".
"For example, it was time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the struggle in the first league".
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", Reichl said.
While the presidential race has entered the manager of the club Plesz, Tomasz Paczlik, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"Nevertheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes", Reichl said, attributing his success to saving tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiating contracts with television and negotiating the lottery law.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of restoring the creditworthiness of Czech football", he considers another rival, Pazlik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he has done a great job in Plzeň this year".
"If elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gašek started, without any major personnel changes in the committees".
"He would not have twisted the facts to his own advantage", Reichl said of his rival.

Universal fibre optic swimming pools and status swimming pools in Budapest, where travellers can experience Europe's incredible waters - and relax their weary bodies in the Jacuzzi after a city tour or a stroll.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
One thing Iris Meder has not been able to do without during her exploratory journeys for the past year and a half: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubim awaiting her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored art nouveau swimming pools.
She was quick to add every pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the building's construction and history.
Architectural historian Meder has surveyed more than 200 swimming pools - and now has collected impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing), which includes everything from public pools in Munich to historic bath palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Her "journey to the most unusual bathing spots in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries, including Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and visited bathing spots in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia, and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but the water is different.
The only drawback is that swimming enthusiasts have to put up with the blue tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the enticing scent of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so horrible", says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful pools".
When the surface doubles the architecture
The health benefits of splashing in the pool and the fine oils in the sauna are so significant in the baths because, according to Meder, all the senses are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher if the builders take on such a task. "Instead of a floor in a pool, you have a surface of water".
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles, and trampolines.
The illustrated 190-page edition of "The Joy of Bathing" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and makes you want to jump into the water.
The watercollector Meder discovered several outstanding specimens during her research in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (the Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (the Városi Termálfürdö in Jaspern), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest.
Many of the heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, offer a spectacular view of the city, you can see the whole of Zurich from the rooftop pool, or you can see the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton, and the steam engine has a window that lets you see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits the divers at Langenfeld, the aquatic cathedral at Ecksthal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from three open caves, which seem very small against the background of the Etztal Mountains.
The Alhambra in the Swartzwald
The collector of the pools, Meder, did not find the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, and the Arpad Baths in Bekeshchab smell of oil so strongly that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a health resort.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbon in alkaline water, which is almost black from the silt that sticks to your skin as you dive into the pool, a healing experience of a certain kind.
Iris Meeder, however, at a certain point became disillusioned with her search for beautiful bathing places. When she attempted to visit the Czech Baths open-air pool in Lugáčevice, she found that the area was sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902, were closed.
As Meder peered into the magnificent windows of the red, white, and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by the hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in the Schwarzwald - the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction, and you'll find not only neo-Romanesque elements from the period after 1844 but also a Moorish Alhambra-style hall added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of the pool connoisseur Iris Meeder - and not just because she is from the Schwarzwald.
"It's a real achievement to combine so many different architectural styles", says Meder.
Diving into a thermal pool in a palace like this is clearly a secondary activity.
Speculation in agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Thieves is a
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in farm products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has given the task force the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The CEO plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg is
The situation is clear for German citizens: According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of those surveyed are demanding that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade is exacerbating the problems facing the world's poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that gambling on the world commodity exchanges drives up prices - and that the banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The campaign by consumer advocates is directed against Deutsche Bank head Josef Ackermann, although major banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are trading as well.
Originally, the commodity rates were intended as a means of protecting merchants from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism by promising to investigate the allegations and said that no deal was "worth risking Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international task force is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the board of managing directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation in late January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch president Tilo Baudet welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "Betting on rising food prices is a stark example of how recklessly banks are currently acting against the public interest".
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain obligation, according to Bode.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices", said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Akkermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but meanwhile the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his tenure in office.
Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the chairman will not be moving to the supervisory board as planned.
The elimination of the controversial speculation in the food commodities market could improve its image.
He also has little to worry about - the consequences will have to be dealt with by his successor.
One in two would give up investing in commodities.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the campaign.
The study was conducted for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people participated.
No more than eleven percent believe that investments that bet on the price of food are acceptable for Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take concrete steps if they found out that their bank was involved in such trading, according to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits, which ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
Forty-three percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
A 21st century house in Vienna
The pavilion is in a new location
I 'm not going to do this .
An architectural history with ups and downs and a happy ending. The Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was deserted and abandoned.
Now it's reopening as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, and bold that expressed a belief in technical progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix in architecture in 1958 for its lightweight, floating steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World's Fair.
It finally became world famous in 1973 with its legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister, the bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a building for temporary exhibitions, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, transformed and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
However, the building was not technically and spatially suitable for the museum - it had no walls to hang artwork on, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna found a new home.
The house had been vacant since 2001, and it was getting worse and worse.
The pavilion has been renovated by architect Adolph Krishanitz and is called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening - a joyous occasion in every way.
Agnes Husllein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007, contributed to the new beginning.
Huslein-Arko, an art history graduate with a brilliant figure skating career in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, convinced politicians and curators to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and made the decision about how the building would be used.
The new museum was to house the permanent exhibition of the Fritz Vothrube Foundation, a café and a bookstore along with modern art.
Strict controls and limited budget .
Kritzhanitz was the ideal candidate for the project.
He was famous, of course, for restoring and expanding the Vienna Secession by Josef Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him "an exceptionally important place" where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the challenges facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last renovation were much more serious.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, glass-fibre reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel crossbars of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, the recessed light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still the elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color to protect against corrosion.
The movie theater hall is the same as it was before.
All of this is under strict museum management and on a tight budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would be approved by the museum board", says Krishnitz, pointing to the uneven pavement in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite its limitations, challenges and transformations.
Chrisanthies recently noted that the Brussels pavilion was a rough one - a typical "drop in the city" story.
Such architecture is "always out of place" and yet wants to "stimulate real awareness".
The 21st Century House is in the right place, as a stroke of luck has occurred in the planning of the city, with the completely reconstructed "main station quarter" of offices and residential properties growing around the Swiss Garden.
The 21st-century house may be supplemented by a second building by Chrisanitz - collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired Berlin's temporary exhibition hall and is reportedly in talks with the city to locate it next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million euro winter crisis relief package
Deutsche Bahn has released a crisis plan to avoid train cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be in the millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, Bild reports that some 300 million euros are planned for the company's investments until 2015.
The investment is intended to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of owned and hired employees involved in clearing snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before the start of the work and 90 percent of the necessary blasting in four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grübe, the head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties with passenger services, as it was short of reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railroad Service.
There were also some delays with ICE service.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axles of ICE trains much more frequently over the years after one of the ICE trains had a broken axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a multi-million pound fine in the US
Further trouble followed the turmoil surrounding Joseph Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank was facing a fine in the United States of many millions of pounds sterling.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble at home, the industrial giant's past in the US now has it in its sights. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
The problem was the mortgage bond sale.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the financial market regulator, is accusing a number of the largest banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
Bond prices plummeted during the financial crisis and pulled down credit unions.
"We are pleased that this matter has been resolved without the parties having to go to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank of New York.
The bank did not admit any wrongdoing in the agreement.
The same goes for Citigroup, which has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the swift response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), is responsible for the credit unions of the United States and intervenes in bankruptcy proceedings to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting for damages that run into the billions.
It's the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also took notice of other major banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The so-called "questionable mortgage bonds" are securities backed by a pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed by domestic loans.
It was the fate of a number of financial firms when the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers was ordered to live a long life in September 2008 on the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, U.S. banks are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a number of lawsuits, demanding compensation or punishment for fraud.
Behind the biggest wave of claims is the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
It accuses 18 major international banks of having purchased from the American lending institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collateral agreements worth approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also faces a threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous deals worth $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for "substantial losses", but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett is investing $10 billion in IBM.
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought more than ten billion dollars worth of stock.
Warren Buffett, the largest investor in America, has always said that he doesn't invest in computer and IT companies because it's hard to predict their long-term future.
But IBM's annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Buffett said he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for other companies' IT departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was seen as a chivalric gesture.
IBM, the veteran IT industry, has now been given the title "sir IBM".
In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said that he had bought IBM shares for $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management that managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job", Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a significant period of time, IBM has been focused on high-yield IT services such as data centers.
The pioneer of the computer industry, now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
Up until now, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He said he only invested in companies he understood the business of.
And he's invested in, for example, rail freight, in the production of lubricants, and in engineering.
His Berkshire Hathaway holding company owns stakes in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the world's most valuable companies on it with skillful investments.
His lifestyle, however, remained modest,
Making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost flawless money-making instinct earned him the nickname "The Oracle of Omaha".
IBM's stock price rose one percent before the markets opened following Buffett's investment announcement.
The blue giant, as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The danger is imminent .
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One of the papers is talking about a "bloody ideology" that is now rising to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were the reaction to this news in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, the news has revived long-forgotten fears, such right-wing attacks on Turks have not happened since the arson attacks in Mölne in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
Never in doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been uncovered now has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"Renewal of bloody ideology?" was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret intelligence officer and expresses concern that the German authorities may be dragged into the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, commemorating victims of racial hatred with a silent picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labor agreement at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
"A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German Hürriyet also drew a parallel.
"Starting to stink" is the title of Ahmet Kulhji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The police's conduct and the subsequent successful raid were sharply criticized on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought of following up on suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles earlier.
Some authors have gone so far as to say, "If they continue to act in this way, the migrants will have no choice but to take up arms in self-defense".
"It's the best defense".
"Peace in Germany is very much dependent on the discovery of the entire network and the legality of the punishment", writes "Selen".
The crimes in Möllne and Zoelingen in the 1990s were an example of how peace in Germany was under threat.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen has deeply impressed the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks who live here that danger is looming, and to the Germans that distrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Don 't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time was mainly condemning the failures of the German police after the attacks.
He sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president after the arson in Zolingen, but the participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne was accepted by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he's measuring a man's worth by the taxes he pays.
The recent coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
It clearly shows what needs to be done now beyond efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
The Banking Scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe's risk-taking banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has struggled with one crisis after another ever since.
Now it's up to the German to get him back on track.
Alex Weber probably had no idea he was going to be cast in this.
In July, after his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would take the equally spectacular job of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS, in 2013; an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly enthusiastic, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength and making a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to change for the better".
"I look forward to working with Caspar Philliger and Oswald Grubel".
But by September, it was clear that things would be different.
A UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, was forced to resign.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And as the bank said Tuesday, he'll be taking over as chairman in May, not 2013.
This is not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He's an economics professor and central bank expert, not a traditional banker, and he's certainly going to need some time to adjust.
He was suddenly in charge of the strategy of a bank that had long since proven itself to be "the biggest banking scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently it managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other hand, it's been in scandal for years.
It seems the proud Swiss bank is sparing nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
UBS had a great reputation before 2007.
The bank combined the image of a stealthy and steady yet agile asset manager with the ambition and drive to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed $1.6 billion, and thus had more money under management from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And as an investment banker, he's one of the biggest banks in the world.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always presented UBS as a model of a good bank to my students".
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask how could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
It wasn't until 2007 that it became clear that something was very wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, executive director Peter Wufley - who was considered a brilliant intellectual and equally brilliant banker - unexpectedly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment arm of the bank tried to play the sub-standard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to deal with the crisis.
The bank did manage to find investors - but investors that many bankers would have politely declined to serve until recently - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so obscure that it was not even named.
That was only the first strike.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel - the second highest paid chairman of the board in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.
In October 2008, disaster struck, and due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was facing the threat of collapse, and the government had to bail it out.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an undisclosed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become co-owners of the bank.
The whole country was shocked to learn the dramatic consequences of a small country being a giant bank.
After all, UBS's 2007 balance sheet total was five times as large as all of Switzerland's production (see chart).
"We will not be able to save UBS a second time", says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was willing to hand over the details of wealthy clients who may have been helped by the bank to evade taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of unjustified business income reimbursement plus penalties.
UBS, therefore, more or less admitted that it was a tool of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS lost what had always been its advantage in the fight for wealthy clients, the veil of secrecy.
After that scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not the same.
The CEO and the chairman of the board of directors then resigned, and
The money of the customers has begun to run out.
In a few months, the bank lost credibility in both of its main areas of activity - in investing due to unsuccessful speculation and in asset management as a result of aiding and encouraging tax evasion.
And then, just as things were calming down and it seemed like UBS had managed to turn things around, there was this disaster with the scam trader, a single trader who had taken out 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
One thing's clear: Risk management in the investment department isn't working yet.
"The Adobi incident clearly showed that risk controls have not changed enough", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of one of Germany's largest banks is also in no doubt: "The problem with UBS is that it has no risk control tool".
It is prudence that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world's greatest assets - not a risk, but a safety for money, whether the world has fallen apart beyond the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still resembles a decent Swiss private bank, only slightly larger.
The layout is a classic in itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on the Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main train station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rents for the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli, one can find jewelry firms like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been housed here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace and elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The heavy door leads to the lobby of the UBS.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas, and beside the bank's emblem is a large "Safe" sign.
UBS knows what its customers want, reliability.
But both of the biggest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss notion of banking - or, as the head of one of the smaller Swiss banks believes, betrayed it.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he's also in partnership with the two largest banks.
He thinks UBS has become too big - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
He thinks the Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if anything, they have long since adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs".
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, bringing it its first big profits - and then its bankruptcy. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the sub-prime asset jungle as the largest Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people launched the largest rescue operation in the country's history", writes Lukas Hassig in his book UBS Crash.
The politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How did this happen?
If you ask Swiss banks, they'll tell you that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
It was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other: one was a wealthy but highly ranked bank, specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not as wealthy but much more internationalized.
The international investment bankers suddenly had access to large amounts of money that they could use to spin the almighty wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wulffly, UBS Group Chief Executive Officer from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolffley and Ospell were the dream team", says Hans Geiger, a bank analyst.
"Wolfley, a brilliant intellectual, modest and deeply understood in models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, who has come all the way from an intern in a bank".
But Ospel eventually came to rely on Wolffley.
Woolfe may have made a critical error. "He decided that his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is tragic".
Maybe this is tragic.
Pride comes before defeat.
UBS employees remember the board meetings where Woolfe always repeated the same slogan - "Shut up Goldman Sachs".
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was the head of the "tournament table" where the successes of the banks were entered.
UBS wanted to be at the top of that chart.
He was able to make some of it.
UBS was the biggest player in the currency and government securities trade.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness, that UBS was far behind the largest banks in terms of what is called "permanent income" in banking terminology.
UBS had a failure in its American mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank and its hedge fund invested in substandard U.S. securities.
It evolved into a big mechanism that bundled securities based on American mortgages and sold them on -- and continued to bear the risk.
Even when other banks had long since sought to escape the process, UBS did not stop.
"UBS was buying until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market was already on fire", says Geiger, a banking analyst.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank proved more difficult than they had originally appeared.
The UBS posts became a child's chair, and to this day remain unreliable.
Anyone who heads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He has to come up with a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger, the bank analyst, has already had an idea to abandon investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activity needs to be substantially curtailed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only seen as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Gruebel.
He has shown character in the past and is now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, heading UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernoti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a development concept.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These are questions Axel Weber must be asking himself.
He's only said publicly so far that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Recession fears in Europe are dragging down the US stock market
The looming recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors earlier in the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in its infancy.
The general relief that followed the changes of government in Rome and Athens received no support.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on the lists of sales.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 12.078 with a 0.6 percent drop.
The barometer of the market during the bidding fluctuated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index fell 0.8 percent to 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the DAX fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced output and is adjusting to the end of growth.
Eurostat reported that companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month.
This message has thrown American investors into a state of skepticism. "We are not on an island. We are dependent on them", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was unlikely to shake off a recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only been able to confirm these fears, saying in an interview with CNBC that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do what is needed to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw away a decade-old principle and invested in America's high-tech industry.
His investment of over ten billion dollars in IBM has driven up the stock price of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed nearly flat at $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now owns 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway dropped 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much more than the market.
The bank converted almost all of its remaining stake in China Construction Bank into cash, raising $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to support its capital ratio with net sales profits to comply with stricter standards.
Airplane manufacturer Boeing has won by cutting losses at Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose by 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 777 long-haul aircraft worth $18 billion.
Including the option to buy 20 more planes, the total is actually $26 billion.
About 710 million shares have changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
719 companies rose, 2,281 fell, and 79 remained flat.
630 companies finished higher, 1913 lower, and 82 stood the same on the Nasdaq at 1.38 billion shares.
The smart crows fill the cities
The gray squirrel is considered a problem bird in many places, and experts now say that these highly intelligent birds will never be driven out of cities.
Crowes have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the number of residents complaining about dirt and noise is growing in many communities.
The solution to the bird problem, however, is far from over.
At the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Lehr, experts argued that crow crowding was no longer possible.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Finding alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of highly protected wild boars, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, expanding construction, and cutting of traditional nesting trees have made life difficult for the birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Yever, Dipholtz, Achim near Bremen and Lera there are large colonies, numbering more than 600 parent pairs.
The controversial project to shoot crows in the Lera caused unflattering headlines in 2005.
Critics described the trapping and beating of the birds with sticks as particularly cruel.
"Relatively moving and scaring is not going to do any good", said architect and landscape designer Werner Klewer of Leer.
The knocking down of nests by a stream of water or the cutting down of trees often has unwanted consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Keiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are dispersing, and the larger colonies are dividing and spreading to other areas".
Scare tactics are only possible in exceptional circumstances near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them.
"The problem of urban areas will not be solved if they are cut off from the surrounding areas", says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kellner.
A combination of scaring birds away from protected residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be the solution.
"Information booths instead of petrol pumps" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uto Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident to live with this problem".
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Ascherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the life of very intelligent crows is given on information stands.
The project is already attracting tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion on complaints about the noise made by birds: "The noise conveys a lot of information.
The intelligence and cunning of these birds have become legendary, and the grizzly often not only use tools to capture prey, but also make their own.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the intelligence of birds on four scales.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to knock on the board to get a moth larva.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone needed to bring down the board.
In another experiment, the smartest monkeys had to solve a more difficult problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket of moth larvae inside a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used the hooks to hook the bucket to the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four guys got it on their first try.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to the Euro 2012
The Bosnian and Turkish hopes for a last-minute victory were not long in coming.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland finished last in the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1), making it their fifth Euro appearance after 0-0 in the first leg.
The Czechs had a 1-0 (0:0) lead in the second round of the playoffs against the Montenegrin outsider after a clean win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily achieved a score of 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (fourth minute), Nelder Postinga (second, seventh and eighth) and Miguel Veloz (eighth) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga player Zvezdan Misimovic and captain Emir Spakić reduced the gap by two points thanks to a penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.

Yiracek scores for the Czech Republic .
Then the spotlight turned to Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding .
Following an attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking, and showed him a yellow card.
Starck also awarded a dubious penalty for a hand after Fabio Kuentran's foul - Misimovich executed it.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champions have added four more goals.
Pyotr Yiracek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are heading to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
The team also had a good run with coach Michael Bieleck and Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nürnberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech in the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented a potential autogoal by Tomáš Sivok.
Montenegro had their best chances when the Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovich duo were on the field.
Damianovich in the 40th minute made a shot from the edge of the penalty area and scored a goal for Chech.
After the break, the stinger saved the already battered world-class Czech goalkeeper after the FC Seoul forward left the field on the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked footballing fortune in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 3-0 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play any better than the 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is little doubt that coach Gus Hiddink will now be leaving the team, who finished third in 2002, in the final of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks got off to a near perfect start in front of 31,000 fans at Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long-range shot hit the net in the seventh minute, and forward Kazim Kazim was unable to hit the ball back into the net.
Croatia woke up and took more control of the game.
After the break, the Croatians continued their game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniël Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Ainträcht, Frankfurt) were on the field along with Mario Mandzukic from the Wolfsburg team, who gave way to Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin were celebrating their first appearance at the Euro since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - which already looked confident after winning 4-0 in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal from Steven Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the guest team equalized the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but it was not until the 23rd minute that Robbie Keen of Los Angeles made his first clean goal kick.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing goalkeeper Paul Londak's defense, Ward got in the right spot and, by passing the ball over the line, changed the score to 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday it would invest about $2 billion (around 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people", said Bill McDermott, one of SAP's chief executives, in a statement at the Consumer Expo in Beijing.
The staff of 2,500 is to grow to 4,500.
The world's leading industrial software company plans to double its number of offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this booming country, there are about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
China's growth is an important component of the 2015 strategy of this Dax-listed company.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.

The software business, with 55,000 employees worldwide, is looking better than ever.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
"We now want to change the scale of our operations", McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by building on the informatization in China".
Mass Murder - The Human Dimension
Peter Englund's tense and very good new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: A Personal History of World War I", begins with a long list of characters that makes the heart race.
Here's a tip for how to read further: Carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund narrates, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, like one of these men and women, you stumble and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's writing now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "a work on anti-history".
It contains few famous names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are few ambassadors, cunning journalists, or discussions of tactics and military equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but "a book about what it was like". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and states of mind".
The book "Beauty and Sorrow" weaves together the experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women from both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanist scientists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and civil servants.
Some of these people are gonna be heroes.
Some will be captured, lose an arm or a leg, go mad or die.
Their lives are flickering here like church candles, new ones being added to many others, and some being extinguished in the meantime.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of history books.
It's also a correction to the notion that World War I was just a heavy trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are being swarmed by beehives; one of them is celebrating Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the flying saucer.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War is sweeping over these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless gunpowder.
When you hear a cannon shot in the distance and you're a woman at home with your children, will you stay put or will you run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we're fighting this war.
"The lack of facts", notes Mr. Englund, "is filled with guesswork, conjecture, hope, fear, obsession, conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the fortunes of such people as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters and other published material.
The stories of their lives can be frightening or exciting, but they are supremely alive thanks to the minute moments and the riveting detail Mr. Englund has collected.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to cope with it.
He tells the story of a German schoolgirl, and says, "Erzse, everywhere Erzse".
"Fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons" and so on and so on.
He keeps talking about the ersatz food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice, boiled in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skins; shoes pressed with wood".
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American, feeling a strong urge for cruelty, said of war: "You feel that, after all, that's what men were made for, not to sit in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, an evening paper or a best-seller, and claim that this show is civilization and that your straw-jacketed shirt is not a barbarian".
The British soldier, on the other hand, sees that he will most likely die and no one will notice or feel sorry for him.
"When one is resigned to the idea of self-sacrifice, one would like to think that it would be in public", he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's like "a condemned man being hanged in secret".
Other remarks concern the old Europe that is falling apart and the new kinds of fear.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition", writes Mr. Englund, "a factory war".
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the new century: a beautifully articulate and ideologically committed mass murderer in a well-sewn suit who stages a massacre from behind a desk".
People act in unpredictable ways: there are as many vile acts as there are heroic ones.
Mr. Englund told me about soldiers who tried to get venereal disease from prostitutes to avoid the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in honorifics, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting into the hospital", he writes.
"The desperate rubbed it in the eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness".
Translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible, but unfussy, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war "has unleashed forces beyond all control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, like Paul Fassel's The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich-Marie Remarque's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unconventional pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can think of in nonfiction.
I'm not going to tell it.
But it's like he reached out of a book and pulled up a character list, and he took it out of your hand and lit it with a match.
After the previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid.
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some in protective helmets.
The nighttime hours of Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park was supposed to be the least crowded at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, the rest were first told they were going to the training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the action, his presence underscoring the importance the Police Department placed on the operation.
There was no question of a repeat of the episodes of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which was against the department's rules and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters.
The authorities were preparing, watching the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randels Island with a focus on Zuccotti.
Authorities have increased what they call riot training - counterterrorism measures that involve the rapid deployment of large numbers of police - in the Lower Manhattan area.
The last training was Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at "the last minute", said a source familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "training".
"The few cops I know who were called on this case weren't told they were being sent to Zookeeper Park", said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zuccotti Park were the highest-ranking people in the department".
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clear the park, but backed off in front of hundreds of protesters who rushed in ahead of schedule after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police departments, including forces from the precincts - the police teams that are usually used to control the criminal precincts.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people, almost like at work, come and go from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. the best time to attack.
"It was the right thing to do when there are the least people in the park", he said.
Emergency vehicles with lights and loudspeakers have been assembled on Pike Slope and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving on.
The searchlights and pre-recorded announcements emanating from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue vests, many of the protesters simply packed their things and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to gather their belongings.
Other police teams, according to eyewitnesses, were gathering around the perimeter to go inside in case the park needed to make arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police act and that the police treated them in a rude manner.
Mr. Brown said that the cameras on Church Street, along the west boundary of the park, could have been taking the picture.
As police moved west through the pile of protesters' personal belongings, including handbags, plastic carpeting and polyethylene bags full of clothing, Sanitation Department teams followed her, collecting what was thrown away.
Some of the protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, and photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen, in the center of the park.
Some of them put up barricades, and the police came in, arresting them methodically.
About 10 people in the center of the camp chained themselves together by the hands.
And two men chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue workers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleanup operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said that approximately 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "violation of public order and resisting arrest", he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department head and the senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's investigative police, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "did not direct the operation", Mr. Brown said.
A second group of officers was standing by along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case we needed to go inside.
The fences were set up on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, observers saw police extend the perimeter even further beyond the Zookeeper's Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, push the crowd even further out.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the night's most serious events occurred just south of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, blew air out of the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The school service union is suing the city for layoffs .
The union, which represents hundreds of school-service staff who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the firings were unnecessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students attend.
A lawsuit is probably the last resort available to the 37th District Council union trying to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent-coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's lowest-paid workers, lost their jobs on October 7 as a result of what union leaders called a political backlash over their refusal to give the city access to health funds run by labor groups to close a budget gap last spring.
City officials have flatly denied the charge.
At a City Council hearing last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members countered by telling him that there was no provision in the budget for the school support staff to be fired.
Representatives of the 37th District Council said they had filed a notice of claims, notifying the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against it; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will name Mr. Walcott and the city's education department as defendants and list eight temporary-said employees as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Hispanic women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not seen the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union focused on a number of school layoffs in the city's poorest neighborhoods to support its claims of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support workers lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at the free middle school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "These are not neighborhoods of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget shortfalls".
P.S. The 36th District's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates supplemental funding for every poor student who enters the school.
The union also alleges that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of the parent coordinators.
The word "transfer" was used in the notice, although "transfer" is more commonly used when a teacher is moved from the school's payroll to a list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent-coordinators were fired", the lawsuit states, "and not just transferred".
Mission accomplished, Congress ready to settle Libya.
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something having to do with the Libyan uprising.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, for the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the American intervention to be over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is set to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (D-Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (R-A) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Conn.) that would praise the Libyans for their successful uprising and the American troops for their "courage".
"The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It's a testament to their democratic aspirations from both parties".
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion of Libya has ever been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of both parties and never made it to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also failed to support a proposal that would have cut funding for the American operation in Libya.
It has left the American mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - where Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry that it actually kicks the soil out from under its feet.
Then events overtook the Congress ' indecision .
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate can be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "admires the Libyan people for their incredible courage and extraordinary steadfastness in the pursuit of freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measures gain the full support of the Council on Foreign Relations or split lawmakers like June's bill?
The latter version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader on the committee.
A spokesman for Luger said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for nearly every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on a budget or anything else to be put to a vote by this year's full Congress.
Other lawmakers have failed to get their amendments through the floor, but it's not because they haven't tried.
The Goodlat amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments covering a wide range of issues that were introduced in this session.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House and the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House of Representatives alone and a few more on "control of federal spending".
Some of them are identical, but they give their authors -- mostly newly elected Republicans who want to embellish their resumes -- a chance to brag about having "picked up" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required that both the House and Senate vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office for members of Congress, and House member Jose Serrano (D-NY) wants to remove the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for years, as has the one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be overturned if two-thirds of the states object.
As eager as members of Congress are to propose amendments, they are not moving any faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th Congress, they introduced 66.
This pace pales in comparison to the early 1990's, when members of Congress regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the Library of Congress.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced in Congress in 1789.
"Defeated, but not defeated", says Giffords in her first television interview since the assassination attempt
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the back at a public event in Tucson, Arizona, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on the Federal Channel on Monday night, singing the tune of the Broadway show "The Sun Will Return Tomorrow", and said she wanted to recover more than return to Congress.
After appearing on ABC News's "20/20" with Diana Sawyer, Giffords struggled to make sentences and needed help walking.
The program showed her difficult journey of recovery from a bullet wound that shattered her skull and pierced the left side of her brain, going from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the debt ceiling bill.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult".
When asked by Sawyer how she was feeling, Giffords, 41, replied: "Very well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special "20/20" that was shown on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
A special edition has been released on Giffords' recovery from the shooting on January 8th.
The video that Kelly took in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair with physical therapists teaching her how to perform simple actions.
Nod your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word was, "What".
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast", asking for a change in the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: We see the congressman singing along with doctors to "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Lauper and "Freefall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day in the office, said she doesn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords' newspaper article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed that day.
Suspected assailant Jerd Lee Lafner is being held in a Missouri prison and is undergoing compulsory treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died", said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's heavy, it's heavy, it's heavy". That's what I said.
One day during her recovery, said Kelly Sawyer, she said, "I'm defeated".
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just getting beat up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than you've ever been.
Troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a celebration on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for New York's homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness and disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines lined up around him.
The audience in tuxedos applauded him standing up.
"The servicemen were looked upon as heroes", said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, who was also attended by then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans", an officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organisers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has developed between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, say military personnel.
The public is acting more and more like they feel sorry for the people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon to leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way some of them can show their support is to treat us like we're miserable".
It's a sensitive subject for military leaders who don't want to seem ungrateful or at odds with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity is quiet and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Kenshun warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two different perspectives.
Some will look on them with admiration, because they have crushed the rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will wonder if "under the mask is a vicious, evil veteran", said Kenshin, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-ranking government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could handle the stress of a responsible job in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kenshin recalls that he told his sons: "When you talk about your ministry, you should expect a negative effect".
The embarrassment that the military is experiencing is partly due to American indifference to war.
Battlefield victories rarely receive praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism in the way it was so commonly used in World War II", says retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mostly focused on the depth of the suffering of the serviceman.
Troops are judged by the number of campaigns they've made, the number of comrades they've lost, or the scale of their losses.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters of the rape ban
This week, a landmark court hearing is set to decide whether to accept 28 men and women's lawsuits against the military for allegedly failing to prevent rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be lined up with the next one.
Private first class Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, claims she was raped by a fellow officer during the night.
It was October 2008, and she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, just north of San Diego, after a dinner with a friend, and she met a male coworker carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could come in her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag", says Lyman.
But the Texas native has cast aside her concerns.
I thought, "No, he's 19".
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I had followed my instinct".
Minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man approached her from behind, knocked her down, and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be anxiously awaiting a court decision at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether to pursue the lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread violence in the military in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Washington, D.C. attorney Susan Burke, initially included 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 over the following months - 25 women and three men - all of whom allege that they were raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow service members and that the military did not properly investigate, prosecute or provide proper justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says she's targeting the top ranks of the army because that's where the problem begins.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence?
Burke also says that about 400 other victims have contacted her since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of putting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she'll open up more cases if she needs to to keep the pressure up.
A defense team from the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to close the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy - essentially one that prevents former or current soldiers from suing the military for damages suffered in the military.
Under the doctrine, called the Feres Doctrine in the 1950 Supreme Court decision, the federal government is not liable for damage caused by persons on military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risks inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs", the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, things have changed.
Although women are still officially barred from combat, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women's teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in dealing with local women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars -- two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to modernize, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her fight; three others are being prepared in addition to her suit.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against four of the largest military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
A separate nonprofit, the Vietnam Veterans of America, is preparing a lawsuit against the military, which centers on diagnoses of "personality change" that make it a commonplace to subject women to violence to remove them from service, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Army Activists.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Affairs Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in reviewing pension claims from people who claim to have been sexually assaulted while in the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a range of measures were introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Department of Defense's Office of Sexual Violence Prevention and Control, there were 3,158 reported attempted rapes.
But as we know, attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon's own estimate is that this figure is approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 attacks that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: 20 percent of known cases went to court in 2010 - twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case are calling the attacks on them the first in a series of injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to give details of the rape separately 11 times to a handful of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a rape kit, and the assailant's blood - from the cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat in front of a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming".
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I came out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial for him. It was a trial for me.'"
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that rendered her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was terminated with an unfavorable termination, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman and her class will prevail is a difficult question, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he says: "In my opinion, they are able to move forward".
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since its inception.
I've been a critic of the Ferese Doctrine my whole life.
The military has been lagging behind for decades because it lacks the incentives and the deterrents that come with responsibility.
He adds: "The odds are stacked against them . . . but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will round up hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform", she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who was putting his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to committing the mass murder in Norway in July that killed 77 people, appeared in his first public court hearing.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was far from alone in the network: he spent a lot of time preparing for the attack at his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy, you just need to go on Facebook.
"We found it was very easy to get to them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyberpopulism by the UK-based DEMOS research centre.
Facebook's personal data pool is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to target the right demographic with scientific accuracy - something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pushed ads to them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ads invited the user to take a survey that asked questions about their level of education, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Using Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 members of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even leaving their offices.
"This is a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so striking: the online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are unhappy with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online and offline activities are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who hide behind a screen".
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research institutes, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends that are expressed in 'likes' and wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts per day, Facebook's "super-recent news" has been driving a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site's name in the headline by 800% in the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people that you can't reach on the street with a notebook.
"In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would have been very difficult to identify them".
"You'd have to join the party, and they'd never accept you", says Bartlett.
"Facebook is excluding all of this - you're going directly to them".
Others say that the site could be used to identify and research social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about them.
Moreno suggests that peers of students, such as their dorm room mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates his drunk status too often.
"You can't solve a problem without identifying it", Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told The Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not have been detected".
Facebook also constantly extracts all kinds of data about its users.
The site's data processing team has processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, midterm voter turnout in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using information only they have access to - champions of cyberfreedom have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not -- in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for conducting offline research, online data is open to the public.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profile", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a study he conducted in 2006 using publicly available student Facebook pages.
"As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends".
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the subject of the study is completely honest.
There's no way to know on Facebook how much of a user's profile and page is real.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", says Selvin.
That's why, despite his years of technological research, Selvin thinks that a notebook and a pen are still the best research tools you can use.
"There's no substitute for going out into the real world and interacting with real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social, and a lot of social still happens offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik will appear in court for the first time in public
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to orchestrating the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway", he said to the 500 people present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you got your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I admit to the deed, but I do not admit the guilt".
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik face to face, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman", a survivor of Utøya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally I was a little relieved after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik maintained his composure and professionalism throughout the hearing, and looked the journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically lessen the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now feeling.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't", said a relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if it were like this".
Seven lessons from the lost Steve Jobs interview that's playing in theaters this week.
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the tech genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest revelation in the newly rediscovered interview that was recalled in anticipation of previews in major markets this week is how much this creative genius understood about business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and a self-described hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and modernizationist who believed that many business executives suffered from "the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea is separated from a great product by a tremendous amount of skilled labor".
Back in 1995, Bob Kringle was creating the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs in a unique long conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was fired from Apple, and he was already working full-time at his new computer company, NeXT, in anticipation of the mass adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Kringle's interview was used in Nerds, he says the original interview was lost in transit.
It wasn't until after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, is the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is being released at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of in-depth interviews, Jobs seems unusually ready to lay out his technology philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly resourceful.
There are four different moments during the interview where there are long intervals between questions and answers -- 10-15 second reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems to be annoyed by Kringle's questions, forcing him to move quickly to questions or events of greater importance.
In this pre-Pixar, iPod, and iPhone era, "Lost Interview", there's something eerily prophetic as Jobs assesses what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about posthumous appraisals of Jobs' work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here, an anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of the seven most important conclusions of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All my life in business, I've been asked, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's just the way it's done.'
Nobody knows why they do what they do, nobody thinks about business very deeply.
Here's what I found out.
Jobs goes on to detail his attempts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Distracted by the way expense tracking often started with "standard expenses" that were taken from the ceiling and then scaled up with "scrutiny", he created an automated structure that ensured they could track business expenses down to the last detail.
About the Pope joke:
Jobs details the "blue box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
The device has been written about a lot before, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, ordering a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We circled the globe half a dozen times, and you yelled into the pay phone, and a minute later it was in the next pay phone", Jobs says with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could engineer something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both knew little, but we could engineer a little thing that could control a big thing, and that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple could have ever come into existence without it.
Jobs goes on to detail one famous stunt that he and Wozniak practically pulled off, calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, trying their best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, these two broke out laughing just before the Pope himself was taken up to answer the phone.
On being in love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's cold-called-out-of-the-box-of-the-world):
At age 12, while hunting for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a profound effect on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's Palo Alto research labs, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a little monitor with an e-ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and hang around that machine and write programs for it.
On the improvised innovation:
In several of the interviews, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he was off to sell a handful of circuit boards, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working on a 30-day loan, he had to think about both assembling and delivering the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalled the difficulties he faced while developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I went out and found a designer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could put together for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
The big companies that are wasting energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs had foreseen that many of the industry's leaders would misjudge the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more success.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who end up in the leadership of companies, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The genius of the product that led to this monopoly position is being pushed out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the skill required.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire IT industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be the Microsoft of the '90s...
They got a defeat out of a win.
On innovation as an art form:
"The great idea is separated from the great product by a great amount of hard work... when you promote a great idea, it changes and grows".
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are trade-offs you have to make -- some things you can't make electrons or glass or robots or factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 ideas in your head, these concepts, and link them all together...
It's ultimately about taste -- it's about trying to express yourself in the best way that humans have ever done, and then later -- trying to bring that into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best information technology experts in the world.
If it wasn't for information technology, they would be doing amazing things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with health care opponents while the court deals with the case.
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious question of whether it would hear President Obama's health care law rejection, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were honored at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will be challenging the case before the high court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine justices met to discuss the petition.
One of the items on the agenda was a petition supported by 26 states challenging the sweeping health care overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that has united conservative activists across the nation.
The judges have agreed to hear the case; in fact, a 5 1/2 hour roundtable debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a disruption in the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the verdict is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the deputy attorney general during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual luncheon of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently upholds conservative legal principles.
The other firm that sponsored the lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing on the case.
Among those in attendance was Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader and a known opponent of the health care bill.
The guests of honor at the dinner?
It's not new, two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not against ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they had, they would have been likely to fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charity events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or be mentioned in the program of such an event".
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal to ethics activists in government.
"This stunning disregard for ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the claims of some judges that the court remains committed to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of the General Court.
"Judges were drinking and dining at an official fund-raising event with lawyers whose cases are now in court".
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say they are quite willing to conflate court cases with groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is Justice Helena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas, who is the ethical issue.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges against the law were filed at the trial level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan be removed from the case because she was too involved in the defense of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan has shown no sign of doing so.
Boeing receives record $18 billion in aircraft orders
Emirates Airlines is ordering 50 Boeing 777 wide-body airliners and may order 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company is getting an order for 50 of its products.
But it's a big deal when that company is the Boeing Co., and the list price for all 50 of those planes is 18 billion dollars.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders for planes.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest order in dollar terms for a commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine airliners.
An incredible order has come in from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will bring the total price tag to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Airshow 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price tag for the six planes will be over a billion dollars.
"This is really very good for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high".
Many of the Middle East's airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have money to pay for the planes, but the fuel price hike, which usually hurts the airlines because it's one of their biggest expenses, is not so devastating because the country is making money off of high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel orders for planes when prices rise, Diora said.
"They have natural defenses", he said.
Emirates' order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-body market and helps to prevent rival Airbus SAS from attempting to take over its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory at the airshow came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the world's largest A350, which competes with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to increase the axial load after customers demanded increased payload and flight range.
Boeing Co's stock is up 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico apparently lost the election in Michoacán.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have failed to make a bid for governor of Michoacan during a bitter statewide election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results show that the leading candidate for the governorship of the western state is Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country", said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the elections.... They grabbed the ballot boxes, put up obstacles ... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She's preparing to return, and winning Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly overtaken Calderon, who was leading the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or NAP, headed by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now holds the governor's seat, came in third - a major defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital of Morella, denied any links to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It's the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues to this day.
The PND mayor was assassinated a week before the election when he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and several candidates withdrew from the local race out of fear.
For the PRI, however, as awful as the election in Michoacan may have looked, victory will give the party a moving momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very inspiring in the run-up to next year".
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis, to avoid a long-term downturn that would halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Raj Najat, managing director of the ADB's Manila office, said the two fastest growing large economies should "do everything they can" to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties "with an open mind", and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"We all have to do with it".
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful", he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable".
"So if China and India can help, we must do it".
The European Monetary Union has been badly undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing has grown alarmingly, and both the Italian and Greek prime ministers have resigned.
Europe's unfolding debt crisis has raised fears that it could again send the global economy into recession, and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Ng predicted that any Asian aid would be delivered through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- like the purchase of bonds from the EU's financial aid fund, the funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provides a huge bargaining chip for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uncertain", he said.
"We have a great challenge and we must maintain a high rate of growth".
"This is not an option, it is a must, because where we will find work for tens of millions of our young men and women".
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they are facing their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to help Europe for India's 1.2 billion people, about 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go to the seaside for holidays, and that won't be perceived well", he said.
Lee Hovell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to make "emergency plans" to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's dire warnings about potential defense spending cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated the atmosphere Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan to the line and the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to cutting $450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more could be inevitable if Congress cannot agree on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration is triggering a 23% overall cut and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a drastic cut, applied so recklessly, would render most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unviable - you cannot buy three-quarters of the ships or buildings - and would seriously damage other modernization attempts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also have to lay off many of our full-time employees, and since the layoffs will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off full-time employees to achieve the goal".
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our military and will seriously damage our readiness".
The cuts will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"While military funding in overseas emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military gains will be severely affected by a serious disruption in core budgets", warned Panetta.
"Contract staff will be cut, which will end with the cancellation of contracts and the supervision contract that supports the troops".
"Staff will be cut, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted".
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of the sequester in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We stand firm against this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement Monday night as they released Panetta's letter.
"This is not an option we can live with, and this is not an option we should impose on ourselves".
"Sequestr is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it cannot be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter or the senators' latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls for the Pentagon to be freed from cuts, we'll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about the potential cuts, even though he came to the Pentagon leadership after years of budgeting in Congress and the White House and realizing that he faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might follow -- troops with shells but no nukes.
"This is a ship without sailors".
"This is a squad without bullets".
"This is a wing of a plane without adequate pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness and inability to fight potential enemies".
"In fact, it encourages the aggression of the"...
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta detailed how the cuts "create significant operational risks: slow down our response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed tests, and some that are only in the early planning stages.
This list includes the single-engine F35 fighter jet, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone warship, and a new land combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps need to replace the Hummer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its proponents say it's a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Liar
A quick glance at recent headlines shows how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy disputing sexual harassment allegations against several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania was charged with perjury for allegedly concealing the fact that a retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on the mic, telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by denying his antics, which was quickly refuted by compelling evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance fraud, involving the concealment of extramarital affairs.
And again, no one living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton being caught lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating on exams at school and college are common.
There were times when teachers gave students answers to tests so that they could have a good sense of their own performance.
The teachers who are supposed to teach the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many lies are we exposed to?
Research shows that you can be lied to from 10 to 200 times in a single day.
Now it's assumed that a significant part of that is a lie to save lives.
Another study found that strangers lied to each other three times within 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting a lie or exposing a lie is a skill everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, like a charade, where you have to say, "I got you!" lie detection is a serious area of knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities, engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look people in the eye.
They don't always stutter, blush, or fuss.
This does not mean that liars are difficult to spot or to expose.
A skilled lie detector can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, facial expressions, the structure of questions, and time characteristics.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries in the vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lying, and it's clear that lie detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps you navigate in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone else's feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are the most outrageous).
We also know that if you're perceived as a cheat, others will feel less guilty about cheating you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
It's called "determining the initial state".
This helps provide a starting point for evaluating the change further.
Watch your subject's posture, laughter, vocal characteristics.
You'd do well to know if a person is tapping their feet constantly in a normal state, then you wouldn't be making unfair accusations when you see foot tapping in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
The deceivers can fixate on their upper body when they try to recall their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or show "after-interview relief" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change when all the difficult questions are behind us.
Investigators often fake the end of an interview to just look at it as relief after the interview.
Now, pay attention to your subject's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, leading to a nationwide search for her.
People who are craving may also use distance in speech: "I did not have sexual relations with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely perceptible.
Someone may use "qualifying language" when answering a difficult question: "Well ... to be honest ... as far as I know ... as far as I know".
This makes the response more emotional than factual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic tool to detect lies, but the skill of deception detection can be mastered.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not becoming a victim of skilled fraudsters in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline construction plan needs revision after U.S. threat to delay approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approving a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating labor unions but appeasing environmentalists -- the company that is going to build the pipeline says it is willing to reconsider the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will remove a planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska and is confident that the project will still get approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay a federal decision on the project until it had explored new possible routes that do not involve the Nebraska Sand Hills area and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is a real step forward", said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
A new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay the decision until 2013, after next year's election, though authorities have denied that politicians were involved.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the decision a call from the State Department, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It's supposed to move 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do that, he'd have to cross six states.
He's hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor unions who hope to create some 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to speed up the displacement of the Sandhills and Ogallala watersheds, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A recent State Department environmental impact study found the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but an energy industry source said the Department's auditor had ordered a separate review of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One - whether the lobbyist employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another was whether the firm that was hired to conduct the initial research was inappropriate, as it was connected to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle is being sued for allegedly causing a child to have fear nausea.
A New York family claims that disco diva Patty LaBelle began rampaging through the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their infant daughter to the point of making her vomit in terror.
The tirade of "Lady Marmalade" singer frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "an intense fear of strangers", her family says in Manhattan Superior Court.
It happened on November 10th last year, when stage manager Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk came down the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and lowered her daughter to the floor for half a minute.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said yes and went to get her", she said.
LaBelle angrily reprimanded a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door,'" said Rosanna Monk.
I told her, "I don't care what you say or what you think".
She got mad and started using profanity -- the C word and the F word -- in a high pitch...
She had a water bottle, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was having a fit.
"I told this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into a waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she was sick, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
Lawyer and LaBell representatives are not answering calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not disclosed, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it receives to a charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to hold Patty LaBelle accountable for her actions", Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, "especially for a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old in her arms".
Climate change has slowed the economy.
During Mario Lopez's first year in office, Sinaloa's unemployment and illegal labor market increased, foreign funding decreased, and the economy weakened.
2011 is a year that will go down in the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the government of Mario López Valdes, also called the year of change, which generated great hopes for the development of the economy, but, given the unfavorable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, however, a decrease in the main indicators of economic development was registered.
The low temperatures of February not only led to millions of dollars in losses for the agricultural sector, but they also limited the growth potential of the state economy, causing a 3.6% decline in overall economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic 31.16% drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on frost-affected areas provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated rise in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55.053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 percent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 percent, a share that in terms of the number of people is more than 74,000 unemployed residents of Sinaloa, which is 18.969 more people compared to the first half.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is driven by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University of Sinaloa (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by the actions taken in state policy.
"What we're seeing now is rising unemployment, which is due to a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to fight money laundering, because it's not easy for people who illegally own dollars to work with them, to invest and use them in something", he said.
Suspended immigration
Lopez Cervantes said there's a demographic factor in the unemployment increase.
"The number of people who leave the state to look for work abroad in the US has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entering, and second because once they arrive, they already face many difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, and as a result, the unemployment rate is rising", he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa's analysis of the labor market gets worse when you consider the large number of violations that prevail in the labor conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the state's active population works without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities in registration, another reminder of the state's work is its low wages; the state has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5.352 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7.375 pesos.
The FDI cut
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment rate, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, with FDI in the state from January to July amounting to $630,697, which shows a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government recorded a total of 17,280,000 pesos of investments during the year, which mainly came from companies in the service sector.
The debt
Amid the economic downturn, the state government asked in July for approval of a 3 billion pesos loan at the state congress to be used for infrastructure investments in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved locally, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state's economy until November.
The reaction
For business, the first year of the Mario Lopez Valdés government is a sign of the government's lack of capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry, said that during 2011, there was a lack of coordination between the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work hard to recover the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
The slowdown in the economy
Lopez Loredo said events such as the early frosts this year have stunted the state's economy and limited its efficiency and growth.
"The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not get fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year we close it below our expectations", he said.
Revising the direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Mexican Employers in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
"In general, we found that we were working on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
Upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the efforts of the government.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program", he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own manner of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is getting involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is still a lot to do", he said.
He 's being sentenced for eight kilos of marijuana .
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days' income - that's what a citizen of Navarato was sentenced to for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office said the convicted drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, in this case, possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on June 7, 2010 during a patrol on Calle Cipriano Valdes, in front of Post 80 in El Castillo, Navolat.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck in which he was carrying a black bag in the trunk of the car, and in the passenger seat - a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized property was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Second District Court, and the defendant remains incarcerated at the Criminal Justice Center.
You have to make contributions to the work.
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk being left unfinished or long delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Municipal Director of Social Development pointed out that while the work programs have been developed so far, they are in danger because the state government is unable to make the corresponding contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programs.
He noted that the total financing of the three programs is about 50 million pesos, of which the state must contribute 25 percent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided the resources for the work, so there is still a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is ending, they have not given us a penny, when from the beginning of July they should have given us part", he said, "so as not to delay, we started the work and they have made a lot of progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilha, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the government's term, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the administration of the state.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn't have the financial means to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year to access those programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state is left to pay", he explained.
Although the state authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that the interest due to them comes as soon as possible.
"They have to pay almost 12 million, and even though the year is ending, they haven't given us a penny".
Mexico's "digital TV switchover" to be approved by court in 2015
The shift from analog to digital is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SC) has rejected constitutional challenges by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree that postpones the so-called "digital television transition" from 2021 to 2015, as it did not receive the eight votes needed to overturn it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to be taken to transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected for lack of the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of radio and television programming is a right enshrined in law by the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project, which was approved by the National Assembly.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive power could not define by general rules the measures for which the state administration should prepare.
"I also don't think that if it happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and reminded that the planning of public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to govern the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that has happened in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of digital transformation, which includes meeting societal needs that have more than just a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities that the Constitution combines into the state executive power".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done so with the help of the executive branch, despite the existence of narrowly-specific technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the government, by passing the decree under discussion, which in any case touches the competence of the Congress, ensures the compliance in the administrative sphere of the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
Michoacán is analyzing the possibility of counting "vote by vote"
According to the data provided to the VAR, the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, which comes to 879 out of the total number in 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of a "vote-for-vote" count is real, as it is in the process of this year's election in Michoacán, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PERP), the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without the counting of the votes, which comes to 879 out of a total of 6,074 minutes.
In this context, the president of the General Council of the Instituto Electoral de Michoacan (IEM), Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal Saragossa, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As a reminder, Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the state Electoral Code or the Voting Rights Act, as the state Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their enactment in this election process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication in the deadline indicated in the law in the state's Official Gazette, saying that he had some objections.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ) ruled on a constitutional claim brought by the local legislature and called the state representative's vote on constitutional reform "invalid and illegal" as he had no right to "permit or support them".
In an interview about the possibility of "vote for vote", Maria de los Angeles Lyandeal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IWM, it would be possible to present a partial or full count of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be made when: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting and counting record in the ballot box or it is not in the chairman's possession; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, a general recount of votes in all ballot boxes may be carried out when there is evidence that the difference between the presumed winner of the election in question and the runner-up is less than or equal to one percent, provided that a request is made at the beginning of the session by a representative of the party and/or coalition which has put forward the latter of the candidates.
A total recount will also be made if, at the end of the ordinary recount, it is found that the difference between the winner and the runner-up is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate came second, in the event that ballot boxes that were included in the partial recount are excluded.
It is worth noting that in such a situation is the election in Morelia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, not even counting 129 votes out of a total of 923 in the protocol.
His last will and testament .
His ashes will be scattered in the Sapaliname mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; a funeral mass was held on Monday.
According to the family, the Lt. Colonel's last will and testament was to have his ashes scattered in the Sapaliname Mountains.
After receiving condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortes family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with their closest people attending the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes were taken to the chapel located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garcia, where family and friends were gathered.
At 5:30 p.m., he was seen by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team that Felipe Bassio was a member of while in high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sapalinama mountains, he always said this to his family and friends", said Sandra Cortes Bassio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all her dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and loving brother, devoted to his family".
Felipe Cortes Basio left Saltillo at a very young age to attend the College of Aviation in Sappopan, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Marta Saagún to Saltillo".
Juno remembers that even when he was seven, he went to Sapporo to attend the graduation ceremony of his cousin, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
He's being escorted to his final destination.
Gunshots rang out in honor of Mexican Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Cortes Bassio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and made progress in both studies and sports, accompanied him to the last.
Bassio Cortes died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Morey, and six others, all representatives of this ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Basío Cortes (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral home by members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, on the training school's esplanade, where his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting for him.
Three bodies found abandoned at the Kadareit farm .
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a controlled shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadeireta Jimenez, Nuevo León.
The find was discovered 1.5 kilometers from the Kadereita highway towards Santiago, on a high ground in the commune known as El Castillo.
Several passersby noticed that the gate was wide open in the village house, whose walls were painted beige and brown.
They looked inside, and found three bodies, and they called the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Practically one meter away was the body of another man, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed in another location, since there was no casing at the scene.
There are signs on the fence of the village house addressed to one organized crime group by another, and there are several bullet holes in the gate.
11 Caught in Kadesh
The Ministry of National Security has identified 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Kadireita municipality, and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to the information published, eight people were initially detained in the colony of Los Alvero on November 11, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were given three houses and a telephone, and were required to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another incident happened on November 12th at 06:00 AM, military personnel were on patrol in the village of Old Rancho in Kadereite when they saw a car with no license plates with two men in the cabin.
Stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a magazine and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He's accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kadereita.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The newly appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present a new government that will face the crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster.
Italy's newly appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to unveil a new government that will face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to introduce a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take up his post.
Monti said he'd present the president with the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reiterate my full confidence in the ability of our country to get through this difficult period", the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monty didn't say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well defined", he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that had brought their debt levels to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore Italy's credibility.
Under pressure from Monti to hurry, volatile markets set the yield on Italy's BTP bonds at 10 years over 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marcheglia, the leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would actively support this government".
We believe this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this crisis.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on support for the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts should lead to a good outcome", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed the technocratic government majority that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to carry out reforms that will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or halting of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has stepped up the pressure, warning that the failure of Monti could be disastrous.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations, on Monday.
He'll finish his series of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, the value of Italy's debt has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will be successful.
A bailout of Italy with a public debt of €1.8 billion would be too much for the modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monti said his government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before calling new elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be made up of technical experts only, a sign of their dissatisfaction that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources have reported that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties are making it difficult to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more experience than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players signed in Spain, ten have played 50 international matches.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players on the roster has played 50 games.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 players called up by both countries for the 3:05 p.m. friendly at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, have a whole list of A-League qualifiers, the Tricolor only have defender Michael Uman as the only one to have played 50 international games.
This record was set last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandes Stadium.
Spanish players, who play in the All-Star League and in the strong English Premier League clubs, have been very active during the year in the league and in local cup competitions, and they are top-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
To this should be added the experience of the Spanish Fury in the difficult qualification for the Euro or the World Championship.
The Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a game lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of ex-goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolores and set a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Javier Hernandez, a player from Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Xavi were named last week's UEFA best along with fellow Iberia player, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and Schalke's goalscorer Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost approaching the hundred Carles Puyole with 97 games.
They are followed by Xavi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, Michael Umana is next, left-back Junior Diaz with 48 games and striker Brian Ruiz with 45.
Further, only five have crossed the 30 game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeif with 32, Michael Barranz with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest of us.
He has played more than 30 matches in Spain with Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casarla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
The team with less than 30 appearances is Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest of us didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, Jordi Alba has two, and Victor Bolivar has one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Eder have not yet made their debuts.
Spain's leading player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who scored more points, twice as many as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murrie and Parks.
The quintet has embarked on a tour of the country in honor of the twentieth anniversary of the career
'A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true'
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to play one of their best shows ever next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been over 20 years in the making, but the band says it's also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
That was the claim of bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is on a tour of South America in honor of its twentieth anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
They will perform at the National Stadium that day, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles-based band The X and the local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from a conversation that was decoded and made available online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica?
Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only our second trip to South and Central America, and so far, so good.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is a certain loyalty to the band; the fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, in anticipation of your concert, are treating it as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in São Paulo and we hope that's put us in shape for this gig in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, and as far as those two things go, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves are incredible.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, and these are great places to surf, and this is how we learned about it, from people who love to surf.
From the tour, I can tell you've put on a show with a lot of songs.
What are you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limits to what we can do.
We're going to try to make the best show possible with the most diverse songs; we're going to try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think part of the reason is that we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everyone has a different taste in music, so it's hard to pick which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, it keeps us tuned in and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore, I think, makes it more interesting for people.
You're celebrating 20 years of career with this tour.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all that you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have ever imagined that we'd be in a rock band, and the fact that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We're happy with our luck and we're very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we all love making music.
We're happy to go places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things are working out very well for us.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the grunge boom?
It's always been an honor to be a part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when a movement starts with a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it's much more bizarre when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be a part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them now and then.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be a part of the Seattle sound that's come out of it.
It's also very strange that a group like yours has stayed together and in the same lineup for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is way longer than most bands have been around.
One, I think we're lucky to be alive, and two, we care about others.
We're all very close friends, and because of that, we've also opened up musical avenues that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do everything you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
As we got older, it became easier to find balance.
We make sure we don't stay on the road too long, because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it's made of, not the decision to be famous and to be a rock star, which is something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs, and it was great in the beginning.
We were a band for almost three years and didn't release a single album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of disappointments because it had been so long, and the important thing is that we're still very close friends with Bruce and Greg, who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think about the amazing person that Andy was, and how he made me laugh, and it was always fun to go to work, and laugh, and talk about music and football and stuff.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video offers, and this was the band we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas have to offer live, and it should be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words to Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He's singing it and I think he's using whatever comes to mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Some of the first names that come to mind are Heather Butler, John Entwisle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Ducowski...
There are so many I could talk about all the bass players I love all day.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge going, even though it's no longer in vogue?
I think we all feel a certain detachment from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out around the same time, and if that's important now, I think it's great, because it's music worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
Your music was more somber at first, but now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting because, I think, there are some songs on the album that might seem lighter, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they can sound a little bit positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them, these songs are very dark.
I think that when you're growing up and you've had some kind of trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, those events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a state hospital on Tuesday to be examined for a loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fuhimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aginag, who is his personal physician, told N TV that Fujimori will be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower extremities.
Aginaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori should be a candidate for a pardon on humanitarian grounds; however, he said that he did not want to do so because he knew he was innocent.
He had four surgeries for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and had other ailments, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulation problems in his legs, the doctor listed.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the Police National Special Operations Unit.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army's destruction squad, which operated in secret during the first years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin talks on the political problems of the region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, next Wednesday, the most important item of a wide-ranging plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favorable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations", as published by the leadership of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderon's support for Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked a protest in Uruguay and a recall for consultations of his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, had a tax information exchange agreement with the South American country since January of this year to avoid double taxation.
The government of Uruguay has been trying in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax swaps agreements in order to leave this "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The plumber with a mustache will become three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil clutches, but he has never done so in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will be available in stores worldwide this month, was created with the Nintendo 3DS handheld console's characteristics in mind, which allows for three-dimensional play without the need for glasses.
"Mario is a hero who has to communicate how stereoscopy will work without glasses", said the head of Nintendo's press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the game's presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land is "Nintendo's first video game specifically designed for this platform", because up until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D have been adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo representative stated that despite being in 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an "accessible" video game that allows for fast and mobile gameplay.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to appeal to less experienced users.
Once they start, most experts will go "on second round" to the levels of the game, which are more difficult this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario Invasion also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, something that hasn't happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winked at fans of the series and repeated the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a mustache must go through dangerously mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new moves, sets, costumes, and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States .
President Álvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo had begun, so that he could face trial in the United States for conspiring to launder $70 million.
This concludes the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded Portillo be extradited to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he did not "touch" legal decisions and accepted all extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo, Sergio Ruano, Marroquin will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom did shows the execution process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted in order to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a ruling on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling Q120 million from the Ministry of Defence during the presidency, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support are important: 6,000 young people facing social isolation have been helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
And that's in addition to the hundreds of jobs that have been created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the final results at a ceremony held in the old Fabra I Coats factory, which was attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was born next to Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with education, unemployment and drug problems or who are subject to marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been cooperating with the association for 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections showed the unified character of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordi Pukhol, the ceremony was attended by the ex-consultant of the Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and the ex-Lieutenant of the Mayor and current eco-socialist, municipal council member Rikard Goma.
Also appearing in Fabra I Coats is the current consultant for social welfare and family, Josep Lewis Cleris and the CEO of social work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and instilling hope in people who are struggling.
"The crisis is not new to the organisation and the work that has been done to it", he said.
The building where the mass parties were held has been evacuated.
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building at 51 Balmes Street.
12 squatters left the building yesterday at noon without a fight .
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building they illegally occupied yesterday afternoon, where they were throwing parties that upset the neighbors, on a voluntary basis, without police intervention.
When the operation was over, the locks on the doors were changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a pass control", the manager said.
Squatters who occupied 11 of the building's 13 floors, occupied the rest, appropriated all the electricity and some of the water, painted the walls and left behind traces of all kinds, especially drinking cans.
The first three floors were the site of mass parties that lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
Just behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinata, told Europa Press that her income has fallen by 80% since the building was occupied.
The club owner says the squatters dragged her into an unfair competition, as they were selling drinks for three euros, while the club was selling for 10.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to neighbors' complaints about the noise, although, as she noticed, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The club owner said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the property owner, and for nine months now, he has been "forgiving" her rent.
City police also confirmed that they've received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the municipal group PP, councillor Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week that "the building be evacuated immediately to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have emerged among the neighbors and the degradation in this area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months, the squatters have invaded all floors and almost every room, and that some of them have been breached.
In this sense, he added that "we must put an end to impunity and firmly oppose the uncivilization that is taking place in the building".
So, yesterday, members of the police evacuated the building in New Barris.
At 3:30, the police came to 35 Montral after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree to bid after dispute over fees
The 16-door municipal contest has renewed the debate on the role of the Colserol in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona City Corporation (CCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colserolla.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital city of Barcelona.
And it was accompanied by a pictorial comparison with New York's Central Park.
With the demise of the SCB in 1987, the park has again taken a place in the minds of many as the high point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are not oriented north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Kolserol as a nature park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced a huge competition, consisting of 16 competitions for a host of other gates in the Colserola.
The gate is the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or somebody's trying to put a goal on the field.
The question is, is it a Colcerol, a park or a mountain?
The competition, and its organizational aspect, and its impact on the city, are a topic for discussion among all Barcelona architects.
It's probably the most recurring theme that's been discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people recognize each other in an elevator.
And that fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefons Serdas, the mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"You have to admit that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it's a wonderful accessibility.
The Colcerol is more complicated", says the architect, for whom the title "Coloserol gate" contains a "verbal trap": we should not think of them "as entrances to the park, but as the limitation of some zones where we must act".
Modolo, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban design, called the proposal an "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of the forecast of the public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the site of the Forum "with its swan song".
The first fear is actually the limitation of where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation for the next step", meaning the transition.
"We have to think about new urban planning tools because the current ones [in terms of the General Capital Plan (GCP) ] can lead to real trouble".
More to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work being done outside of Kalserola that "should not be overlooked", although he is grateful for the opportunity the city offers his profession to join this project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the mountain's proximity to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues) that were to create: "Architects should only be a tool".
Bayonne hints that the answer to the question posed by the title of this section is complex, as the rules of the competition lack a general view of the Colcerol: "There were 16 overlapping contests", he says, "in the sea-mountain sense, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole".
It makes it, at least in his case, 16 contests.
On the other hand, the design for one gate may overlap by program and definition with the architect's design for the neighboring gates.
From your point of view, the council should ensure that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrassabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of litigation, Red Casino's attorney has pardoned the mayor of Monterrey's brother in his extortion case.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after Red Casino's legal representative granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is prosecuting the extortion case against the mayor of Monterrey's brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia posted a series of photos and videos allegedly showing Manuel Jonas demanding he pay a financial contribution to the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation at the gambling house.
After a public condemnation, the State General Prosecutor opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2 he was arrested and jailed for 30 days.
After four hours before the agent of the State Ministry of Crimes of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed in that place for 49 days, following the second order's prohibition of movement after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadeiraito allegedly for extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with a medium degree of isolation of prisoners, because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his sentence in the municipal prison of San Nicolás in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was enough evidence to convict Jonas, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the bookmakers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for a pardon for the brother of the regional mayor, so that in the next few hours he could be released.
During the hearing, the state prosecutor, Ramiro Arias, asked if Garcia had paid damages and which of the partners of the gambling house would grant a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to mention the name.
Based on the 197/2011 record, a legal pardon has been granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and after that no statements can be made about the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation and punishment be required.
After a hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 3:50 p.m., it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
A court official, Jorge Janez, went to the San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Perez Harcomé is giving details of the crash that killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MCT) said that the results of the accident, in which Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter had crashed directly into the ground in a complete state of integrity, without any attempt by the pilot to make an emergency landing.
During the press conference, Dionisio Perez Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot had determined that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the vessel had a few contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the vehicle lost its flyscale".
He also reported that the vessel was designed for 19 people, thus it met the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that the tests conducted in the area of the impact did not report the presence of particles on the ground.
"The study reports that no other ship components were present, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was designed to carry 19 passengers, which satisfied the relevant requirements for passenger transportation.
The ground here is between seven and 30 degrees inclined.
At this point, the secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, CEO of Airports and Support Services, said that the presidential helicopter was cruising at the time of the crash and that it had hit soft, rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis that the aircraft was in normal flight at the time of impact", he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hakome listed six important elements in the investigation:
The visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was operated under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions are:
AICM reports indicated conditions suitable for take-off as the aircraft headed for the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
The selected routes:
It's possible that due to the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower altitude and higher visibility area in the Cuernavaca Valley.
The hit.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar record of the aircraft match, so it's likely there was no loss of control or change of direction before the impact.
The scattered debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the blow was delivered to the front and the side line.
The scattered debris suggests that the helicopter struck the ground with structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were detected:
There's unidentified evidence of a shipwreck, some kind of explosion or fire in the crash zone.
Recent studies suggest that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During the work on the site were found pieces of aircraft at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several ground collisions.
After a thorough search of a larger area than the demarcated area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred in a structural integrity condition.
MSS announces program to search for gene of obesity
Social Protection leads research to find the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by experts from the IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute (MSSI) announced that it is conducting a study to detect the gene of obesity in children and young people, which has been named the "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence" protocol, which will provide a count of signs associated with excess weight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Division of the Hospital Especializado del Centro Médico Nacional del Siglo XXI, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The public (registered or not) is invited to participate by visiting the MSSI Sports Centers participating in the study in the Valley of Mexico, where tests will be conducted with children every Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began at the sports center in Cuautemoc (in the west of the state of Mexico), and since October 8 the events are held in the sports center in Nesahualcoyotl (east of the state of Mexico).
Once the target of 500 to 600 children has been reached, the study will continue at Independencia Sports Center (south of Mexico City) and finally at Morelos Sports Center (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify a risk factor among children and adolescents in Mexico to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
November 14th is World Diabetes Day, and the main goal is to get 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 years old, with parental consent and supervision, to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) would be carried out.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects health professionals' concern about the alarming increase in childhood obesity.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that in just 6 years, there was a rise: 77 percent of boys were obese, 47 percent of girls; as for excess weight, there was also a significant rise", said the MSSI specialist.
He said the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from other peoples because of its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and five percent African, and that this condition affected genes that are associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that the main cause of obesity's genetics is the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), and it's stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which can reveal whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark wrinkles on the neck and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled with the utmost confidentiality, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home watching TV, and using public transportation for short distances instead of walking.
It also happens because of high calorie consumption, which means an increase in the consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic predisposition, analyzed in this program.
UNAM asphalt will be able to avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM's Department of Chemistry, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a blend of the highest quality, resistant to environmental and temperature influences.
If the signals sent by the pavement were taken into account, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 holes for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Najera, a researcher at the UNAM's Department of Chemistry, adding that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavement were correct, the number of holes could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture, Technology View of Pits, delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Najera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, like some cities in the north, to improve the quality of the roads and therefore counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some high-molecular-weight, called asphaltenes, and some low-molecular-weight, called maltenes, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
Bitumen's viscous behavior lies in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures bitumen becomes brittle, he said.
This means that the resistance of the asphalt is not constant, but changes throughout the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineering specialist.
A chemist has observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is bitumen, which is made up of small stones that are lowered into the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up that coating, he said, is soaked in bitumen.
When moving vehicles and applying effort, this helps to distribute forces very well on the road surface.
If it was modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On top of the asphalt, he added, is a last layer, called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, actually sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle, it must have greater resistance than the asphalt and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute this stress, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the soil is wet, water penetrates the coating and has difficulty getting out, causing all the layers of the coating to soften and, therefore, to form pits.
When pits are formed, he said, the first layer of wear and tear is applied and only then does it affect the bitumen, but the damage is not instantaneous, a process that should be addressed at the first signs of ongoing repair programs.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating layer should always be associated with the transport load and it is necessary to guarantee the fulfillment of this requirement to prevent the frequent occurrence of holes.
Rafael Herrera said that there is still a lot to be studied and done about bitumen, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to repair pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Vallejo miss to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from being crowned Miss Colombia.
The representative of the Valley has received the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has nothing but the desire to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the scepter, the department counts 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were declared princesses, among them are Mirías Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borreiro Domínguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alcate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Sonsola Piéndo (1990), Diana Iacábal (1993), Hirossié Aljara (2000), Hidalgo Caná (2007), Roxana Steffani (2008).
The question that many people ask today is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of her performances has shown that she has everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not for nothing she was elected Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Face according to Vogue - titles that were held by the Queen, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who were crowned Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she could not convincingly answer the question "Which book characterizes you and why?", asked by Martin Muriel Gomez of the Let's Read Literary Society.
She said to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of acculturation, and I definitely think the book that characterized my childhood  The Little Prince is a pretty profound book.
Today I am reading "Crime and Punishment", a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; and I am also reading at this moment a book by Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Blood Heat".
The answer that the jury didn't like because of the term "cultivation" and secondly because it didn't explain specifically how each of the books quoted characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with her outcome: "The universe is wise, what is happening is what should happen".
And all of you, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses voiced, Vallière was burned out by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that, as she was preferred, she was greeted with applause, and was the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Osteras culinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, provoked stress in the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage".
And it was marked during her first appearance in a swimsuit at the Hilton Beach and during her two appearances at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was obvious that she lacked the strength and energy that the Magdalene and Atlantico had displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN's "Like Home" program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition does not become a queen".
Also, Vallier's representative has been avoiding contact with the press lately, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the Vallejo representative failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why two days before the election, Lucy Doty, a member of the international jury, said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the outward appearance and focus on the public consciousness, before they enter the competition, they have to be involved in the projects", she said.
There is also speculation that Vallee was guilty of belly-related fibrosis and belly-related belly-related belly-related belly-related fibrosis, but this is disputed, as the jury singled her out as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The Queen's advisor Jorge Hernán Orosco notes that Melina did not have the best body, that she was better, "but fibrosis problems on her stomach, which were not very noticeable to me, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgery.
"Operations are good, but Representative Vallier doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was presented for the first time by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prophecy came true last night, it is said that it was the devil that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for the fact that she had lost the pleasure of receiving the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact is that today Melina begins her year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated directly by the organizers of the National Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena pageant, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A forensic scientist from Cali made history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is crucial.
On November 4, CTI forensic scientist Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC leader Alfonso Cano by matching his fingerprints.
Of the seven forensic scientists working at CTI, this week it was the turn of Elízar González, a Puerto Tejada man who spent 21 years in the field of forensic investigations.
Early in his career, González worked in the Choco towns, where he often had to wade through jungles for more than five days to reach the location of bodies to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the Valleys and after completing the corresponding courses he became a specialist in the field of criminology, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and sticks.
The week of Elizardo's operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take no more than three days' worth of clothing.
Something great was coming.
He arrived Friday night on a helicopter from Kauka to Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of the prints of Guillermo Leon Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the location of the body, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and considerably thin.
But the prints are real.
Using a magnifying glass, ink, a shovel and a flashlight, Elizar matched the corpse's fingerprints to those on the photos.
His eyes were right: it was Alfonso Cano.
That night, a representative of Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinson, that he was the head of the RVC.
Fingerprinting is
For the dactyloscopy specialist of the Sijin unit in Cali, the confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos by Elizaro González at a press conference on the operation against Cano is of particular significance.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without error, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, fingerprint experts are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and identify detainees.
When caught, many criminals have fake IDs or no documents.
We're gonna take their prints and run them through the database.
The investigator said that in the case of theft, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house because this is where the thief had reached with his hands to take possession of a safe full of jewels and money.
"Walls are difficult to work with because they are not convenient surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and establish the identity of the criminal who was involved in several thefts", he states.
Fingerprints also help rule out or establish suspects' involvement in murder-related cases.
A man was recently found dead with liquor bottles around him.
The investigation established that a relative could be a suspect in the crime, and indeed, the fingerprints on the bottle matched.
While it doesn't guarantee he was the killer, it does prove he was at the scene.
A fingerprint specialist at CTI explained that where there are fingerprints, a chemical or physical agent is applied.
When they do, a spatula or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or entered into a register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians", said the CTI expert.
He explained that it wasn't like it was on the CSI TV show.
Just as not all gold that sparkles, not everything you touch leaves a mark.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
The Angry Men are challenging the authority of New York City.
Hundreds of protesters have set up camp outside Zukkotti Square.
A group of protesters heard the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Occupy Wall Street challenged New York City authorities Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn, under the protection of a court order, to take over another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at Zuccotti Square, where they hoped to reach thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to set up camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the dispersal by seizing a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that since the court won't let us camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal fight to return to Zucotti through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a representative of Occupy Wall Street.
Bray explained that the response of "angry people" to the tent city evacuation, ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling prohibiting the forced evacuation of the square and allowing the protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, "angry people" have begun to seize a new park located at the junction of Central Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could have occupied the site for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not give an exact number, but told Efe that he saw several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization says several hundred people were camping at the site where a delegation of religious leaders had come to show support for the members of the movement, trying to mediate negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning's dispersal of protesters.
Some of the protesters who were heading there were carrying and distributing copies of the court ruling at the same time and even giving these copies to the police officers guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes", said Bray, who said that some police officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members and enforcing "laws that were issued after the seizure began or from preventing protesters from re-entering the park with shops and other property that they had previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city suspended the opening of the public space and the protesters were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to unveil tent shops and sleeping bags again.
A municipal council member personally justified the dawn removal of protesters from Zuccotti Square, an operation that resulted in about 200 arrests, and the decision to do so because the protesters were "breaking the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the clearance of the square because it was becoming "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "a deterioration in the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was abhorrent and shows that at heart Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers", added a spokesman for the movement, who condemns the mayor for "disrespecting freedom of speech".
Occupy Wall Street also indicated that they intend to organize "grand rallies" on Thursday in cooperation with civil society organizations and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program Russell Peters Christmas on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on The Big Repair, a lifeguard on The Malibu Rescuers, Bunny on Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1st program Russell Peters Christmas, as the very special Mary.
CTV released footage today of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely circulated Internet home pornography video featuring her and her then-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary, holds a doll in her arms that depicts Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed as the host in Charlie Sheen's My Cruel Torpedo of Truth tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March and is also a scandal-buster.
Recently, Bublé called Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Rebuilt After the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% on the back of domestic consumption, ending a downturn that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that triggered the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster to hit the Land of the Rising Sun since World War II.
The Tokyo government's initial estimate of the damage was $300,000,000,000 - a blow that, despite the dire global situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive losing quarters, July to September gross domestic product figures have definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% year-on-year.
Recorded in the second quarter, the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% against a 0.9% decline in capital expenditure seen from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
But the true breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse to use the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, largely due to the rise of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This figure increased by 1% due to the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure.
The seal of the yen
Tokyo has given the domestic market a privilege that is crushing the accounts of exporting companies, as the yen, the Japanese currency, has become one of the "refuge currencies" chosen by investors who want to get rid of the eurozone debt crisis and negative forecasts regarding the United States.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of big tech companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for their low July to September performance.
As markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yeshiko Noda is not letting up on its guard.
We must be alert to ongoing risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of economic activity decline in September.
The indicator, which predicts a reversal in the global economy, showed that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average, which is at 100 points, after it plunged eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is giving ground to doubt again
Papademos said the amendment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk premia and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze that leads to the exit from Europe's great debt crisis.
The feeling that the "agreement" of the new transitional government of Ellada is imposed by Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon upon for his appointment may not be sufficient to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assures that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit, Papademos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
The package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything".
The Conservative leader took a step forward in his feelings towards the EU and the IMF, the organizations that must unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement to the treaty's requirements.
But the European Commission, still fretting over the fallout from Papandreou's all-or-nothing referendum claims, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece's main parties sign "a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafay said the troika inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8.000 million, although the exact date has not been set.
There's enough yarn in a Greek straw for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen has emphasized Spain's "primary" position in relation to this type of finance.
"Spain has taken a leading position in the world in the field of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades the country has become the second largest donor of cooperation instruments, whose "essence", she said, is that they are "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on faith in people".
The Queen opened the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit yesterday in Valladolid, saying that there is "no doubt" that such action is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "specifically to halve the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is set".
Spain "is still working" to expand its network of beneficiaries around the world and is taking this task "responsibly", says Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans".
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is not only a platform for debate, but also a platform that promotes "two main goals".
So Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and a hundred million of these households will be lifted out of the poverty they are in.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "went along the path started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofía emphasized, as an "act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of the instrument as "a striking idealist in the universal cause of fighting poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, from the time the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I saw continuous development", said Her Majesty, whose connection to this project earned her the title of "head of the family" yesterday, the "banker of the poor" gathered in Valladolid.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by calling on the audience to engage in discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
The Ethical Imperative
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it is a "permanent commitment".
Jimenez concluded that microcredit implies "a serious and firm course towards poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of cooperation for development".
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to people "who are deprived and have closed all doors", while the mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in a city that "opens its doors, in a spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, was a smooth one for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but emerged in the autumn itself, in part to satisfy activists who believe that the government's policy is far from as strict as it should be, today towards Greece and perhaps tomorrow towards Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, tabled by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted several minutes, and which were deserved by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, the Euro-friendly finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: "Not less Europe, but more Europe" is the right response to the crisis.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "it is time for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that would allow for greater European Union control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suffrage, "to give Europe a face".
Anyway, it's one of the proposals in the draft resolution passed by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the 27 countries will agree to this decision quickly; the UK is against it, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it too.
But the ground is set.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight the vote of each EU member state in the European Central Bank's board according to the size of its economy, which would have significantly increased the weight of the German economy.
Wanting to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation who like to criticize "arrogant" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes a whole paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing through.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is sick leave fraud?
Following the cash benefits, the UMP and the government launched an offensive on hospital records.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family allowance fund and give a speech on the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, of fighting fraud in the area of social benefits.
And to help that offensive, which is driven by the need to save money in a tough situation, but also part of the right-wing campaign for re-election, most want to focus on sick days.
First of all, in order to save money, the government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on private company employees before the benefits start.
Obviously, without the employer's specific consent, the sick employee will lose four days' pay, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
A move that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And it will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose a one-day sick leave on public servants (public servants have not had to wait for their sickness benefits until now, unlike private sector workers who have had to wait three days).
Now, when these issues are being discussed, most also bring up fraud again, meaning abuse in the issuance of hospital records.
The control will be more strict and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have received illegally", warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL channel on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leaves.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant surveillance and political attacks, which have borne fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the numbers by country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros in daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, the daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros, representing 5% of total health care costs.
Of this, 46% was for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sickness benefits, amounting to 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore, they accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenditures.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on sick leave in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An arithmetic average that hides some discrepancies; another study published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010, 37% of hospital stays lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures with those of its European neighbours, you can see that French workers are no more likely to take sick leave than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence rate from work in France (whether for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The rate of sick-leave fraud is very low compared to the gray jobs.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 led to systematic checks of patients lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases examined, the CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 short-term illness reports were "unjustified" or too long", which amounts to 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which equals 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were "unfounded" among the several million workers who received sick leaves.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, say, the employment "gray" numbers.
According to UMP MP Dominic Tian, who authored a report on the issue in June, they account for between 9 and 15 billion euros of unreceived budget revenues per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was stated by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in parliament on Monday, November 14, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to accomplish this task.
"To achieve the goal of rescuing the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of budget adjustment", said the prime minister, who made his first public statement, opening the vote of confidence debate in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October should be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the eurozone is "put on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit to "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right-wingers reject new government measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said at a meeting with lawmakers from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the goals of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any policy that impedes economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for Economy and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary 8 billion euro loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians are denied the right to die, says Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee says that the government, health institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, not to mention cancer.
Canadians are denied the right to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The committee proposes that the government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the choice is forced by circumstances and the patient is considered competent to make such a decision.
To start with, the experts cite a recent study by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to discuss death".
Medication or not, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reach a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in its application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide for people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, confirmed during a teleconference by Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it's clearly illegal.
Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll, they believe it will allow people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for people who have assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear-cut when it comes to extending or ending medical care, the report's authors say.
They also propose, among other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legally valid termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the spirit of respect for refusing medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
As for palliative care, the committee calls on the government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, and not just for cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health-care institutions, the committee requires that it be used when it is not used to dull physical pain, as is euthanasia, and subject to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some experts in the field of health-care legislation have already commented on the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
M. Pierre Deschan, a health-care law expert, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme" because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide, says Mr. Deschan, who summarized the report yesterday.
Meter Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society".
Health-care law expert Margaret Somerville also expresses "strong disagreement with the report's conclusions, which she called a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, has specifically challenged the report's findings regarding abuses in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on President Assad to relinquish power
Damascus condemns the "conspiracy" that has been waged against the government.
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure was mounted on Syria by Bashar Assad, who, with Russian support, is resisting him and denouncing a "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after Syria's suspension from the Arab League, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan called for President Assad's resignation.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to relinquish power in Syria, where some forty civilians and members of the regime's armed forces have been killed.
"If Bashar cared about his country's interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions for a new phase of political life", the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, told the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, have not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country that Turkey is taking a increasingly tough line on.
For its part, the United States welcomes the "widening consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly hard line on the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's armed forces were killed in the Der'aa district in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reported.
Two other residents were killed in a shootout and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said the country was nearing the end of the crisis".
He also reacted sharply to the Arab League's decision to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the Arab League is currently studying "the mechanism for the protection of civilians and demands the deportation of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also spoke in favor of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime that he said had fallen into "paranoia".
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for Rabat tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the November 2 exit plan, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where fighting is taking place and the release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China called for Syria to implement a plan to end the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy and
Monti demands time from the markets and sacrifices from the Italians.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and to carry out a program that would require "sacrifices" to restore the credit lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner was involved in a debate with political parties yesterday before a meeting with trade unions and employers today.
He would have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, made up of technocrats who are not in parliament.
Monti spoke about the importance of a program that involves many victims, said Francesco Nuchara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minister candidate.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on a confidence motion by Friday to ensure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
"Democracy requires time to prepare a government and a programme", he stressed, adding that he was confident that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but the unrest has re-emerged, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The prime minister-designate was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, though he stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should be in place until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from the parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti has assured that, once in office, he will work hard to ensure that Italy is once again a major player in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not meet the budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, has demanded, in particular, new strict measures.
Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that does not have growth cannot comply with the parameters of the deficit".
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", a "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the authors of the pioneers.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as Italy must pay back €200 billion in public debt by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in a nuclear weapon, the U.S. agency that specializes in nuclear weapons confirmed Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is relying on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to establish the identity of the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military aspect" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years "since the 1960s at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds for blasting techniques".
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to set up a company producing "nano diamonds" in Kiev.
Financial difficulties of his company brought him into contact with the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
The IAEA report mentions "clear indications that Iran's development" of nuclear detonator systems "was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only had a good knowledge of the technique but also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on the technology as part of his home country's military nuclear program".
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, anti-Muslim crimes increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of violent incidents against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which equals a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14% increase in religious-related crimes overall.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that the number of these crimes is rising again, Human Rights First stressed, adding that "the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant".
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered as serious human rights violations", added Paul Legendre, a senior executive at Human Rights First.
"The American government can and should do more to tackle these crimes", he adds, suggesting that this can be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes".
"Hate crimes" in federal law are a legacy of the civil rights era.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence based on race, color, religion, nationality and, more recently, sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform to become more like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to its platform that will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, making the service similar to Facebook.
The new activity tab and new name tag make it easier and more direct to follow the activity of other Twitter users, the users whose posts you follow, and the people who follow yours.
It lets you know if they've posted, if they've signed up to new accounts, if they've had their favorites posted, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before going live across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known for being intuitively vague and using vague terms (RT for re-posting someone else's post, #followfriday for recommending to follow other users), is now opening itself up to a wider audience by introducing something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
Users discussed the new feature on the web using tweets.
"It's useless and intrusive and too much like Facebook".
The feature will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter feed, @dannykronstrom wrote.
The Austrian
The introduction of the "golden rule" of the budget into the constitution
The leadership of the grand coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's public credit rating (triple A) by rating agencies.
Chancellor Werner Feimann, a Social Democrat, announced the decision personally at the end of the cabinet meeting, with Austria's public debt at 74.6%, well above the upper 60% norm set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's solvency had dropped by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three thousand million euros more in interest each year, argued the Christian Democrat vice-chancellor and foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus fulfilling the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of state and government demanded that budget deficits be reduced by the end of 2012 and that balanced public accounts be restored through a constitution or an equivalent law.
The decision by the Austrian government resembles the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget must be reduced by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year must not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the land, like the municipalities, must present balanced budgets.
The goal is to get the public debt to fall below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
I 'm not sure .
threatens a new intervention in the currency market .
Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that Japanese authorities will intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene as we did last time, if we take into account the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to almost historic levels, prompting Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has been rising steadily, driven by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these troubled times of economic downturn around the world and debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
The rise of the Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the amount of foreign income Japanese firms receive when converted into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern region of Tohoku, emphasized Mr. Noda, who fears that the rise of the yen will kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world's third largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5% over the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth of exports and consumption of households hit by the catastrophe
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect "Japan's fundamental economic performance".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But deputy governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps", indicating that no further easing of the environment was to be expected.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased its purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (€47,000,000), raising to 55,000 million yen (€519,000,000) the ceiling of the amount it allocates to buy various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
The euro area
The rates are rising, the stock market is fluctuating.
The risk of a debt crisis is undermining European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European stock exchanges went a little further into the negative zone this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and ended trading at 3.064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and the London by 0.1%.
With the new credit crunch in the eurozone countries, stock markets around the world are continuing to lose some of their recent gains.
"Suspecting investors are just too worried about the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7% amid fresh doubts among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its sights on Europe, and the exchanges will follow one after another in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have proof that the situation has stabilized", states Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return to anxiety about the future of the eurozone is hitting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
Brokers said it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party convention on Monday passed a resolution that, among other things, provides for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are substantially above 6%
Interest rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level that is very worrying.
This morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield on Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These interest rate difficulties in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the participants.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the stock exchange for time to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened with paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that implementing the decisions made at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be his government's "main task".
Spain has been hit by a market firestorm ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections.
The spread between the interest rates on the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Waiting for growth figures in the eurozone
France posted 0.4% economic growth in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised downward the second quarter, with a 0.1% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And the economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogma .
If there is one issue that cannot be decided by a short debate or by an emotional one, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It's a healthy trend that the election is becoming a time to reflect on the role and place of nuclear power.
The debate will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed have been examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
With seven billion people on the planet today, the demographic growth will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world's population is deprived of the vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing fossil resource deficit to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalances - a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of those factors.
That's why Germany is alone in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which is making its decision based on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or with Switzerland, which is planning to build only the most advanced reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil - these are just a few of the countries that are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States decided to add one more to its kit after Fukushima, resuming construction of a station that had been suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The Berlin Wall will result in higher electricity costs, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by an increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a surge in carbon dioxide emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
Consider the example of Denmark.
Europe's champion in turbine construction, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to its intermittent wind; which has caused carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices to be 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to our consistent energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalised economy the price of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and the key to the maintenance of industrial equipment on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make the beautiful claims of our country's new industrialization and consumer protection illusory.
A price that most French people refuse to pay, especially since they don't object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole host of small and medium-sized enterprises specialising in international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6 billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to last 60 years if his manufacturer was scheduled to close?
To solve the energy equation, we must recognize that there is no divine or diabolical source of energy.
Areva's development of low carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is a matter of vital importance.
In France, we have a security agency that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres such as Flamenville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are filled with the same obsession with safety.
In the last 50 years, the nuclear industry has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences to humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it learned from the previous two.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that makes it possible to counter such phenomena.
As it is viewed by all energy professionals who wish to build a reactor, stopping construction at Flamanville would be a great gift to rivals Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial position of our country.
Immigration - a burden or a boon for the economy?
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative services, the subordination of the numbers policy and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights state".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which made headlines when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation, May 23) declared that France "did not need foreign talents, masons and waiters".
But it's very rarely analyzed from an economic standpoint.
The right and the left agree on many points.
On the right, Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 said that "900,000 unemployed people would not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left, Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor of the world".
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the Polish water supply system was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they are willing to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande went beyond the platitudes, saying that "working together will solve our immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give you an electoral advantage, but it's very costly economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in their recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (People of Distinction: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Determine Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Restricting immigration leads to weaker growth and lower employment.
The fear of the influence of immigrants is based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially those with low skills, and cause a decline in wages.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are far more likely to supplement than replace the local workforce by doing jobs that are lacking in the local workforce.
The unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract the local workforce, and the highly skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarity that exists between the locals and the immigrants results in the arrival of the immigrants having a positive impact on the wages of the local workers.
Giovanni Parry has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flow leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this is not to mention the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants is a catalyst for new ideas and economic growth (a large share of the American Nobel Prize winners are naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute a net benefit to the social security system, contributing on average 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labor Organization estimates that in Germany, for example, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring an average net profit (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to the state budget during his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to "tooth" to cling to the missing growth points.
The teeth that were used to scare off immigrants had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it is only a question of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it has lived through the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some felt that if democracy was to win the final victory over its enemies, it was enough to organize the voting and make it as direct as possible.
Ever since Napoleon the Small, it's been known that it comes from the surface of thinking.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become "an instrument of repression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is first and foremost a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the truth-or-false Greek referendum will have a double-edged revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for a major change in policy and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted, and in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We gain nothing by demanding a series of national referendums organized as needed and in a haphazard manner.
Cart-blank for the absolute European monarch or a bound-legged plunge into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of the implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of choice and democracy, this time at a pan-European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more there are, because there is only one crisis, the European crisis.
The whole of Europe is being dictated by markets and rating agencies, suffering from its own weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The European project must be brought back under the sovereignty of the people.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce the burden of debt on each other, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The solution to the crisis will require decisions at pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After much debate, the Socialists and Jacques Delors have proposed a European economic government.
Let it be.
But to imagine it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has brought citizens to life, is another folly and a new dead end.
We must begin a new phase in the construction of Europe.
To establish a republic in France, you had to "create" republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
That lesson is still valid.
We must build a Europe that is economically united.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European sovereignty of the people.
To create Europe, let us create the Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are becoming more common.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, outside Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 billion units.
The most important sector is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or shopping simply by swiping a card over a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless cards will be sold worldwide, up from 320 million the year before!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will amount to almost 10% of the world chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of contactless payments.
There are about 26 million Visa cards that are already enabled, and they're accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts from a more modest position: there are 400,000 Visa contactless cards in circulation.
But the big stores are picking up the pace.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes this year.
To get to higher speeds, banks need to equip their customers with the hardware.
"Two large organisations in France have promised to systematically distribute contactless banking cards to their customers in the future", said Gérard Nebois, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments.
But this is just the first stage of the future of the means of payment, the mobile phone.
Few devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to make such transactions.
"They were delayed.
"But they should really take off next year".
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that it would conduct an experiment from December to June next year in Cannes.
Approximately 200 customers and employees will have their iPhones equipped with contactless payment cases.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it was preparing to launch a market offering that would allow its customers to pay through their mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb's ties to the Boko Haram sect.
Long-suggested links between the Muslim Maghreb's Al-Qaeda terrorist group (Aqmi) and Nigeria's Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algerians are now convinced of this.
"The methods used by the two organizations and the intelligence reports indicate that they are actively cooperating", he explained, without going into details.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger in January has revealed two links.
Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Lecourcourc and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers in an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the wreckage of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
Axis of terror
Analysis of the calls revealed several callers in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, the northern Nigerian city that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other a man allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we certainly have to wait for more solid evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly apparent in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now pressuring Abuja to address the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people who are not interested.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri by a mosque, school and the imam-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Hausa means "Western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
The organization was a quick success in this poor region.
It is politicised and demands strict Sharia observance, and its activists have started a struggle against the corrupt central government.
It's targeted primarily at churches, bars and government agencies.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction is as uncompromising as ever.
The army blockaded the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yousuf, captured alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will move beyond its northern home.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram staged its first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the local United Nations office will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is a concern for all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi entrenched in Mali and Niger and Somali al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world as seen by Republican presidential candidates
With China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are competing in simplicity and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been making the loud but detailed statements on foreign policy that have traditionally been a strong Republican position.
The slogans about China, Iran and aid to Israel are often conflated.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate for the nomination from the "Old Good Party", threatened to sue the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency - a sensitive issue for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
"The worse it will be if it leads to a trade war", he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with a background in complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome a position that indulged emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who has been holding the bottom of the rankings, has gone unheard.
In the Reagan style.
Romney also promised to launch a military strike against Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran", he declared.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have a bomb".
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of not delivering on his promises to that partner.
Businessman Herman Kane, the second-ranked candidate, has demonstrated a disheartening lack of business acumen.
He recently called for countering the Chinese military threat, because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power - apparently not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and is pushing for military strikes on Iran, says he's ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
Recourse to torture of terrorism suspects, which Obama outlawed in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
This is a far cry from 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, the foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan had simple ideas too and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama was an amateur himself and that he had to tone down the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on his failure of naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the "kids" from Iraq, on his ruses in Libya that earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offense is not that easy.
The public sees a positive national security balance under Obama, who eliminated bin Laden.
After Iraq, it doesn't believe in military intervention that gets stuck in the sand.
And when he says that America needs to be rebuilt economically to regain its leadership, Obama is right.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas into Europe.
The Nord Stream pipeline, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly under the Baltic Sea, is now in operation.
It's designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russia's largest gas producer, wanted to celebrate the occasion with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday's opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly underwater, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra performances and fine dining.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte have together turned the symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new pipeline will provide an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of gas to Western Europe each year via the first pipeline, which will be 1,224 kilometers long and will connect the Leningrad region with the Mecklenburg-Pomerania land.
The second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all of France's consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, without having to go through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The two countries will lose some of their power: it will be harder for them to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop at comparing Nord Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
It means it's politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a rift between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already running low.
"This pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically connects us", said Francois Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom's leaders, who were present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas's arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel, encased in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, we had to bypass the minefields left over from World War II.
"The clock had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Many steps were also needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake, equal in weight to 242 Eiffel Towers, with no breaks along its length, no vents and no service stations.
A control platform was planned for Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian state-owned company would permanently settle on its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we can cut off the gas in less than a minute", says Jens Muller.
So if there's a leak, the gas in the pipeline will be blown away.
But that seems unlikely to designers who designed seams that only leak once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that the ship pulls for external observation, as well as by the apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into a pipe of 1 metre diameter and pushed forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is only by its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom gave this company a 20-year lease with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
"Gazprom will pay for the full amount, regardless of how much gas is actually transported", Jens Muller claims.
The construction of the pipeline was financed by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be 7.4 thousand million euros for the two pipelines.
GDF Suez's investment will be around 240 million.
The nano-military shareholders are confident that they will recoup their costs because Gazprom is taking all the risks.
The pipeline runs from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
The valves are 4.5 meters high and form the gas terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before it is pumped into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, that's 3 million per hour, and in 2012, that's 6 million.
A Moleskine brand notebook .
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will bring back the flavor of writing.
It has the smell of adventure, of hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized by its rectangular black cover, by its gum, by its yellowish-white pages, as if they had turned yellow with time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to launch designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique of moleskin, a lacquered cotton cloth used to cover benches, for example.
It is said that this type of notebook is highly prized by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to the forefront of today's taste an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century", said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a brand manager at Modo Modo.
The luck is here.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% to 12.7 million units.
We've come a long way from the early years, when there were only 3,000 notebooks produced.
Moleskine has crossed the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the USA.
It's hard to profile a typical customer because the notebook appeals to businessmen, college students, and freelancers alike.
Moleskine's customers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which started with only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, small-town shops and has gained wide recognition.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this new need for writing, despite the advent of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural trait has accompanied Moleskine's development; the brand recently organized the "Round Road" exhibition, where architects and artists showcased their own block art.
In August, he also launched a leopard cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include handbags, pen, computer bags, and all kinds of support.
A success that generated envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is still twice the average, namely 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraged you?
"No", says Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, the organization that organizes the Disabled Employment Week.
"In 15 years, we have made significant progress".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times higher".
"But there is still much work to be done".
I have to say, there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Among them, the elderly are more numerous: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They are more likely to be low-skilled: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 have disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very high, at 85% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are at the heart of the problem", says Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
Needless to say, the mentality is changing, but too slowly.
A study commissioned by the Cité and carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association showed that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "imagined people in wheelchairs or mentally or intellectually disabled".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of having 6% of employees with disabilities, set in a law passed in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6%.
"Today we are at about 3%", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with the law.
Proof: the number of 'taxable' organisations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59 000 to 46 000 organisations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that raised the tax put a lot of pressure on the companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a growing awareness, particularly in large enterprises".
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82% of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
"What happiness"
Before the fight against the Blues on Tuesday night at 8:45 pm, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens made no secret of the pleasure they derived from this friendly match.
We're not going to go so far as to say that there was a collusion between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Lecens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his striker's performance in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he's Belgian".
"I want to go further", assures Lille's player.
That the contrast between his achievements at club and national team is one, he justifies.
"I'm in Lille all year long, but not in Belgium".
"I have to earn points".
Left out of the squad ahead of this match against France, the match against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally shine.
But not without mentioning the concept of "pleasure".
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them", he testifies.
That, of course, also enhances the special nature of this match.
Especially since on the other side are Mattie (Debuschi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"Just our paths crossed".
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leakes has a nice memory of pride.
Pride to play in the holiday match.
Pride also claimed as a "neighbour" that France "was once again a team of a very high level" just a year after the injury in Nice.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician will be on the same plane as the Blue team... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing", he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll see it in future games, including this one against France".
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal's Paulo Bento begins his return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to it, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the national team, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is just 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to be played, and a Bosnia to be won.
With Friday's score at zero to zero in Zenitsa's hell, it's clear the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, they failed to achieve the cherished goal that would have calmed them down.
"It's a good result, but it comes with a certain risk".
But back home, in their brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced they will pass, in front of a crowd that should be delighted, even though the match will be very tense", said optimistic but discerning Bento.
"We are expecting a very tight game, but we are convinced that we can win", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of making it to Euro 2012", said Karlus Keiros, the club's successor.
A draw against Bosnia on Friday requires a win for Portugal.
Nobody could do the Bosnians.
"This is a good result, but it does come with some risks", Bentout said.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical merit and a team with a lot of individual merit", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not giving them time to think".
Good idea, but this time it's realistic.
