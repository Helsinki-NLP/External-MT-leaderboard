28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco store
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was on the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, adding: "He's finally starting to make it".
The body found in Westfield Mall Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a Boston chef, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We have a small team working as a close-knit family, and we will miss him very much", the spokesman said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and condolences go out to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had been sleeping in hostels at first, but that recently he was finally starting to get along.
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind heart and a big heart.
"When he wanted to reconnect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner", said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to get into any fights.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was a diamond in the rough, shining every day", he said.

The Czech railways invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They got air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state-owned carrier has invested over SEK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are now air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new closed-loop toilet system.
However, the amounts for the modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are now air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new closed-loop toilet system.
The money invested was reflected in a reduction in the average age of the locomotives and individual units by two years and of the classic wagons by six years.
The largest share of investments was made by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60% of the money was directed, and 40% was invested in the renovation of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of the locomotive and the units is currently 19 years.
However, upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not taken into account, the average age of the CZ's drive vehicles would increase by 10 years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years, including the modernization.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
However, in recent years, classic sets consisting of wagons and locomotives have gradually disappeared from the Czech and world railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223, and the number of classic wagons also decreased from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier disposed in particular of old vehicles fitted with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
Between January and July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
The investments in the fleet that the Czech Republic plans to make in the near future include, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the Prague-Bratislava-Budapest international route, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic expressway.
The contract provides for the purchase of up to 30 motor units and 20 electric units.
The authorities have known about the illegal advertising for four years, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For the fourth year running, the editorial board of the online newspaper Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in the south of the Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where not only is a tourist attraction a walk in the treetops, but also the Olympic Park.
The highway patrol knows it's black, but they say they can't help it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of these ads all over the country.
Officials say the fault lies with a flawed law that prevents illegal mobile billboards from being removed immediately.
It takes a complicated bureaucratic cycle first.
Meanwhile, the company's changing its name and the office is short.
Or you can move the ad a few feet and the official process has to start all over again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted four years ago: on the main road from Český Budějovice to Lipno, there is a black billboard on our land by the state road.
But less than three months were enough for officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structure with the giant billboard.
It's like nobody cares that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-foot safety zone where nothing can happen for safety.
The road crew says they can't handle the billboard because of the puncture-hole law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
"We can't afford that", says Road and Highway Directorate spokeswoman Nina Ledvin, referring to the complex bureaucratic cycle that billboard removal must prevent by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate was followed in detail by the online newspaper Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In the south of the Czech Republic alone, the newsroom counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed illegally just off the road or nearby.
Other countries are in the same situation.
"We have difficulty getting companies to remove the handcuffs", confirms Jiří Klása, head of the transport department of the Czechoslovak Regional Office, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Klass, it's a punitive law that binds officials.
First, they have to go to the owner of the billboard to get the ad removed.
But the bosses of companies are often out of reach or know the trick that Aktuale.cz has described in the past when the issue began to be taken into more detail: just move the mobile ad rack a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black ad in the bin.
That's because the bureau has to pinpoint where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly don't match, it's treated as a new device and we have to call the owner again", explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
A new law could bring about a change that would ban billboards on highways and restrict them on Class I roads as of September next year.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily portable advertising will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Companies can continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of dollars a year from illegal land leases, and no one can access them.
For example, the billboard that appeals to Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czechoslovak Civil Service is currently pursuing three administrative proceedings against her for black-painted billboards.
The company faces a fine of $3,000 in each case.
These are several advertisements which have been placed without authorisation in a Class I road protection zone.
The investigation is not yet complete, says Jaroslav Mraz, head of the transport department of the Czechoslovak Municipality.
The advertisement that Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet among these cases, but will most likely be soon.
According to spokeswoman for the SDC Nina Ledvinová, the company has not responded to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will therefore be brought to the table of the regional and then probably to the magistrates' officers.
Commerz Billboard is one of those shady companies that can't be contacted.
She doesn't take the mail and she canceled her official residence in Žižková over six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to Anton Fischer, a South Bohemian businessman who was famous for his bitter dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has, however, in the past denied any connection.
This spring, when the RSD was interested in advertising Lipno, Fischer had government officials send a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his boarding house, where the company is supposedly based.
Of course, no one has heard from the highway patrol from this address either.
It was a futile fight.
Such silences or opaque changes of residence are not uncommon.
We fined one company two million crowns in a row a few years ago.
But she changed her name and her I.C.O. and there was nothing to do.
The executor returned the case, the ads were still standing, maybe in other places.
We're pretty helpless against similar firms and their business practices.
It's like a windmill fight, confesses one of the officials on condition of anonymity.
No one's solved the legal issue yet.
Currently, we've spoken to several members who are interested in the issue.
But so far, they've developed no activity.
On the contrary, there were members of parliament who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government denied it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for not only national, but also regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know the public demands for them to be limited, and on the other hand, they need them for advertising in their campaigns.
I don't subscribe to the fairly established notion that if something doesn't work, then the law needs to be changed.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more beets and poppies, statistics estimate.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, the crop yield will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's harvest is above the average of the last five to ten years.
The harvest of radishes (3.9%) and poppy (2.5%) will be higher.
The grain harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to the estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as at 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, predicting a decline of 10 percent over last year.
Last year's grain harvest was above average.
This year's harvest is above the average of the last five to ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of beets and poppies will be higher this year.
The beet harvest is 3.9 percent higher than the previous year, when it was 1.256 million tons.
This year's poppy harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due both to a decrease in the hectare yield of 3,7% to 5,71 tonnes per hectare and to a decrease in the area under seed.
Farmers are cutting their fields by three percent this year.
Winter wheat, the most important cereal crop in the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers have planted it in more fields.
However, the decrease will result in a lower yield per hectare, which will fall to 6,04 tonnes.
The statistics suggest that spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer, will fall by about 5%.
The decline in yields is due to a 15.2% reduction in arable land, as well as a lower yield per hectare.
In contrast, winter barley yields are 6.3 percent higher.
Grow the rye crop too.
The rapeseed harvest is estimated by the statistics to be 1,305 million tonnes, an increase compared with last year.
The acreage has expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's canola crop will be 13.3 percent higher than the 10-year average, and the area planted is one third larger than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also been growing.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
The Czech Republic's poppy crop is half that of 2008, when it was grown on a record 70,000 hectares.
The expansion of the planting area will make this year's poppy harvest richer.
It is up by 2.5% compared to last year to 27,423 tonnes.
But the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
The police in Olomouc charged two men with assault with a knife and machete, and the court sent them to custody.
Police have charged two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in central Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, he was inflicted with bladder and cut wounds that required hospital treatment and further treatment", said police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
Both suspects were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion for their arrest, and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in downtown Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The assailants inflicted a puncture wound and a cut, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that occurred at noon on Tuesday in Svoboda Square, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, reported Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Strbak.
The mass brawl between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Trattoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal altercation, two assailants attacked a 35-year-old man with knives and machetes.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was inflicted with a spinal and cutting injury that required hospitalization and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The brawl, which attracted much attention in the city center and prompted the intervention of several police patrols and guards, was a family dispute.
Criminal investigators charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted aggravated assault and disorderly conduct.
The plaintiff filed a motion for their detention and the court granted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was used in a mass fight in the center of Olomouc by the attackers five years ago, it happened only a few dozen meters away, in front of the disco Varna in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about 10 foreigners with weapons attacked guests who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, sticks and machetes.
The court then sentenced the two foreigners to probation.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'd be surprised, you might walk past them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovní náměstí.
This place should have been a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That there's a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
In the centre of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings that, despite their location, size and often even monumental protection, are empty and empty.
We selected properties in the centre using the project Vacation.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that is unable or unwilling to dispose of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax on them, he wants initiative

The Clintons made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
They gave over a million dollars to Clinton's charity.
Most of the Clinton's income -- over $6 million -- is from their speeches.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
The majority of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is from their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the Clintons paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by state and local income taxes of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
Trump has a problem with a similar move, he hasn't decided to release his tax returns yet.
There is a good chance that Donald Trump is not paying any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted minutes after releasing her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump's income, in part to cast doubt on whether her opponent is as wealthy as he claims, the AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower income would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, running in tandem with the former first lady for vice president, today released a report on his tax returns over the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent in taxes last year.
There is a new outbreak of polio in Nigeria.
Boko Haram Islamists have been preventing the systematic vaccination and killing doctors.
There has been a resurgence of polio in Nigeria.
In the northeast, the government declared a vaccination emergency after two children were paralyzed by the disease.
The vaccines were flown there by helicopter.
Boko Haram Islamist terrorists were active in the affected area, preventing vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has been circulating unobserved.
In northeastern Nigeria, an emergency polio vaccination campaign is underway after two children with polio were paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno State and another four million in neighboring states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered polio vaccines to the stricken northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate, according to the AP.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unnoticed in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have opposed vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children with paralysis were found on Thursday.
Both of the disabled children came with refugees from the part of Nigeria that had just been liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, director of the WHO's polio eradication unit, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
The Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has been active in Borno State for a long time.
The area was only made accessible to international organizations and the government earlier this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigeria's health minister, Isaac Adewole, admitted that the new cases of polio are a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria was about to declare polio eradicated next year.
WHO warned that it was possible that although the disease had not been detected for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases worldwide.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan, and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the touching stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a pimp gang thanks to the police.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and encouraged them to look to the future with confidence.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensified fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with 20 former prostitutes who were freed by the police from the power of a pimping gang.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the stirring stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, said a Vatican spokesman.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one each from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
The visit was to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for an intensified fight against it, the pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of those on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April and June this year at his personal invitation.
France will strike the jihadist factories.
But it can't be done without the help of the Muslims.
France has the help of the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing radical changes in the functioning of mosques and the training of clergy.
We've closed 20 mosques and prayer houses since last December.
And more will follow, the Home Secretary announced.
There are over 100 jihadist factories in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in its fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this creed of freedom", declared Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France preach in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, he wants to stop foreign funding for mosques.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money for new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf states.
This, too, is why the mosques are being invaded by preachers who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy", the prime minister added.
The key to ensuring that he achieves these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country is now home to the French Islamic Foundation, which was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, the foundation was supposed to help make financial flows between mosques and the countries that fund their construction more transparent.
But the institution soon became plagued by internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a complete failure", Valls recently stated.
In the wake of the January 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, the debate on a new institution to replace the now-defunct foundation has been raging in the French political scene.
All of this has precipitated further terrorist attacks in France by radicalised Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, was recently told that a new foundation would be established in October.
It will have two main tasks - to provide financing for mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee the imams.
It is not clear where he will get the money to build not only new mosques but also various educational centers.
But there are a number of proposals under consideration.
One is a special tax or tax on halal food.
In practice, they would pay halal food sellers to provide certification.
Some of that money would then go directly into the fund's pocket.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people go there for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, in the future, only preachers who have passed special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
That should ensure that the preaching is consistent with democracy.
We're closing down the radical mosques.
The French government is simultaneously engaged in a campaign against radicals.
And more will follow, the Home Secretary announced recently.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and who do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
It is estimated that there are about 2,500 mosques and prayer halls in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled some 80 imams, and several dozen more are considering it.
Not everyone, however, believes that government action can significantly counter radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do so anyway.
Because it's not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
The trainer Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to the star Bauge.
To advance to the semi-finals, the Czech track cyclist must compete in the repair races.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after advancing from the sprint qualifying round among the top eighteen lost in the first round against French giant Gregory Bauge, the defending silver medalist from the previous Games in London.
He's got to fight for a place in the semi-finals in the repair races.
27 riders stood for the start of the royal discipline on the track and the best Czech racer of the present day scored the fourteenth best time.
He ran the 200-mile run in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination stage, he was the fifth Bauge to qualify, who already has a bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Kelemen was finally able to get a good look at the Frenchman, but he was watching the process.
The gold medalist, Jason Kenny, was a great performer.
The 28-year-old Briton set the third-fastest 200 in history and qualified for the Olympic record 9,551.
As expected, he also easily dealt with the last of the advancing, the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet, with Bradley Wiggins, set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4K race and advanced to the final.
The previous record of 3:51.659, which the British had held four years after the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors pushing for a new lease on life
The representatives of the young doctors have met to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Young Doctors' Council (JDC) has to ask the whole council to support further industry actions from early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the contract issue.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted against the contract they had agreed to with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government remained "silent" on questions, leading to the contract being rejected.
She said: 'In this light, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new treaty altogether and to request a new formal hearing on all issues.'
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the ongoing programme of heated industry events from early September.
The dispute has led the young doctor to call six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the young doctors at the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, has resigned following the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members at pre-voting meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Health Minister said the contract would be a burden on England's medical profession.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of the "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin was welcoming the Turkish counterpart in the lavish hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin didn't smile, and he barely exuded any warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly referred to his dear friend Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the persistent coldness that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was furious.
Putin was throwing punches around and accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The outrage was all the greater that it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild true trust.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has been waging a massive, nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
More serious was the accusation from top state officials that Erdogan's own family was profiting from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it outright.
But an official message came in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he asked President Erdogan for.
Russia could have declared some sort of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear for Ankara.
First of all, Erdogan was almost ousted from power in a failed coup last month, and he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly shaken him as well.
There's also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - most notably the cancellation of charter flights that carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
That number has dropped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly rest here if flights are resumed.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when agricultural imports from Turkey were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", as reported in the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a poor response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing hostility to lengthy EU accession talks and Putin's entry - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from elected officials after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, it's a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as "an alliance of the incompatible": how they join forces with two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite their public demonstration of mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently put itself in the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
You could say that after nearly three hours of opening talks, both presidents said at a press conference that they hadn't even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin chose to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries can find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is to be relegated to the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It was cut short when it nearly went bankrupt eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, the strategy brands used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It's worth millions of pounds spent on international sports sponsorship, from the Six Nations rugby championship to the Winbledon champion Andy Marray.
But now it was decided that it was better to give more prominence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not launch new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except headquarters and stock exchange coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are going to get more into the forefront -- Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
On our trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank".
Because the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have domestically focused efforts.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, and has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"It is an appropriate time for us to move to brand banking because the fundamental question (that we are asking ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers", the CEO said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say we'd become a great customer service bank and introduce those brands.
But with the way we've been focusing on the needs of the customers, rather than our own, I think a lot of things are changing.
We can bring these marks back, I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on the Predilection horse has led to the finish of the 3,000th winner
Dettori sprinkles champagne after his double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori has secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory tonight at his local track - the Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this in the flat races.
His predecessors were Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Triple champion Cheque Dettori, who had previously won on the Ghayyar, said: "It's strange".
I'm very touched because my family is here too
I'm very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot -- it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after the win
Two of this milestone jockeys have achieved success in the hurdles - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led his record-breaking career to more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins in his career
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of modern times, and it's no surprise that he's achieved a milestone that few riders have achieved before.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical pitch that sets him apart from the other riders in the squad.
He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn't been racing on weekends and big races, he'd have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is, Frankie has been a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's something.
He's got a lively temperament, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous aerial jump
From the sprint finishers to the long jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the British flat racing messenger for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
A record number of major race wins, including his famous Grand Slam at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from the start because of drugs.
He first stagnated three years ago when he returned after a six-month ban from the start, but he showed incredible inner strength and despite all the doubters he returned in top form.
And this may not be the last time - Dettori has said before that he would like to continue racing until at least 50.
Russian President Putin fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov from his post as chief of staff on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
63-year-old Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had fired Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential office, without giving a reason.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vajno was a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website states (in Russian) that he later served as the Chief of Presidential Protocol and Presidential Office.
At the time of his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust".
I believe the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and checking the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to step down and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will it convince smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates and like Putin worked for the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both men said they were resigning as chief of staff at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras have convinced few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man once thought to be a possible president suddenly desires to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with great suspicion.
The Kremlin website quotes comments to Putin in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult, even problematic, post for four years.
Apparently, I was chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov might succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the TV series Criminal Minds, was released after he hit the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produced the series, issued a joint statement announcing his release.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences on stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry this happened", he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the show, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are to be released later.
The 54-year-old actor, best known for his starring roles in the sitcoms Dharma and Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and for the past 12 years I've put my heart and soul into it", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it till the end, but that's not gonna happen now.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team and most of all, the amazing fans this show could have hoped for.
The series is expected to return for a twelfth series on September 28.
In Banff City , fish mysteriously landed in a garden .
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying fish that had appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels left by the water shrinkage.
Bain, who lives about 500 yards [500 m] from the sea, posted a short video of his find on Periscope, hoping that someone might help him explain how the five-centimeter-long fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern platform to the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects to Fife.
It is the first of four locks among the Skyway platforms that are now almost complete around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspended ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of the Treasury Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we all witnessed how the civil engineers used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this section of the bridge, on a truly impressive scale.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the enclosure between the viaduct and the bridge deck was a delicate operation that required extreme precision.
In place now is a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now being poured in Rosytha, so the whole platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure of any bridge is always an important milestone.
In this amazing project, this enclosure represents the pinnacle of earthworks.
After installing the last section of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - toward the mainland.
We did this by stretching the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and had to be towed at a rate of about 3% ascent.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: three men are lucky to be alive
Three men are lucky to be alive after being washed out of their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre lifeboat station RNLI issued an alert at 13:20 UK time on Friday after the crew saw an incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling nearby and thought the worst", said the pilot of the lifeboat Moelfre, Vince Jones.
"A strong wind has fortunately blown it away from them before we could sail", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, the third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket, exhausted, holding buoys.
All were transferred aboard the coastal lifeboat and transferred back to the lifeboat station
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the overturn occurred.
Someone upstairs was holding a protective hand over those boys.
The judge refuses to hear a case because of Bastard's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who were allegedly given political traffic by Prime Minister Nečas and his then-head of the cabinet Jana Nagy, i.e. a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was about the approval of the tax package.
Schneider, Fuchs and Bastard made it possible by their resignations.
Then they appeared in high-profile positions in state-owned companies.
They also faced bribery charges and ended up in jail for a month.
According to the court, they were wrongfully convicted, and they were awarded damages totaling almost 2 million crowns.
The deaf man is now a witness in the case, after the Supreme Court intervened.
His wife works at the courthouse at the Fruit Market, dealing with civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be handled by another Prague district court.
The Queen has already pardoned Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová, twice.
It was an alleged use of military intelligence to spy on Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
In this case, the Deaf Man was not a character.
But according to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, it's an unnecessary overreaction.
I don't think that impartiality can be interpreted in such a way that a court is excluded if a witness has a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid that would make it impossible to judge anything at all, he noted for the diary.
"It seems fleeting", he added.
In the political trafficking case, Roman Bocek, a former civil servant, is also accused.
But his lawyer, Peter Tomana, says that any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the Prague 1 District Court heard the indictment of former Prime Minister's chief of staff Petra Nečas Jany Nagyová (now Nečasová) and other defendants in the case of misuse of Military Intelligence.
This is a picture of Nevers and her husband coming to court.
The fat lady was supposed to handle the statements about Peroutk.
The wife of the exposé, for example, was to judge the statements of President Milos Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutko.
Zeman said he was a sympathizer of Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was probably killed in an Allied air raid.
She flew to Syria with two friends of her own age from London Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Home Office has not commented on the report of her death.
Young Londoners who had run away from home were smuggled into Syria across the Turkish border, police said.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are reportedly heading to London to meet their other former classmate from Bethnal Green Academy.
The case caused a huge wave of attention last year and also strained relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that some 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them have joined the radicals of ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand.
A high-paying job that doesn't even require a college degree.
That's what the job of an idiot looks like.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only the extremely high salary (in Prague you can earn up to CZK 180 000 working in IT), but also the extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
It is estimated that there is a shortage of almost 20 000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
The most sought-after, according to Grafton's personnel statistics, are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from a number of job offers.
So it is not the job candidates who are competing for the job, but the job positions for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
College education is not a requirement for aunt and uncle.
Higher education is a good foundation and an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and educational ability, but often has little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which is not something that a university degree can replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He makes the most money in Prague.
The salaries of the A-Team are everywhere above the Republican average.
The biggest money comes from Prague and Brno, the regions are not so successful.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague", confirms Kubačka.
CTOs are the highest paid.
In Prague and Brno they can get 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also interviewed.
They can earn between CZK 60,000 and CZK 100,000 when they start.
It's about graduates, too.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case in the professions of the unskilled.
Because if companies are going to go out and overpay a specialist from another company, they're going to go for a graduate.
They can raise him any way they want.
They can't do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession, but for the unskilled, a minimum of good English is essential.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a requirement for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a lot of cases where companies are looking for a person with a high level of education and experience, and are satisfied with only an average level of English.
But if a support worker, for example, speaks more than one foreign language, he is of interest to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the director of Kubačka adds.
Yo, Google, there is paradise.
Only the Czech workers can be silently jealous of the employees at Google.
Flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various reduced hours are a matter of course, not just for mothers.
"New dads are given an extra four weeks of leave by society after the birth of their baby", says Martina Jonek, a spokeswoman for Google.
Petting also includes healthcare for employees and their families, nutrition, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
If you want to learn, you have a green light, and it doesn't matter what you want to learn.
But that's not the end of the benefits.
A free fridge like that is definitely not for the faint of heart.
A healthy lunch (including breakfast and dinner in some locations) is available on site every day.
In addition, all offices have so-called micro-kitchens, where people can always find a healthy snack, the spokesman reveals.
And to make sure nothing gets thrown away, he puts what he doesn't eat in boxes that employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these incredible advantages for the Czech people?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it's not about employees sitting in the office for eight hours a day, but about the results of initiatives or projects, the shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions", the spokesperson adds.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law", Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He warned that "it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for criminal armed militants who brazenly organize refugee chases on the Bulgarian-Turkish border".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested", Zeid stressed.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that under international law everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, 21,000 during the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - A Pursuit of Health and Happiness That Pays
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Many people have lamented over the past decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outside and prefer to spend their leisure time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people up from their couches and leads them to activity.
Screen time has been reduced to television, video games, and, more recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm talking, of course, about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, the character-based application that first appeared in video games in the late '90s (later animated series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the game before the launch of the new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then delayed due to the huge interest which led to server overload.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, gamers on smartphones go out to look for Pokémon that they're tracking with GPS, and when they find them, they can take a picture of them or capture them.
The mania has taken over a generation that's played the game at a younger age, lifted it out of its seats and driven it out to look for Pokémon.
In the United States, the game has led to a dramatic increase in the number of steps the "average" person takes each day.
Apple's Cardiogram smartwatch app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people who watched the game and exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - they only see rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to get people to "get 30", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen to the ground, because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don't look good.
Still, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You're covering the three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air, sunshine.
Some people even make new friends by chasing Pokémon.
Of course, there are those boring patrons who look for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk through the door.
What, like?
It was a breakthrough.
In the past, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do something like this game.
The news is seen and at some point the interest in it begins to wane.
But with the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people in their pursuit of activity, health and fitness.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's gymnastics all-around
Forget about the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the scaffold.
All the people are dumb.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in the high jump on Thursday, beating the rest in a full line under the Olympic lights.
Her total score of 62.198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and final five member Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the podium in the final of the individual all-around gymnastics competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the mixed doubles, and fifth overall, as she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best of all time.
When her final score was on the board and her long journey to this moment was over, tears came to her face.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the rare athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning builds are a blend of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen".
The final test was in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racing team, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything but returning home to my family in Spring, Texas, with my hands full of gold medals, would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver medals in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won her first on Tuesday, when she was the cheerleader at the celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which isn't entirely true.
Part of her solo composition - the one that includes her signature triple double-turn-salto - is set to Latin music that would fit right in the house, on the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
She was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
She hasn't lost a match in the series since the summer of 2013 - a winning streak that can go on as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time with two laps, it was an illusion.
The betting and the straight - where Biles is defending the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the top with 15,433 points per bet and finished with 15,933 points in singles.
Raisman held her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering shadows of red, white and blue, Biles' tears came as a wish she had once written in her diary as a child was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafina, but she won bronze for the best three-way combination.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "babysit", was way ahead.
She sent her free men a crowd of airy kisses, overwhelmed by a return that at times seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post, which the 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in the most significant attack in a decade, the first serial killer in Phoenix, when they were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report said the gunman stood beside the passenger and fired eight rounds from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the triple homicide was not robbery because the assailant did not take the wallet or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims had on him.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators are looking into whether the shooting was connected to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks occurred in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
"It's happening in the mansion district in front of the houses", Howard told KPHO's CBS affiliate earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late '90s, a black BMW from the late '90s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks are related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting that targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple homicide, which police believe was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found the cartridges and made a bullet out of the bullet residue in the seat and under the hood.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: He is improving
Edmund Piccotto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first thing I thought was I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - clearly you are ready for it, she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people don't do this anymore", explains Picciut.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still can't speak.
But it's already filling some of the milestones.
He walks with a helper and rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth performs the sign language that Edmund uses to say "Please sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not common sign language - it says that Edmund invented some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different conditions: genetic, as in Edmund's case, and infections in pregnancy caused by viruses, such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary substantially.
It's too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut resembles the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I keep asking myself, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
I never actually asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children suffering from the birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
You know it's gonna get better.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and flooding have prompted rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme rainfall, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are spilling out of their banks and threatening widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they're getting requests for watercraft, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone requested 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood watch will remain in place in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that it could rain another 8 to 13 centimeters above sea level.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was on alert Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are forecast to peak this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood a number of homes in the Baton Rouge suburbs.
He also noted that the danger is that the Ascension County stream will flood, and the floodwaters will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on record at 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescue crews are still pulling people out of the tidal waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday at Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming", said Hansford.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's seen on the river in 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family members are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and took them to the Gloucester Fire Station, where they were kept under cover on Friday.
Krautmann said that as the heavy rains continue, the flooding is spreading rapidly and authorities are considering evacuation.
Krautmann said an observer near Liviston reported 35 centimeters of rainfall between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil is heavily soaked from the center.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips had forced residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and schooling in five school districts to be canceled.
The WWL affiliate of CBS reported that according to the Tangipahoa elder, 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in the high water.
Shelters were set up in Amite and Hammond for those evacuated.
"They'll be able to return home when the water starts to fall", he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding, and local residents were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from flooding.
"The last major flooding we had here was in March", said city manager Lacy Landrum.
It looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said that the continuing rains along the Gulf Coast are continuing.
He said that a few homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but by Friday, none of them were in the report.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen it before", said Townson, "and it's still there".
Mahaj Brown (6) - "The boy who was shot in the back, survived the Philadelphia shooting"
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's parents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
Parents say the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including fractures, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He was taking too much, his little body was spread like a bullet", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station the boy should be fine.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, and according to CBS Philadelphia, two other victims are in stable condition.
According to the station's report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the vehicle, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was a possible shooting between several armed men.
The shells of assault weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found at the scene.
From all the evidence, it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shells on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears there were several armed combatants who were actively involved, Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly reviewing the security footage.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday outside a home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I envision the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympics, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been more dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud to be part of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish descent, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
It also cemented the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast in the last four years has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who displayed unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're seeing the pinnacle of sports, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics classes in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie went to the Olympic team the same way Aly and Madison did.
They are the "final five" because the gymnastics team for the next Olympics will be made up of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
The reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnasts train mostly at private gymnastics clubs, maintained by parents who pay for training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their mentors and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
These clubs provide gymnasts with all the training they need, and for the families of gymnasts, this is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached athletes at the time they started gymnastics.
It's our duty to make gymnastics training more accessible and accessible to the communities of the countless young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 young people within the city (mostly black and Hispanic) and we've trained national and international champions.
In September, we're expanding to Detroit, my hometown, where we're providing quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, achievement at school and at work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send us thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing your girl strength and winning Olympic team gold, and thank you for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to embark on the journey of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected, the young doctors are ready to strike again.
Ministers hoped that a revised contract with the British Medical Association (BMA) would end disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans in July to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in no man's land and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract which includes changes to the night and weekend working procedures to improve care during non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Young Doctors Commission, said in a statement last night: 'Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that it will increase the current labour crisis and thus fair treatment for all doctors.'
With only eight weeks to go before the first batch of doctors are signed to the new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with reluctance to involve Dr. and often deafening silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for enforcement and resolve the fears of young doctors.
If that doesn't happen, then the young doctors are ready to take the next step.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
The Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements on the changes would be resolved.
The BMA wants higher weekend pay for the 54,000 young doctors who would be contracted.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS Employers' Council, has urged young doctors not to take part in any strikes.
Mortimer said: "Work-to-do will achieve little or nothing, but it will put pressure on already overburdened teams and services and increase anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families".
Over the past two months, we've been working with the Young Doctors Council and working with the Ministry of Health and others to respond positively to their concerns about the role of oversight and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health are taking the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A $60 a day medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs about $1.50 (U.S.), and authorities recommend that it be given to more patients over a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a recurrence of a heart attack in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or heart attack.
Strokes and heart attacks are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is removed, blood clots can form, blocking the blood supply to the heart, and causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain, and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE directive, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Evaluation, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences".
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - in particular on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With the computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas.
The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to the overlooking of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, a government report says today.
Former Prime Minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticised the police, election inspectors and city councils for ignoring voter abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary, now the head of the anti-corruption task force, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that police should put cordonings on polling stations and protect alert voters.
He recommended that voters carry their identity card with them so they could prove who they are in the election.
At present, voters simply enter their name and address.
The report also proposes that indelible ink be applied to the fingers of voters when they cast their ballots to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for greater access for the press to the documents of the meetings and to the decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"It is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also protecting local government from the broader corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand", he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had cynically attacked the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said he had run his campaign in such a way that it was a religious obligation for devout Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes have been contested or as a result of identity theft, where a person votes and impersonates someone else.
Sir Eric has stated that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern over mail-in voting fraud - allegedly where senior members of the Muslim community pressured people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting ID
His report states: 'Evidence has been presented of the pressure exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, particularly in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.'
There were concerns that... state institutions were turning a blind eye to such behavior because of their "politically correct" oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes, thus preventing 'vote-ripping'.
The report, which is now being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more rigorous checks on registration to prevent the use of electoral rolls for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to show proof of identity before voting.
Using indelible ink on the fingers of voters to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carrying out systematic nationality checks of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Limit requests for automatic correspondence voting to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating correspondence ballots and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to cordon off polling stations.
Amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who exert unlawful pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibiting the taking of photographs in polling stations.
Require that only Englishmen (with the exception of Wales) work in polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that staff comply with the rule that voters go to polling stations individually.
Sir Eric is critical of the London police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Election Commission has expelled Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices", he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt - on the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticises the ineffective check-out of check-in boxes in the voter registration departments at the town hall.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's judgment in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities are threatening that reputation.
Crazy about Duchess Kate's cycling doppelganger and other famous doppelgangers at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete vying for gold this year to boast her own celebrity double - at least not according to social media.
In celebration of the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities who are currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL's women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
Hunted: U.S. archer Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Alongside Kate's twin at the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer might be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
American archer Brady Ellison has caused a Twitter stir after images surfaced of him strikingly resembling a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he'd heard about his resemblance to Leo since he was a little boy.
"They don't see much of a resemblance to themselves, except for maybe a beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I think it's a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be further highlighted this year: the striking similarity between British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And if you look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell star Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change, the user thinks that Nathan is the athletic version of the actor from Inception.
Another long-standing comparison is that of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova not only boasts the same skin and blonde hair as Annalyn McCord, but also the look of Nathan Adrian of Team USA, whom fans say is an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levit.
The women in question: soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial and eye shapes
Not just one: A Twitter user was very pleased that the similarities had been noticed by others.
Theory on the waves: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similar look of the couples
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the page that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
Soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings with a smile that is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, boasting of her beautifully wide smile, which is almost like a copy of the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo, girls!
CBC's Olympic commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer "exploded"
Viewers of the CBC's live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday were outraged by a performance analysis by 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald, who finished fourth in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay.
Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "dragged like a stink" during the race and "exploded".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to utter his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "revival" to the CBC commentary team, said, among other things, "That little 14-year-old girl from China gave up, you bastard".
Too much excitement, she was dragging like a stink, she exploded.
Thank you, man.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in a time of 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to overtake China.
The Canadian audience quickly began to comment online, appalled by the tone and language the commenter used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC announcer claim that a 14-year-old swimmer from China exploded?"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay was described as:  The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you bastard.
Byron MacDonald's Twitter criticism came from all sides, and many have called for his removal.
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists. #disgust.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said: "We apologize for the comment about the swimmer's performance that was leaked on the air".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and pasted their apology into a response to over 90 Twitter users complaining about commenter MacDonald's comments.
The station also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
He sincerely regrets that those words were spoken, that they should not have been aired.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television, trying to explain his remark by saying he didn't want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay", he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
I meant the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such.
Needless to say, I didn't mean any disrespect and I'm very sorry.
Customers at Primark upset by a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
When a woman undressed to try on her panties at the mall in the middle of Primark, shoppers weren't sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit herself, took off her pants, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to search, and finally tried on four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before she put them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, said the mysterious woman "re-dressed" after trying on her underwear and left the store without buying anything.
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes".
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own stockings and panties, and put them on.
She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, cocky like a monkey.
Everyone was just watching her take her pants off again, and she obviously didn't like them, because she put them back on the shelf.
She did the same with three others, until finally deciding she didn't like it, she put on her clothes again and left.
She seemed to care not who was looking - not to think of the man who might buy the pants she was trying.
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "The idea of someone taking home underpants that someone else was wearing and nobody had cleaned them, that's disgusting".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "When she left, I collected the items she had obviously tried to take off the sale - which is also the only correct thing to do".
I would be terrified to bring home new pants and find out that another woman had them on, had them taken off, and they hadn't been washed.
A Primark store spokesman said: "Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th".
All the products concerned were withdrawn.
How to Defend Against a Gun Attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be a little bit safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, Grand Master of the New York-based Krav Mag Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video shows you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over a bully, whether he's approaching from the front or from behind.
If he comes at you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and have a clear shot.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then the knee goes into the groin, and while the attacker is curled up in pain, you twist the weapon from his hand, hit him head-on in the face, and start to retreat, keeping the weapon pointed at him.
If an armed man approaches from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, force the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip and begin to retreat, still aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video where you can see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of a heist - unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to spend all the cash.
Ian Wright traveler licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
A British traveler decided to put his immune system and reflexes to the test - by licking the dirtiest and most distasteful places in Europe.
Suffolk-based travel writer and presenter Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railway railing at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet seat on a train and a Russian pay phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment that inspired the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, yielded interesting results.
The idea of licking the washer button on a train that thousands of other people have used may seem completely repulsive, but the kitchen sink is actually far more harmful than the sink.
Throughout his travels in Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about boosting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything worse than a smell in his mouth.
Ian Wright became famous for testing his guts on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system - from public railway rails to a flush toilet.
In the film he made about it, he says: "Since I was a child, I didn't care much about my health and put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms to muddy water".
He certainly made his reputation in the film.
The only thing he turned down were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple scan, the luminometer showed a value of over 4,000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy company Valio have made a traveler's video called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "That's almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in a bathroom".
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
Mr. Wright was given Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Food, Juice and New Categories at Valio, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would watch them with enthusiasm and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a bunch of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian".
It's been said that concern about gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context -- good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it's connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film".
Some things were naturally easier for Ian to lick, others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we filmed licking some of that dirty stuff.
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 which found that 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health and 58% of respondents said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.
A family of social workers demolishes a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A family of social workers left £50,000 in damage to their townhouse after being accused of terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, following a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction, the housing association officials were shocked to find that the property was in a state of disrepair.
Holes in the walls, the floor covering torn, garbage pouring all over the floor, and the walls scrubbed.
The family has already moved and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house would be saved.
She said, "It's been a nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a number of circumstances to consider, as this property is likely to become known as "not so nice part of Cornwall".
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who occasionally stayed at the house, and police said the family's reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, drug use, distribution of drugs and loud shouting, arguments, and abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given a sentence in June for anti-social behaviour.
Smelly trash was found in several rooms of the house that may be demolished.
The house where the drugs were distributed in the past had the floor cover torn out
Neighbors say they saw them on the street, fighting, and regularly people called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of their home this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors greeted the eviction with the words that their lives were living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
We've seen the police here so many times, we can't even count them.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was incredibly quiet - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice to finally have them gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the manager of Cornwall Housing's Neighborhood Oversight, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called to the police
Trash and old toys were lying around in the overgrown part of the town hall
He adds: It is a shame that the tenant has failed to accept responsibility for her own behaviour and that of her family.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions must have frightened her neighbors, according to the witness.
I appreciate all the work that my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the local community members have done to bravely inform us.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors while also sending a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three of the tenant's sons who lived in the house at different times were in their early 20s.
A dirty mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Workers will now have to remove piles of garbage that have been left around the house
In 2014, she raided the shelves of the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon got a ticket when she was found guilty of possessing class B drugs she was trying to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth after being evicted.
Graffiti was painted on the walls of many rooms of the house.
Police say they'll seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow from Denv and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who will continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow such behaviour", she said.
Denny and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and unsocial behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after a military jet crashes over a beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun's rays in Aveiro, Portugal, were terrified to death
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion was flying at an incredibly low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and insisted there was no security risk.
As the jet plunged low over the crowded beach, panic seized the terrified tourists.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane getting within reach of sun-drenched people on a sandy beach near Aveiro, in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationalists who posted video footage of the dramatic flight on social media, said: "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash".
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to fly low because it was the only way to check the vessel.
The plane was reportedly flying slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility from smoke from nearby forest fires, but the aviation authority insists that the safety of the passengers was not at risk.
Forest fires this summer devastated parts of mainland Portugal, claiming four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing the view
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half the funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half the funeral directors are not compliant.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČOI) found this out during its checks in the second quarter.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a legal basis for the application of the measure.
COL imposed 41 fines totaling about $1,000.
This was reported today by her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich.
The inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and in one case the seller used an unofficially verified meter.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
This concerned urn packaging, candlestick covers and vases which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Since there are still breaches of the law in this specific area of services, the controls will continue in the next quarter of this year", Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It's been reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Syria's Rakka several weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed in a Russian airstrike in Rakka, a stronghold of the group in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going into a war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making a decision", said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London school girls boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family found out she had married an IS fighter in Syria and within months she was widowed.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she'll keep Garland as the Supreme Court nominee.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person to replace the late Supreme Court justice will be chosen by the next president.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believes Clinton will pick Garland with a certain degree of credibility.
Reid's spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether to nominate Garland, and that he was only speculating.
He rated Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to have to choose anyone else to screw up the ship.
Garland is the chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "servants" and "swings" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit to be in office.
According to Treats magazine, there are nude calendars for both women and men.
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellamer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of exposing celebrities, she's trying to find the next generation of top models for her 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for women.
He obviously thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to return to the timeless and classic depiction of nudity, where women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar's release.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their photos online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really buys records?
Vinyl is a favorite of lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to fill the comments section with pepper notes under the pseudonym Not All Lonely Men in the Middle Ages, we would like to point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is not linked to the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of owning a physical object, but to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not even about building a fan base -- it's all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV report, a camera would watch me as I walk out onto a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing widely, then I would stop, reach out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's see".
Let's take a look at this.
While the charm and charm of Soho's heart is slowly fading - the buildings once occupied by independent dealers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and canteens, clothing and office supplies - a few fantastic specialty record shops remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'd stand in close proximity to the various men in these stores and try to observe their age and emotional moods.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman in her 20s) has an appointment in London this afternoon and is going through the shops to fill in a few hours.
I ask him if he's a collector.
"I think so", he says.
I have about three or four thousand records.
All those tapes are lining the walls of his living room -- in the picture above (he e-mailed me the photo, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles is also because he can afford it: he can now buy records that he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he can buy back what he sold when he was young and didn't have a windmill.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, and it's stuff that would have been published when I was 11 or 12, when I was too young to buy it", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts, who like to be with themselves, adding: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks a lot of the customers she meets fit into her YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people influenced by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.
According to my interviews, the most frequent time people disposed of their collections was between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their gramophone records back, he says.
That might explain the boom in record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of phonograph records?
It doesn't take you more than a few seconds to find in a store like Phonica that you can find in music stores a pleasant community of like-minded people.
According to Weza, some older customers are particularly displeased by the contactless payment system.
Some phonograph enthusiasts may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and have chosen the familiar surroundings of phonograph packaging, things that evoke memories of quiet adolescence.
"I think that filling a gap or owning something material can bring a certain comfort", says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people are.
It's an easy way to fill a space in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" echoes a coworker from the stack of phonograph records.
An ICM survey in April found that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have phonographs that they never use, while 7% of those who buy phonograph records do not have a phonograph.
At this point in the report, he probably looked seriously disturbed as he went through a bunch of bossa nova compilations.
The trophy aspect and the revival of interest is something Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, noticed.
"Someone came in the other day and said, 'I don't have a phonograph yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
The percentage of those is not great, but it happens.
It's more about the product page than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a phonograph".
It's younger people, not older, grown-up teenagers, who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is now dedicated to phonograph discs, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops used to be - the speakers are filled with the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex instead of jazzy drag - it's good to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly isolated, but the penetrating psychological trauma is hard to gauge when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, walks for a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various discount recordings.
She's one of those people who'd rather look at shelves than spend it feverishly.
She says she doesn't make much money, so it's not like she'd be a record collector.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the record has a magic...
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the store that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in girls' jeans-tipped calves and I watch a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroids, and then a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramophone.
On the left is a staircase, the walls of which are covered with gramophone records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average gramophone collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are so high up on the wall that they are out of reach.
It's a pure vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It's no surprise that the demographic where there's probably more time and money than in other areas is also where the most money is spent on the most luxurious goods, which vinyl is certainly.
But while my findings seem to be accurate -- at least in record stores -- they don't take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and fans that actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in schools or offices.
They certainly don't spend Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record shops, looking through recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest average life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female, estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old, measuring five meters
A French court refused to demolish shops in a jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected an order from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to close a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents in temporary restaurants or basic meals for a few euros.
The office of the prefect of Calais argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not provide additional food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Disputed convenience stores and restaurants often provide free shelter and food to people in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 temporary shops, but said that the objections of the prefect of Calais were 'completely understandable'.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people living in extremely desperate conditions.
He said the premises provide quiet places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
The petition to protect the Children's Café has been signed by over 170,000 people.
The Guardian has received a letter saying that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
Aid organizations Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp increase in arrivals during the summer rose to more than 9,000 - the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
The street is raising itself and the volleyball mouth.
"I've been able to train normally since March", he reported to the start of summer training in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a double pulmonary embolism, and then I had heart problems because of it.
Because when I was at university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So, the long flight to Asia was a problem?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
I was in pain, nobody found anything.
Then the clot came up.
There's a vein in the calf that's damaged, and it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when you're working or the weather's changing.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He should have.
Last year at the summer tournament in the Woodlands, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move at all.
I threw up blood last night.
The doctors told me it was something else entirely, I was five days out of my system.
I really thought I was dead in the Woods, and my friend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I've had to live through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I need to be more careful when I fly.
But there's nothing you can do about it.
Only when I tried to get back to Prep last year, I had a heart problem.
It's all right now.
Since March, I've been training myself at home to be able to play again.
I'm gonna knock it off. I'm better physically than I was before.
What do you expect from the Mouth?
I'm looking forward to it. The crew looks good. I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
I hope we sit down humanly so we can get along.
Can you get the Mouth?
It had a reputation for being a hit, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it's second.
There's a new team in the Bay, only a few players left.
It was in the last extraction, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first few rounds who's the winner, I don't think we are.
Is coach Brom the guarantee of success?
He's experienced and he's been through a lot, he'll think of something better than last place.
But my coming had nothing to do with it. I arranged it first.
There were other coaches in the game, one of whom I'm a good friend of, and it was agreed that he would be here.
I won't say the name.
Mr. Brom finally came along, and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been coaching for decades, he's a former good player.
He's going to move us up.
What can I get you?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke, and I like to get a chance on a not-so-top team.
I was in the Pribrams for two years, but the Mouth is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right away, because it starts at the bottom.
You mentioned the foreigners, the Australian Boehm is already training in the Mouth.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in college.
And we've had a few conversations there, sometimes we've sat together after a game, so we're friends now.
We beat them 3-1, I immediately poured it on him at the start of summer training in the Mouth.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, she's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze are coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been texting an American, he seems like a nice guy, Brazilian who knows how he'll speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so I'm the one who creates, so I should be able to communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out who the player was, found him on the Internet, watched some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We've been posting on Facebook, he's been acting like a joke, he's gonna fit in.
How are you enjoying your position as recording number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only 24 and I'm not in the mood to take turns.
I'd rather be in the middle of it, I'd rather lead the team than have someone else lead it.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I was gonna be a backup recording artist and do it full time, because if you don't do something full time, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in the suburbs, when Kust wasn't doing as well as a captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems, and he left.
We've been climbing up since then, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I was raised, I took turns with one and two.
It was a great year in Old Town, and after that I had a lot of offers, and I picked the Preparatory.
That's where the Buddies wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains Phelps' domain.
"To be on the podium again and hear the anthem is sweet as ever", Phelps laughed, his eyes again full of tears.
His fiancée and mother were once again cheering in the audience, this time Boomer's son sleeping peacefully with headphones on.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy -- I started competitive swimming 20 years ago, and in a few hours it'll be over, he said, touched.
In the final, Phelps was almost two seconds behind silver-medal winner Kosuke Hagino of Japan, who won the long jump.
The bronze was won by Wang Shun of China, the bronze medalist in this discipline at last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four consecutive games.
For most of the race, Phelps and the other American, Ryan Lochte, and the local, Thiago Perreira, held the lead.
While the defending gold medalists in the final relay fifty set a stunning finish, they fell short of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremony, he advanced to the finals of the 100-meter butterfly.
The legend could not be overshadowed by his countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the landmark double - after a hundred wins in Rio and a double track.
In the final, he was beaten by 37-century Australian Mitchell Larkin, and finished third by Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While Murphy's only fifth place finish in the 200 at last year's world championships, he's become the king of the 200 in Rio.
He knocked off the imaginary throne Larkin, who had just done the same double at last year's World Championships.
But he won a medal at the Olympics just now.
The gold in the 100m breaststroke was shared by Penny Oleksiak of Canada and Simone Manuel of the United States.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was her fourth medal at these Games, and for Manuel, her second, after silver in the relay.
She won the gold medal at OH as the first African-American swimmer in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
"This medal is for all those who come after me, for them sport will become love and they will get to where I am", said Manuel, moved.
Third was Sarah Sjöström, a Swede who won the world record in the 100-meter butterfly in Rio and also has a silver in the 200-yard butterfly.
It was the sixth time that the world record holder, Australian Cate Campbell, finished.
Japan's Rie Kaneto won the 200 breaststroke, her first Olympic medal in 27 years.
She has no precious metal from the World Championships, her best finish being fourth in the discipline in 2013.
The second silver medal in Rio was won by Russia's Yulia Jefimova, who despite a doping history, is facing hostility from spectators and competitors for her Olympic debut.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the case, and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
"I'm so tired of this", said the Russian swimmer.
She won the right to start in Rio before the CAS Special Panel on Arbitration for Sport just before the start of the Games.
They took my appeal and I won.
"If anyone likes it or dislikes it, or if they have a different opinion, they can go to arbitration", she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And the midnight run?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
They didn't know who they were going up against until less than an hour before the game.
They must have mastered tactical preparation in no time.
And then, in an unconventional time, they started a game on small court number one.
They didn't start well in the first set, then they got ahead of the competition, but they couldn't make it to the finish line at 19:19.
In the second, they were clearly better and tied, but the decisive tie-break didn't work out.
First of all, a series of broken serves meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians", Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the match?
After a bad start, before I could play, we got into the game.
In the end, I missed the income I was used to in the last balloon.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
We went for it in the next set with a field goal, a different defense, and we pushed for the serve.
There was a really bad pitch at the tie-break, and we took this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
Too bad we missed the start of the first set.
We were able to download it, but we were missing the dots.
The second set was great, and the third set was the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and that's where we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How was your little playground number one?
Like in China, in the backyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock in the morning, it was completely quiet, no music, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose those conditions, but we can't choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
She was weird.
We started training for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon has prepared his tactics for almost every possibility out there.
He had a lot of tactical paperwork ready, so we were pretty well prepared on this side.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
I guess not.
We played at half past eleven, but not at twelve.
Russian Birlov's block in the pre-play-off at OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug at the run-off of the play-offs at OH in Rio.
Was that awkward?
By playing the last two games in the group of ten, we had the regime shifted earlier.
That was two hours too long.
It's strange, I can't imagine any other sport has athletes who have to put in their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we prepared as best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not exactly typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Since the group's progress was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said we'd do.
But now I'm sad after the game.
I'll sleep on it and from tomorrow on I'll remember the Olympic tournament in a positive way.
Big Brother is here, coming up on the first surveillance SIM.
You can't escape it.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from one of the local operators while in Thailand.
Not only tourists, but also people with long-term visas who work in Thailand or who have married there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, has informed that there will be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures to track their location within six months.
Tantasith believes that this is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow to solve the crime committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect persons who exceed the authorised length of stay.
In addition to the SIMs intended exclusively for Thais, special SIMs for foreigners should be available to retailers within six months.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently enabled on cards intended for people without Thai passports.
It won't be able to be turned off.
"This SIM feature is not for Thais because we can always easily track them", Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators had been giving out free launch cards to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The same measure as Thailand is also being considered by ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia and Singapore.
The Commission also considers that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
The proposed measure does not, however, impose an obligation on foreigners to obtain a local operator's SIM card upon entry into the country.
They can of course use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country concerned only know the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM has been connected to their network.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference between roaming prices and local operators' rates is so abysmal that even most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to control the movement of foreigners were immediately criticized by foreigners living legally in Thailand.
Tantasith reassures the situation and compares the proposed system to the obligation to provide a residence address on immigration documents in the context of privacy protection.
In addition, the police will need a court order to track a specific person.
Any misuse of the system will be punished indefinitely.
"If the service provider tracks the SIM location without a warrant, it will be charged with a criminal offence", Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While currently a specific number will only be recycled after the 90 day deadline for the SIM not to be connected to the network, once again, a number could be renewed after 15 days if it leaves Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrade with a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose a new apartment?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where the landlord would provide most of the care.
The condition was that there was enough parking space and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with the flooring swinging, high energy consumption and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building was unable to offer.
You can find more interesting visits in Modern Apartment magazine.
The interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Kamilla Poláková from Artiga.
Why did you call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend working with an architect to anyone who designs an apartment from scratch, because it's a very complex technical process.
The second level is interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to tailor the interior according to the client's wishes.
We had already worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, then based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us when we reconstructed our new apartment in Vinohrade.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, conceived as modern but not cold interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment to the terraces and to implement intelligent household control.
And of course, the quality of the execution had to be monitored.
Did you leave it to the experts, or did you intervene in the final design of the interior?
All the designs, including the technical drawings and the samples of the materials, were approved, but the design always came from the architects.
We started by defining what we wanted to do with the design, and then we showed some of the interior elements that we wanted to incorporate into the design, like carpets or paintings.
I think that it is our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Špály or Otto Gutfreund that has helped orientate our taste in architecture.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut was the architect's idea, as were the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then worked together to see if everything fit together using visualization.
Were there any complications in the implementation that forced you to abandon your original ideas or to adopt new ones?
Maybe only in the early stages of the project, when we came to the building, at the moment when it was possible to go up to the height of our floor for the first time, and we realized that the views that we had planned were actually overshadowing the surrounding buildings.
We changed the mood literally overnight from the ground up.
Granite was used for the kitchen line and the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces with leather, for example, on the upholstery of dining and bar chairs Norma by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes or is there anything you wish you could do differently today?
I think it's a modern airy interior that's above all serving its purpose.
We're not planning any changes. Most of the post-migration adjustments have been to the shade and terrace level.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when the nut wood appears too delicate for a dog house.
The architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA Kamila Hornych, are the authors of the project.
The apartment is on the top floor of the new building, so it was possible to implement completely new layout solutions and several other modifications during the construction.
An important element of the interior is the placement of lighting fixtures in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilets.
It's what got daylight into the darker parts of the apartment.
Also, the direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the swimming pool by the USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial to the function of the whole apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and a hot tub.
"You're not negative compared to the French", says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I've moved around a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led to a job at a magazine.
Why did you decide to leave the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere among the people.
I found every Frenchman to be very negative.
People in France are generally in a negative mood, but lately it's gotten worse.
That's interesting you mentioning negativity.
That's how some people judge the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France, because as tourists they do not perceive it as much.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is the need for money.
People feel that they have little money, whereas the minimum wage in France is €1500, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started to look down on me just because I was Muslim.
Like I was some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work basically anywhere else and I came across an open position at Air France here in Prague.
I must confess, I didn't know Prague at all at first.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of the whole different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up on any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people here are freer.
That I can do anything, dress anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, you're always looked at unpleasantly, like when you're dressed in strange clothes and such.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the people of Prague care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After my job at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend and I started a website where people search for and bid on shared housing.
We're only in Prague, but we'd like to expand to all of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czech, and two other Czech friends.
I must say, another characteristic of the Czechs is that they are more distant at first.
They don't let anyone near them.
It's a little different from where I grew up.
In the South, everyone hugs and kisses each other on the face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
In Prague, on the other hand, it's pretty easy, because I think everyone here speaks English.
Even at parties or in the grocery store.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And since everyone can communicate in English at least a little bit, I don't have that much need to learn the language fast.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Did you encounter any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also because I work in an international environment that's more tolerant.
I have an experience.
My supervisor, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something like, "They're not French, they're Africans".
That really touched me.
But that anyone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, that's never happened to me.
And that's despite the fact that a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said not to go downtown, they'd call me names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the present situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I could not imagine that such a thing could happen in France.
And it's not just for Muslims.
Islam also does not recognize violence at all.
To me, people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says that a man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists protecting themselves by your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to watch the violence news too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at the square of George of Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims joined Christians in a protest against violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they should do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little bit more religious than I am, so we sometimes have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all have a little bit different perceptions of it.
I'm from France, so I went through a different education, they might have learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of women.
How do you see it?
I don't feel subordinate in any way.
More like the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It's also related to the fact that you're not wearing a head covering.
Like the hijab?
And it's mostly about the way I was raised.
My mom, for example, is a very committed Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to each of us how we interpret it.
When you read the Koran, you should make your own opinion about these things.
So when I read the passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought, I'm not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I go to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where they require headscarves, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
For now, yes.
I've never felt so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm having a great time in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for that, I think.
Czech Muslims joined Christians in protesting against violence.
The goat yacht Fenclo has been blown to pieces by the wind in Rio.
The Friday sea trips in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were sent by the Czech yacht Veronica Kozelská Fenclové.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two starts.
That would have ensured the Czech Republic's participation in the final race.
You collect packages like pokemon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of shipments is behind the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
And with that idea, they've given life to three apps with different geographical reach.
We launched the national app, Transit, in May.
There are a thousand cities on it right now, and we're expanding the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says the forty-one-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transport app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and sign up for free.
Then you can enter the route and the data, how big a package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone might ask for a ride that day.
When the route and delivery time match, it's paired and both parties get notifications.
At that moment, a chat will open where the couple will arrange a handover.
How many people would you estimate would have to register to have each package always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal situation, I can't estimate how many registrations and how many routes are needed to make the coverage completely optimal and to match each supply with the demand.
It's already working on the main roads, and it's logically easier than, say, going between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust and finding out that no one can get away with the package.
You haven't had to deal with a case like this before?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people building roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be packed.
Is there any chance the sender might be waiting too long?
We hope to compete with the big conglomerates simply because we can deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you'll pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll pay maybe a hundred less here, because that's a route someone's already taking.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, it's fed by huge multinational carriers, as well as chain stores, where everyone started shopping and gradually realized that the quality didn't match what they were paying for.
Nobody wants to find a note in their inbox saying they're supposed to pick up a shipment at the branch, and not later than 7:00 p.m. that day.
I needed a package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster, more functional service that doesn't bother anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
The Commission has also received comments from the interested parties.
None of them have ever made an impact in the IT industry.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started developing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already scheduled routes between world metropolises, mainly by air, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to develop a company that developed applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
The Transporter app started development in December last year and was released in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesicek and Mesicek Profi apps were developed since January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The idea from the beginning was to make all these apps that one day would merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, to focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been the topic of recent times, and this is a service like Airbnb or Uber.
Aren't you afraid to be in a field where nobody can tell you where the boundaries of sharing and the grey economy are?
It's the same, just a different product.
We know that if this is successful and we go up, we're going to be the next thorn in the side of the grey economy.
But while some people save and some people make money, it's not the intention to bypass the financial authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make a profit from it.
What makes you think the service has so much potential?
The shipper saves and the carrier earns, or reduces, the cost of the journey.
That's the powerful idea that connects the interests of both sides.
In an age of social media that divides people, we would like this one to bring people together.
There can be good stories, people are happy to help someone, and they'll tell about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
I think people have been missing the personal approach for a long time, and we call this app a service of the people to the people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package won't escape?
Each user of the application scans his/her identity card and provides a bank account, debit or credit card number at the time of registration.
These are the channels that give credibility to the service and to the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on the ratings of the senders.
We'll offer insurance, we're still working on the details.
The courier is responsible for the unsecured consignment in case of loss or damage, but is not liable under criminal law for the contents if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or 10 kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his trunk, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
The data are, if necessary, traceable by the administrative authority, which alone will be able to inspect it, even we are not able to see them ourselves, the data are protected against misuse.
How much money does the courier get after the shipment is successfully delivered?
The courier will set the price and get the full amount he wants.
The sender is charged a few percent extra for the contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push volume.
Nor can a courier be accused of not delivering a package when he actually delivered it, and both receipt and delivery are verified by QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or the contents of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a plateau of eggs, and large as a keg of beer.
Then there's no more restrictions, and if anyone has room in the car, they'll just carry the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what's being requested.
You don't even have to pack it unless you want to hide the contents in the box.
You put a forgotten sweater in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to get the service up and running?
A friend of mine had an idea over two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo of a cross-border application that's primarily targeting passenger aircraft.
At that moment, I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I wanted to become one myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year of development before we founded Shippansee LTD in London to increase the credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you're focusing on right now.
No, we've been marketing to the Czech Republic, where we're trying to get the app because it's been a pain in the neck and there's still a lot to work on.
We're trying to respond to customer feedback, and we're not really doing that much in the overseas market right now.
We know it's a long run, but we're not stalling, we want to make a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were kind of an upgrade.
The transfer was made when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact same address halfway around the world.
It works for senders just like Transit, but the difference is that in it, as a courier, you see the shipments as the points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocation on your phone.
The app for couriers who want to make a living off of it, we call it Pro-Month.
So someone can make a pretty good living picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the latest app downloads in Prague, like a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a way to work.
Now that everyone's messing with the pokemon, they can collect this just the same.
You see where the orders are in the city, you go to it, you click on it, you see when it needs to be delivered, and it's shipped.
It's set up cheaper than competing services.
We're also currently developing a web interface that will be the backbone for companies to send mail, fill in the data on the web, or create points on the map.
We're able to bill them for their usage of the service, like, every month.
Are you now a full-time project?
It's a little stressful, but we normally have it at work so we can keep the project going.
We're not a powerful multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other one jumped in with other incentives and ideas.
Now we're looking for an investor strong enough to manage not only the Czech market with us, but who should, with the balls, join us in a global product and become the next big player in the market like Airbnb and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring a variety that's almost forgotten.
That'll fix the second part, and the solo gameplay will be more varied than Call of Duty, according to initial reports.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the content is based on the concept of networking in the first part.
So you can look forward to the freedom of movement that includes the possibility of using the combat titan in addition to running.
In addition to the action-packed passages, the game will feature levels focused on agility.
They'll resemble plates and include ribbons.
For example, double-jumping, wall-running, and rope-sliding are essential to overcome them.
And sometimes, we have to eliminate the enemy.
There will also be labyrinth-like maps and levels with special concepts.
One will have platforms that can be raised and lowered and massive doors that can be closed.
You'll be adjusting the look of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should fluctuate between the furious action and the more tranquil moments of exploring an unknown planet.
We're going to play footman Jack Cooper, the dream of a career pilot.
Cooper, along with Captain Lastimos, crash-lands on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilds there will not be lenient to him.
Lastimos will also suffer fatal injuries in the crash, and Cooper will be tasked with restoring the captain's Titan.
His dream of becoming a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the batteries needed to repair the robot.
Cooper's calls with the titan will be significant, too.
It will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but also provide humorous moments through robotic personalized communication.
For example, if Titan were to dry-list all the injuries Cooper is likely to sustain during his planned research.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign came from the Polygon server.
Plus, the results will be available to review in two months, and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions of the online game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is out on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come back to life, but the original publishing house will remain dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
Nordic has released such titles as Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, the company is developing 23 more games, 13 of which have not yet been revealed.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a man 20 years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she was obviously trying for a while, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, I guess her type, 'cause she's been with a guy like that before me.
She's totally into him.
In those early days, her voice even changed, she had this girlish, love-struck voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I watched the whole thing.
He would leave work regularly at half past four, so she would always leave at three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to see him.
I found out later that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there right now?
I got the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I always ended up sitting at home.
I never got to go out there, make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife was mentally controlling me.
I think she soon found out that I was controllable, that I would do whatever she wanted.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just being a little bit of a wuss.
And the neighbors suggested that he knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk, I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only the daughter knew.
So I've always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to ask for help with something in the laundry.
He went with me, and I told him I got anonymous, that he was seeing my wife, and that he was all the evidence.
I asked him what he'd say.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, stared at the ground and didn't say a word.
Then, at that time, I met his wife on the way home from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe me.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
Nobody said anything to me back then.
I'm the kind of guy who's never been out much, who has trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I never thought about divorce.
I kept counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her and move on.
But it wasn't.
And I never really got over it.
I still have it in me.
I've shown her a lot of things before, but I've finally let it go.
He's still living next door, and I'm still living with her.
It's just that she's more than my wife my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's a workaholic.
I always thought she was trying to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And she's kind of a good person, you know?
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We're walking and shopping together, and everyone thinks we're happily married.
But she told me once that she never loved me.
That she had me and she liked me, but she didn't love me.
And I can see that she still loves him, he's her god.
And I'm sick of living like this.
Even when it started, and I was having a really bad time, I told her once that I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she'd say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree to it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room".
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, and is calling on the government and the local Muslim minority to help.
"Unless the Muslims themselves help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion", said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
The one that will ensure that only the clergy of France will preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where money often comes from preachers who are infused with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, it was supposed to help make financial flows between mosques and the countries that fund their construction more transparent.
But soon she was struck by internal contradictions, and never functioned properly.
"It's a complete failure", Valls said.
The new foundation will be headed by former Minister of the Interior and Defense Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known for his support for a secular state.
There are some 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which are dedicated to radical Islam.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics, and dozens more are considering doing so.
This week, German police also struck down jihadist clerics.
Imams were allegedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a facility where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France about a new institution to replace the defunct foundation.
All of this has precipitated further terrorist attacks by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to provide financing for mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee the imams.
It is not yet clear where the funding will come from, although several proposals are under consideration.
One is a special tax on halal food, especially meat from Islamic slaughterhouses.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food sellers for licensing.
Some of the money would go directly into the foundation's budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, some 30,000 people leave France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, only preachers who have completed educational programs at French universities should serve in French mosques.
This would make their preaching consistent with democracy.
The government is also closing down radical mosques.
"Since December, we have arrested 20 of them and more will follow", said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men", he said.
I'm going to Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously wounded by an unknown gunman Friday morning in a shopping mall in Zaragoza, northern Spain, reports the Independent.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in a car outside the mall, where the shooting started.
Witnesses say the man then turned the gun on himself, reports the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by her uninjured daughter, and the man was in critical condition.
The incident took place around 11am in the central part of the metropolitan region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the recent unresolved divorce of both partners.
Wrap with lime, wakame with algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer is for light, easy-to-digest food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our own tastes and our own heads.
And so the summer gardens smell of grilled necklaces, a buck, a pig's claw.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, except for the occasional salad or baked vegetables.
True, barbecuing saves time and dishes, and it's a social affair, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make it good with delicacies that make the meal special, that are a little ritual to prepare, but at the same time, you don't have to cook, bake, fry or choke anything for a long time.
And they're also good for our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-developed griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as the even easier rice paper rolls from today's recipe.
Even the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is wasted.
The paper can be soaked in water for a moment, and then it's all up to the cook's imagination to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of many Asian dishes today is that the ingredients are usually readily available.
Including the stuffed sweet-sour ginger, which is one of the staples of sushi or fresh rolls.
You can make it at home, but true pink ginger gari has a unique spicy flavor and deliciousness thanks to a secret recipe that says it's mixed with several types of vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of the right size, and you've got a patch with proven antibacterial effects, which can help with digestion and resist coughing or flu.
Banana leaves.
They are used especially in Buddhist and Hindu cultures for serving and decorating dishes in various ceremonial occasions and rituals.
The long, gnarled leaves of the banana tree are also widely used in many Asian and South American countries as a "tool" for preparing a variety of baked, cooked, and fried dishes, which are wrapped in them in a similar way to alobals.
The banana leaf also gives the food a specific flavor.
They can be bought in shops with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
Choose only leaves that are green, that is, healthy - uncracked and unstained.
Likewise, it is easy to prepare a salad made from wakame algae, sesame, and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
If you're a sushi person, you're probably familiar with nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, and it is made by cutting, pressing, and drying nori leaves - plates specifically designed for sushi.
Wakame - a dark green algae that grows in the waters around Hokkaido - is also eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as nori.
By the way, who doesn't know that wakame miso soup is said to be used by Asian women for the recovery of childbirth.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, boosts circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of the hair, and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and ground wakame is also used as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae is first soaked in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water, and simmered for half a minute.
Then they are cooled in ice water, cut off the middle ribs, and further processed, perhaps as a favorite salad.
But buying it ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all you have to do is wrap a roll with a light vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
It's a longevity bombshell.
If you resist and don't add a grilled beak.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
All you need is a few special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh dish that combines delicious flavors.
And it's done one by two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 grams of carrots, 40 grams of white radish, 100 grams of green cabbage, 60 grams of pickles, 60 grams of wakame algae and 60 grams of sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped cilantro, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoonful of shiracha chili sauce, 20g of mango and 40g of cured ginger gari, some pine nuts.
First we'll get the wraps ready.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, we boil the branches briefly in hot water, and after about three minutes, we quickly cool them in ice water to keep their color.
We'll put a vegetable filling on the permitted paper and wrap it.
We prepare the filling with white radish, carrots, and cucumber salad, cut them into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped cilantro, mix thoroughly, and put on rice paper.
We put the branches of the banana leaf, add the curls, and finish the dish with wakame, ginger, a slice of mango, black sesame, and a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in the rugby sevens, Fiji's pick takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in rugby sevens ended with a devastating run at the last hurdle, Fiji defeating Great Britain in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio, 43 to 7.
The Fijians mastered the skills of handling, folding, bending, supporting play, running on a rope, and brute force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with the unprecedented consolation of a silver medal - Britain's third on the day - and the British could be proud of their performance in the inaugural Olympic rugby sevens tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A 7-7 win over South Africa in the semi-finals on the same day, may have frozen them in the final.
But Fiji, in its form, would beat a 15-man team in good health.
It may not be a consolation for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former England manager at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has been offended a bit.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They lost one here.
This defeat may hurt, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started off great, the British incursions were repelled for joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other players, it was like running behind a line of moving buses, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer was four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawu and prevent him from scoring a third, but only slowed the Fijians down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17 to 0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return and the clock was still more than 1 minute away... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then broke through the British's small line and hit the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29-0 there was a break.
It was like Fiji was born for rugby 7s while the British were still learning the passing.
That's exactly how it is.
The British made a massive half-time change and stopped the Fijian attack... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova, after a brilliant mid-game, made his way through.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown into the left corner on a 36-7 overtime, but the game had long been won by the Pacific Islanders, and their fans were singing, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the Fijians' highly enthusiastic attitude.
In the final moments, Matt William sweetened the Fijians' victory with another attempt.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced, and the British fell on the grass, all spoiled.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semifinals, and Great Britain defeated South Africa in the semifinals by a single conversion.
Kyle Brown led the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton's brilliant footwork broke through the line and scored in the second half under the hook.
A great late set by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England U15 team, secured the victory - and eventually the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won the rowing race inspired by the coach's battle with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold at these Games, and that's for sure.
From the first shot to the last, over 220 punishing breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While there were two on the boat, there were three voices on board, and as the boat whistled over the surface to meet its second Olympic gold in a row in the women's pairs, they were joined on board by the voice of the ever-present coach Robin Williams, the first women in British sporting history to achieve such a feat.
Their dominance was absolute, it was their 39th race overall, in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two outstanding athletes flying across the water with the elegance of swans - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a battalion of helping hands that make a difference, bit by bit, and no hands have been more helpful than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, didn't know if he'd live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
He said it was uncertain.
I had bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I had this operation.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It changes your perspective a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The good news for the trio was that he was able to start treatment early in 2014, off-season, and cut his downtime to a minimum - if that's what we can call it under the circumstances.
I needed to make some money, so I had to get my act together fast.
That was a spur.
I was in the hospital, and I walked around the room -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would do.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to manage his own restlessness.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery who has completed a tour of duty in Afghanistan, said: "I've been feeling down this week, it may be a little extreme, but it means so much".
It just goes to show how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked together, and Robin has.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin so far.
We wouldn't be a thing without Robin, so he's got a lot to thank for, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better man to train, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were as focused as we could be at the moment.
Helen was shouting, "Don't stop, don't stop".
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve anything famous.
We weren't looking forward to the fireworks tonight, we just wanted to hang up, go out and win the race, which we did.
Couple takes a year to think before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her new fiance is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean it was my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took about six months in London before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it, she said.

The prison?
"Let's get people for free", says taxi-trap hunter Rubeš to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former official of the Prague Magistrates' Office are accused, according to the Czech Republic.
You've made a series of reports exposing fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will stand trial.
You've had a few unpleasant confrontations with exposed actors over it.
How much of a breakthrough is the news of the indictment of organized group members to you?
I was expecting a trial, maybe.
I'm just curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in prison.
It's not worth it.
First of all, they should return all the money they stole.
And they should give it back by giving everyone free rides.
That's a pretty good solution.
Does that mean you don't see the punishment as effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared they don't do the job anymore.
Like, one makes a pinch, another unpacks a pizza, and one just gives up on it.
The defendants could theoretically face two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
I have a problem with detention in general.
I consider that a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in a case like this, is nonsense.
People like that should give back to the society they took from.
For a quarter of a century, they've been doing this, trashing our country's reputation and stealing people's shit.
Now let them make a good card and give people a free ride.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a public service.
If someone goes to collect the garbage, they'll get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get parole eventually and they're not gonna care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
He's one of the people who started making viral videos and videos for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the Internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, now prepares the program Prague Guide, which is aimed primarily at foreign viewers.
In short reports, Rubeš advises them on which services in Prague they should avoid and which they should use without fear.
He previously directed series called How to, City of Frauds, Life in Luxury, Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of crooked cabbies be called mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from Commodore.
They're more like mobsters, junior boys, but they're definitely organized.
Just the fact that they're guarding each other's stables.
Prague is all flat.
I've found that, for example, the main train station doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like taxi drivers waiting at Charles Lazer.
Everyone just keeps their own little place and every group is organized in some way.
It's probably a tangled web.
But the defendants are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver about the checks.
As you said, the unwanted phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague taxis are scammers, according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones are still out there.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryaček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic pillow in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and drives people.
Last time I drove with him, he wanted me to pay 700 for three kilometers.
The police didn't arrest him for some reason.
They picked just a few people from the whole big group.
The same situation is, of course, also at other locations in Prague.
So it's hard to get rid of the already famous Prague mess, which is probably much bigger, by indicting seven people.
It's of course useless.
It helps, but all evil doesn't wash away, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still appear in the same places you showed in the reports, namely at the Charles Bridge or on the Paris street?
Yes, that's right.
They're standing in these locations every day, and every day they're violating regulations.
The city police and the Prague Magistrates ignore it.
It's not even kittens anymore, but total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet, some of them, even a fraction of the group, will be brought to justice.
That's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask, do you feel satisfied?
If I take it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve downtown Prague.
And even though I feel like I need to do a little better, I'm going to keep doing it.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief is left, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't just settle for that.
But that's not the case. There are, of course, more.
You're always trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test drives sometimes, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cabbie, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he later claimed that it was 56 crowns (he used the decimal trick).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cab driver was so cute and rude, he kept going to the cops and asking them when they'd finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver pasted a decimal on the meter and stole 357 crowns from tourists.
Can you say that the insolence of the rogue taxi drivers has not abated even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged ridiculous amounts for a short ride?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
What happened to the cab driver who demanded 56 crowns?
The cops sent him away saying they couldn't discuss it with him on the spot because he put out a receipt.
And that's going to be a problem, I think, even in this courtroom.
There's a taxi driver with his receipts on one side, and the police on the other.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate is not allowed to use the secret recordings from the taxi service as evidence in court.
When I was filming the scenes of their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I'm shooting but I always wanted to use it for reporting.
Are you worried that this fact might protect them from prosecution?
I hope every judge will understand that no cab driver could drive for six or ten crowns a mile, because he wouldn't make a living.
You were talking about the decimal trick that underwater cab drivers usually pull in front of foreign clients.
Is it still current, or are they afraid to use this fiddle after your stories are published?
I think we've popularized this trick by broadcasting the show in reverse.
I was driving with this cab driver recently, bragging to me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed a black card on the side of the meter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is".
If the fines didn't work for the crooked taxi drivers, can they be warned by the court of their colleagues?
Is there anything that can discourage them from cheating?
You said you thought they always found a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can discourage them.
But someone could be pushing them out of those places.
And these are the fair taxi drivers who should be fighting harder to get them out of there.
In my experience, the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately the dominant.
But do they have the will to go against those who tarnish the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but no mind.
They don't know how to walk around and they don't know exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for a comprehensive restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnaczová), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
They said they weren't protesting Uber, they just wanted the same terms and conditions as this service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
So what happened was they just blocked Prague and it turned out to be the best possible commercial for Uber.
What is your overall assessment of the approach of the Prague Magistrates' Office in dealing with the problem of overpricing?
You can see that the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The magistrate was short on time.
They had a mole there that would give out information, which means the taxi department had been doing its job for years in vain.
I hope that officer gets charged for all the failed checks until the last check, so he realizes what he did.
That's the worst part.
I even went on a test drive with him, which I found out later from their schedule.
It's been months since the last installment of the series was published.
What's the response?
I mean, mostly foreign audiences, which is what the show is really focused on.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them the videos.
And then when we walk down Old Town Square, they're surprised to find that the same people you see in the pictures are actually standing there.
Notorious Prague celebrities.
I mean it.
I'd put a curtain around them for people to look at.
The museum of communism right down the street.
My last question is clear.
You take a cab when you need to?
- I know.
I'm on a service where I don't have to pay cash, but I pay by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there's no possibility of fraud.
But there are many dispatchers who are fair.
I've only taken a cab once since then.
As I got into the car, the driver said, "Well, you're brave".
Bhem disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported as far back as 2005.
Former mayor Pavel Bém went on a test drive that year dressed as an Italian tourist and was cheated by a driver of 200 on his first attempt.
But editor Rubesh has had worse experiences.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for the trip from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which is about 195 crowns per kilometer, according to the report's creators.
The Prague Municipality has set a maximum price of 28 CZK per kilometer.
The report also includes other surprising figures: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Paris Street to Truhlárská cost the tourist 400 CZK.
The taxis waiting at Charles Bridge also provided expensive rides.
They charge up to 600 kroner for a two-and-a-half-kilometer ride on Angel.
The marble is washed mostly with pure water, as much as possible without chemicals, and the longer the better.
The dirt is fine, although sometimes the dirt has to be scalped down, it has to be pulled out of the creases.
It's not easy and it's not fast, says the restorationist Vanessa Trost from Oldrichov in The Hague.
Hat down: a tomb is a staircase that requires climbing and descending countless times.
"A restaurateur should be careful, patient and unpretentious in the work environment", she noted.
This is far from her first restoration work in Frydland.
Thanks to her, the stone facade elements in the rear of the Frydlant City Hall were restored, as well as the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiše, St. John of Nepomuk in Frydlant, Pieta in Frydlant's District Street, the Marian column in Frydlant and the Atlanteans in the front of the spa in the New Town under Smrk.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Rüdern began in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleared of impurities and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; they will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
Surface treatment and preservation are also required.
The inscriptions on the tombs will turn gold again.
"Then the marble slabs will be gilded with pure gold", said Věra Sobotová, a spokeswoman for the State Monument Protection Department of the city of Frydlant.
There's no record of any repairs to the tombstone in the past.
At a closer look, they're holes drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and they're remnants of the decoration of the tomb.
It was richly decorated, but unfortunately, after the invasion of the Swedes in the Thirty Years' War, it all disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstone, Sabotova noted.
The church of the Holy Cross is restored with a slight exaggeration.
After the 2010 flood, tombs that had been submerged had to be repaired, the baptistery, the murals in the tomb, and now the tomb itself had to be restored.
"We would like to do stained glass in the future", Sobotová revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
The restoration work on the Redern tomb will cost 128 thousand crowns.
They'll be paid for by grants, and the city won't put any of its own money into this part of the renovation.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winner in the regional round of the Historic City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is then a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, the mayor of Frydlant Dan Ramzer specified.
The council decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tomb.
Expert views on future developments on selected foreign markets, monitored by means of indices and compared with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one month and six months.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have thought that at the beginning of the year?
The S&P 500, which was down 12% in February, is now at a new all-time high, up 7% since the start of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks in the long run, which have always succeeded in the long run.
With US stocks at their historic highs, volatility is disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew with confidence and fearlessness thanks to quantitative easing by the US central bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) was held steadily below 12 percent.
And I don't want you to.
While the Fed continues to prepare markets for gradual interest rate hikes, quantitative easing is in full swing in Europe and Japan, and last week the Bank of England joined the work, buying £70 billion in bonds over the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing thus pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
That's the question in a million, of course.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is growing almost constantly without any major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilizing, and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to hold in a similarly calm regime.
It's a pity Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician to do this difficult job, said European Commission President Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (a real expert, having held so many different transnational political positions that we could hardly ask for a better example of the so-called European elite) as the European Commission's chief negotiator on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.
Juncker's choice has dampened any hope that the EU is seriously interested in seeking forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
But most of the British media has adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock-solid European federalist.
He hates Britain.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He understood it as only he could: a staunch enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the capitalist model.
The multilateral regulator, co-author of the banking union and a fierce opponent of everything from the City of London financial centre, has pushed through legislation to regulate the financial sector and services to an extremely harsh level.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, uncompromising and probably ruthless negotiator.
That's not good news.
In this context, how can we not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much?
That is why Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies even today.
It is a pity that Juncker has not learned from Václav Klaus - at least in this respect.
It would be for the good of all!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler has released his close friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday fired Sergei Ivanov as chief of staff.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by Russian media, citing a statement by the Kremlin press service.
Putin has indicated that Ivanova is being released at his own request.
In a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24 television, the president said he was meeting Ivanov's wishes, expressed at the time of his inauguration, to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The news of the change in the head of the presidential administration, now led by Ivanov's former deputy Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is described as one of Putin's closest aides.
For example, this former KGB officer has previously held the positions of Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
Now he's leaving the chair of the President's Security Council.
But Ivanov said in his meeting with Putin that the length of time he's been in the administration of the head of state is actually a record.
He's been there four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people had already been replaced in this function in the 25 years since its establishment.
Neither the Flowers nor the Debilists will play the final with Uncle and Shapiro.
So far, none of Friday's tennis matches have been turned into a final.
The first fight was lost by Petra Kvitova, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvit was followed by the Czech idiots "Safariva" and "Untičová".
The Williams sisters' opponents were looking to win in the first set, but they missed two setbacks and the Russians finally captured a set in the shortened game.
The second set was lost by a score of 4-6.
Half-time success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skipper Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with a clear shot, when he beat the other Damir Martin from Croatia despite slowing in the final by almost a second.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind had calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Sonek said.
His rivals, unlike him, had to fight for the lead.
So they're just a little bit down, so tomorrow might be easier.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, I'm just playing cards, said the oarsman of Prague's Dukla.
But Mirka Topink-Knapková did not follow in Snyko's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower finished fourth in her semi-final today and will compete in the B final on Saturday for seventh to 12th place.
London gold is not so defensive.
It's the first time I've missed the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I was in a good race and I put everything I had into it.
The rivals were just better, and Topink Knapko bowed to them.
She fought to the end, and she believed she'd make it to the Elite Six in her fourth Games.
The battle was lost just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could move up from that field.
I was surprised to see the Chinese woman with the finish.
And I thought I could go through the Austrian to the finals.
Unfortunately, she was in the race for life today, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to break out of qualifying for the second time, this time with a badly injured leg, remained.
In it, Nepechal finished 33rd.
The Russians qualified best.
From the first row, Sergei Kamensky advanced with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigoryan (628.9).
Nepechal's stake was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time at the Rio program, including Czech seven-boaters Kateřina Cachová and Eliska Klučinová.
Cachó is 11th in the second discipline of the Olympic competition, while Czech record holder Eliska Klučinová is 22nd.
The British Katarina Johnson-Thompson leads the way, jumping to a height of 198 centimetres, as does the second-ranked Belgian, Nafissatou Thiam.
Both set the record for the highest altitude performance in a seven-fight battle.
They tried to jump another 201 centimeters, but they failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
If we look beyond the absurdity of the questions posed, German society has gone through a profound self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In both of the great Eurasian nations, dictatorships emerged in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of Communism, as the Black Book of Communism lists, whether through daily individual repression, targeted starvation, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly exterminated about 6 million Jews, and I estimate the total death toll of World War II to be 60 million.
Atrocities were committed by the Germans and the Soviets in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not just a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively, or simply by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
It's not just the peoples' fault, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, immediately after the end of the war, came denazification, the Nuremberg Trials.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew older, they began to ask: "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you!
It brought about a real reflection and healing of society.
Until recently, the German elite was primarily concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the welfare of its citizens.
Now they have other (often naive idealistic) goals, but they are certainly not about reuniting Alsace-Lorraine or attacking someone - for a rematch - militarily - I think everyone will admit that.
After losing the Cold War, there was no great reflection in Russia.
The window of possible positive change was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
Putin's policy in Russia is revenge, to recapture lost territory, to humiliate the West.
The health, prosperity and future of their own people are of no value to the elite.
Kill your own, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe it's just those decades of despotic rule, that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior -- predestined to Asian tyranny.
Who benefits from the increased tension over Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from increased tension?
After a period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have again deteriorated.
The Ukrainian side's pretext has been the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than two years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from both sides of the conflict are, of course, contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we can only think about the old familiar question: Who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks in Crimea on the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine, of course, denies and instead accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
In the case of the pilot Savchenko, the information on the arrests of Ukrainian special forces personnel in Russia was answered by the known answer that they were allegedly abducted in Russia.
If we go with the Ukrainian version, what would Russia gain from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions over Crimea can only harm Russia, especially from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and intensifying of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the migration crisis in Europe has led to a shift in attention away from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit to its people, with the current support for President Poroshenko hovering around 15%.
The Ukrainian economy would have gone bankrupt long ago without generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to once again attract significant attention to its country to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation with voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the military leadership want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both hostile sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest level in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero level since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0,8%.
The Commission therefore concluded that the measures in force in the PRC were not sufficient to restore the viability of the Union industry.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0,2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 vs. July 2015 was -0,2%.
Compared to the previous month, the following categories of consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), culture and recreation (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), other goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2,2%), furniture, household goods and general maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as in the previous month.
The U.S. Secret Service has been tracking Russian hacking for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to light last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was working on a hack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
But there's no official report of Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report on the alleged Russian attack was highly classified because if it were released, it would reveal that the U.S. intelligence community was monitoring the hacking attack, and it could reveal how they were doing it and what resources they were using.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
The new Cybersecurity Advisory Board is set up.
The Russian tracking material was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, known in the U.S. as the Gang of Eight, were informed by public officials.
It's comprised of the House and Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the House and Senate Democratic chairs Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the House Defense and Security Committees.
Democratic Party chief executive Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in the minced salmon from Alberta.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's complaint about health problems after eating wild-fed salmon - 100 g pieces, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygienists carried out a check in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Mostku.
The verification found that the batch L23012562/T4 with a date of consumption of 22.11.2016 that the customer had pointed out was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with a date of consumption of 11.12.2016 was withdrawn.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex was confirmed by laboratory examination.
It's a parasitic worm in the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous to humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a potent allergen, and live larvae eaten by humans can penetrate the stomach wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We're very sorry to the customers for the trouble with this branded product.
This batch was immediately withdrawn and all other batches of this item were withdrawn as a precautionary measure.
"The mistake was made by the supplier we are dealing with, and we have had this product tested ourselves", spokesman Albert Barbora Vanko told Novinkom.
If the customer purchased the product, he can return it at any of the chain's stores and get the money back.
The larvae will be destroyed by frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton-Vrnata.
The presence of the dangerous product was reported by the hygienists to the veterinary authorities of Prague and Central Bohemia.
According to safetyfood.cz, people who ingest the parasite may develop anisakiosis, which can result in severe stomach pains, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may go untreated, the CTC said.
Symptoms appear one to two weeks after consumption of under-treated infected fish.
After three weeks of the onset of the disease, the larvae usually leave the digestive tract spontaneously.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures and are therefore killed either by adequate heat treatment of the fish meat or by freezing it.
The veterinarians have also tested salmon on the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples we tested had the parasite.
A consignment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic in early April, according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS).
Shipped, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, were 919 packages to date.
At present, the withdrawal of unsold stocks of the product from the stores is underway, said on Friday the spokesman of the SVS Petr Pejchal.
The veterinarians immediately prohibited the dispatch of further products from the warehouse after finding positive samples.
A 17-year-old British girl tried to flee Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian airstrike.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, came the sobering.
The expected paradise of the caliphate had turned into a hell on earth for British girls from which there was no escape.
The girl's relatives said she was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called her repeatedly to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving ISIS is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to fire without thinking, quotes The Telegraph, the lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last trail led to Rakka, where the girl last spoke.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
Her family communicated with her from her East London flat.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
They were hoping to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape because her house was razed to the ground in May, UK's ITV News reported.
The TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would take the blue sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
During the week she was contemplating fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, was beaten to death in public.
I think she (Kadiza) took it as a warning and decided not to take the risk, according to BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadisha Sutlana, along with her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set out on a journey on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was they were going out.
But they were headed to Gatwick Airport and back via Turkey into ISIL-controlled territory.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadizu back.
You would have taken the blues out of the sky just to get your kid out of the danger zone, and this family did everything they could, they did everything they could to get their daughter home.
But they could not do so without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that Kadzy's fate could serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people have gone there, realized how things are there, understood how far it differs from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return", Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they too have been silenced, their families must come to terms with the fact that they are most likely dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the county seat and seat of the Dukes of Argyll.
From the mid-18th century, the town hall was used for court proceedings, and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
Conditions were deplorable, and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them successfully.
So the city decided to move the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more hospitable to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for long, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as the smaller correction facilities were expensive to operate and not very profitable.
The stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, and visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
The tour guides in period costumes add to the authenticity of the experience.
There is also a torture chamber where visitors can learn about the forms of punishment used on criminals, whether it was the breaking of fingers or the burning of marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists may be locked in a cell, usually for a souvenir photo or to experience the feeling of being behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland's most notorious haunted locations.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have been there, and the museum still allows people to come and hunt for ghosts.
But that night will cost £300, which is about $1,500.
Besides being a popular tourist attraction, the town is also attractive for its fine food, scenic views, and history.
The "animated" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users every day to alter reality and manipulate identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple or a dog or a figure that looks like it came out of a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate over 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any mistakes will be published immediately.
Snapchat's filters have been criticized in the past for promoting blackfacing or for promoting white skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when she offered users this week a filter that made them have slanted eyes, crooked teeth and puffy faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - yellowface.
And they asked if these repeated controversial questions pointed to a larger problem in society -- the problem of diversity.
And on Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard posted about it, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat said the very next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a display of the accounts of anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
The others refused to make a straightforward comparison to the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing".
She added that it's hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellowface, but that the yellowface is taken to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless battle for diversity and inclusion, from the corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older partners -- may mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
"When a Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user", 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday, "it's very difficult to go unnoticed like it used to be".
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she stated that she believes that racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company and ended the article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have diversity among the staff and people of color at the time when these things are decided", said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American descent, "or there are people of color working but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak".
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its employees, as it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu added: "I wonder if they really need more users like this who can say that it's not okay" with their account being deleted.
Military officers misrepresented intelligence on IS, parliamentary committee says
The parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that U.S. Central Command officers had altered intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than was provided by events on the ground.
According to a preliminary report by a task force composed of the Republican Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, there was "widespread dissatisfaction" among CIA analysts that their superiors were changing their assessment of the U.S. effort to defeat ISIS.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report states:  Intelligence intelligence releases approved by senior Centcom officers have typically offered a more positive picture of US counterterrorism efforts than was confirmed by facts on the ground, and have been consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are being harmed when a faulty analysis is presented to senior policymakers", said Ken Calvert, congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reaches to the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analyzing the US efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be modified, the report says analysts felt they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
In the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters press reports, statements and congressional testimony were substantially more positive than what the events actually were, the report states.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military offensive to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is all clear after months of investigation", said Congressman Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking members of the US Central Intelligence Agency manipulated the intelligence output of the Central Intelligence Agency in order to downplay the danger posed by ISIL in Iraq.
Republicans set up a task force after analysts raised concerns that intelligence related to ISIS was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday must be followed by further investigation.
There is an ongoing investigation at Centcom Intelligence, led by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican task force's findings.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom developed a very tight process for compiling assessments of information on IS and Iraqi security forces", said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and a Democrat.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "led to the distortion of intelligence outputs", "damaged morale among analysts", and "insufficiently took into account disagreements".
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their findings based on the proposal or the political situation.
The preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report because the inspector general's investigation is still ongoing.
He noted, however, that experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues.
The investigation has implications beyond whether the American-led bombing of Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now being made by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusation raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can be trusted to give the Joint Chiefs an honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Intelligence criticism of the Islamic State has been reflecting conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper that suggested that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - had defended a small unit in Iraq and had given little time to consider what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, authorities reported that Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes against ISIS refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's financial resources, as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not passed on outside headquarters.
Centcom's commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to be too positive of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States has won the field hockey game for the fourth straight time, so today's deciding game will be against the Great Britain team.
Katie Bam scored three goals in the 6-1 win over Japan, and just a day later, she scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team in the 3-0 win over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a feat to remember, but Bam, 27, said she wasn't sure she'd ever done anything like that.
"I have no idea", she said.
I'm not one to write down my goals.
But he knows this: The Americans are 4-0 up in the Olympic tournament, and share first place in the group with Great Britain, who remained unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the six teams finish first and which finish second.
The first-place team will avoid the strong Danes, who are leading the second group, for a little while.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans have caused a sensation here with their surprise run, four years after finishing among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey for the first time when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor her teammates were doing very well.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change", said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the first half with a close-range punt.
India entered the match without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took the opportunity.
She ran off the left side of the field, then clicked into the center and shot the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had helped a goal in each of the three victories, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now", said Parnham, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of the game on Saturday.
Zen trampolines in the midst of the Olympic fury
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, it's the Olympics.
What happened in Rio de Janeiro is a persistent, indescribable, biased interchange of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a hot stick that's passed from the champion to the swimmer, gymnast and triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the up-and-coming ladies' darling with the cheekbones, is at the Olympics for the first time, and he could also be among the ones whose names ring in the homes in prime time between commercials and sponsors' spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in the long jump.
The Olympic flame does not shine the same at all competitions.
Farther from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always be successful in the classic style of swimming and will probably reign for a long time.
But if I may name my special favorite, let me point out the unobtrusive magic of the trampoline.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic sport since it was first introduced at the 2000 Games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention, the sport has gone almost unnoticed - many of the people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in the springboard, and until 2012, none of the athletes had even made it to the finals.
Prices in the men's category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year's gold medals from London will be contested by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But trampolining is also unlucky, in part because to the uninitiated, it's more likely to be a good fit for clown college than for the Olympics.
I must confess I'm no expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential -- the comic vibe of endless reflection -- but also the charm of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampolin", which means "jump board".
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline that shoots them to a height of nearly 30 feet [10 m], performing a number of jumps, bouts, and combinations before finally landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated on performance, difficulty and "time in the air".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The gold medalists have to go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He is trying to catch not only the finish line or the starting line but, as the TV news reports, another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the viewers to tears.
But I also find it a little exhausting watching the Olympics.
Trampoline jumping is a relief in this regard.
The path of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects, as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then back up again without effort.
There is no competition, and of course no difficulty, but there is no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no measurement of distance, but only a perfect, graceful stretch of time and gravity.
This is as close as the Olympics and Zen are gonna get.
The women's qualifying and finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 1pm Eastern, with the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of the afternoon block, which begins at 2 p.m. both days.
Amidst the Olympic madness, they promise a peaceful, pleasant moment that you're likely to miss in other fights.
And if attention is to be gained only by giving male athletes the romantic gaze and materialization that the Wall Street Journal recently suggested the US gymnasts are doing, then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to take their breath away.
Protesting generation in Ethiopia, longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent government opposition.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the last decade, it's been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest that is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say police officers shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
In circulating video footage of the protests, which probably dates from late last year or early this year, security forces are seen beating young people with clubs after they were forced to stand on their hands against a wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and to take a step forward will be even more difficult", said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, are getting such help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy was growing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - a new commuter train even runs in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia is hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations have been talking about government repression incessantly - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were expelled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
That may change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there is a breakthrough", said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.
There are many complaints, ranging from land disputes to the absolute control of power by the ruling coalition.
After last year's widely criticized election, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition-held seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting on the border with Eritrea, where a conflict along this ill-defined, disputed border in June claimed hundreds of lives.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the chaos and rearm.
There are several factors that explain why, now, after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social networks only in recent years, when cheaper smartphones became widely available and Internet services improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly done during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians have spoken about how they gathered for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromo and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and the Amharas are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhara, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and commerce, and have exploited the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on the way to a united leadership", said Mulatu Gemech, the Oromo leader.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amhara and Oromo people believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, commerce and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see beyond the corner.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using envoys to manipulate opponents and win them over.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge", said Abdi, an analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been pulled out of relative obscurity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, when thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government rigged and then stole.
A heavy crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - though fewer than in previous months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and measurable progress in fighting poverty.
Clearly, however, the gradual buildup of conflict within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there's a dangerous ethnic formation going on.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigray-owned businesses, and anti-Tigray sentiment on social media is growing.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The U.S. government has been using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to promote democracy, it also does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile region.
"That", said Abdi, "is a very sharp point of the blade".
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as sarcasm
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy that has plagued his campaign by saying he didn't mean it when he repeatedly insisted this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also embarrasses his supporters, who have defended him vigorously in a time of turmoil, and has to explain that he may not have meant what he said.
After this proposal at a meeting Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he did not actually intend to say that the president and Clinton created IS.
However, in a Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was only being sarcastic.
The post was in contrast to the claim of a one-day-old, where Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his tone by reminding him that Obama was pushing to destroy ISIS, the Republican nominee for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has tried to focus his campaign's attention on the economy while his preferences in the election polls are falling.
Trump and Clinton fought an economic duel in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and said that some thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
In late July, when he received a wave of criticism when he came out with a suggestion that the Russians should hack into Clinton's emails, his comment was later explained by the words: "I'm obviously being sarcastic".
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which certain messages have a response from his supporters, to see how they react, and then, depending on the reaction, in one way or another, to give an explanation", said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who tracked the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's very clever in his statements and knows they're vague enough to be explained differently.
With polling numbers continuing to fall in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more prickly tone in recent days, rather than softening things up for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday shows that Tump is well behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump has tried to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, who must publicly stand behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is a legitimate political comment", Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little, almost unknown organization that he was completely mistaken for a newcomer, and that was because he had pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Clinton as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to tweet around him, setting the media on fire for passing on his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the pathetic TV pundits trying to understand him and said, "They can't do that!"
Several Democrats have slammed Trump's apology, saying it's just further proof that he's unfit for the presidency.
The cafe was pushed out of the market, and now it's back in Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe was a shitty place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, no Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie, a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014, sells cake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel looted and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, then it's also rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there, and it's a similar, humble atmosphere.
The coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbo is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for a move, he said he would gladly do so.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model espresso machine.
He even reused the old Verbo lighting.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new ingredients.
On offer are ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and topping dishes such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but will offer you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original press guests.
"A number of the original customers had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices", he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers was here, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and was a frequent visitor to the Verb Cafe.
It was even coming after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out what I like is coffee and culture in Verbu", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but that day she had mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a devoted member of the Verbs since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"I come here every day at four-five eight, like clockwork, and they're already making me my sausage with everything and butter", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order his usual stuff, but occasionally he has bacon, eggs and ham on his sausage.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry the soap store took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use the filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it", Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the cafe.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to display it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe could expand into the adjacent building.
A lot of customers just want their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and he said it broke his heart when the cafe closed.
Mr. Whitt says that since the cafe reopened, coming in for a cup of coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell", he said.
Depressing food from the Depression - at Square Meal
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Office having lunch.
The lavish President Roosevelt enjoyed a selection of Fifth Avenue dishes, such as goose liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devil's eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and a dessert of plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered", Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights, they're into food history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane's book, "97 Orchard", tells the story of a Lower East Side apartment house through food.
Their new collaborative work, A Square Meal, to be published by Harper Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their cooking solidarity and met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, strict buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the Depression, 1929.
Jane, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwiches, and Andrew, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was a perfect fit for a conversation about food during the crisis.
"The carnations were very popular", said Miss Ziegelman.
They sold peanut, liver, and bean curd.
They were made from the same ingredients and other cheap foods that she set the ingredients for.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe is a little bit of a wimp.
"They'd be in your stomach like lead", he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet of what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked cakes were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal follows the ways in which a nation coped with the sudden change from a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people", Coe said when explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: It spread mysterious foods like caraway and casserole dishes, casseroles as a "wonderful way to use up leftovers", Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the centerpiece of the American diet - has become a sparingly allocated luxury.
The strange mixtures that were supposed to serve as calorie and nutritional fillings were preferred to taste or even common sense in cooking.
While researching a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a seasonal dish of roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table", said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal".
Peanut butter and roasted onions don't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
More than ever before or since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of the Home Economy from 1923 to 1943 - have been driving the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraged women to take on the burdens of the budget, and turned snacks like cream spaghetti and carrots into delicious meals.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic delicacies.
In particular, desserts were created in response to the government's hunger for its citizens, such as the "I want cake" pose by President Herbert Hoover.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his childhood, he dined like the chosen millionaire he had become.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce", said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in a nearly clean room, wearing a tuxedo.
It was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him follow the example of his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste at all, and as a result, the White House not only served the most disgusting food in all of Washington, but also the most unpleasantly prepared.
Many of the eating habits of the Depression were gone as the country got back on its feet.
The message has remained in our continual exploration of calories and nutritional values, Ms. Ziegelman says, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they got a better understanding of Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - like why she couldn't throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food", Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She was a bad person".
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clear, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum cream", Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes fancy names.
There was no cream, just some plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the thick brown matter.
It was surprisingly bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more.
And he said to his wife, "Should we have some chopped hair?"
Europeans: Migrants are going for their allowances.
Most of the refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what a TV show would look like if we made it.
A group of Russian artists called 2D Among Us, making fun of their native country.
He uses Photoshop to create collages that humorously show what it would be like if famous TV shows and movies were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal fees in the patent case against C-type jaundice against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. was entitled to recover the legal fees it had incurred in the patent-related case against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. for yellow fever type C.
In June, a judgment ordering Gilead to pay $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was overturned after a federal judge found repeatedly unlawful conduct on Merck's part, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a filing Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of the fees incurred in connection with representing the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to own the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed military forces claim to have taken full control of Manbij city
US-backed military forces have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the city after the remnants of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city have left.
The units have freed more than 2,000 civilians detained by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, stating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had revenues of $10.75 million that year and paid 34.2 percent in actual taxes.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in lecture fees to the joint fund, and the former Secretary of State admitted to receiving $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her work at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be the models of financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's campaign aide, in a statement.
Donald Trump, by contrast, is hiding behind false excuses and backing away from his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It's customary for candidates for president of the United States to release their tax returns, even if the law doesn't require them to.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move", said Hillary Clinton's campaign aide on Twitter, following the Democratic nominee's tax return.
Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audits were complete.
According to Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican Party members, his rejection raises questions about his net worth, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relationships, including his relationship with Russia.
Clinton has been vocal on the issue, releasing a video Friday reminding high-ranking Republicans of Trump's urging him to release his tax returns.
He's gonna bring it up in his speech on economic issues at Michigan State on Thursday.
"He refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades - release their tax returns", she said in front of the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very low taxes for the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying that may be the case today.
Federal tax rates became a topic in the presidential election.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone earning more than $1 million a year pays a minimum tax rate of 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, home of Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, Buffet urged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also audited the IRS and that Trump is "not afraid of the Treasury Department, but the voters".
Clinton's campaign released tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent federal income tax and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they make just $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual fund, which they reported to Clinton as having $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from entering human habitations - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This has worked, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting this practice and training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use this four-step nonviolent approach to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since they developed this... toolkit, we've seen a change in behavior in these communities, where people are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them", Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light a flashlight and sound the horn for the passing elephant.
If he doesn't, he'll be thrown out of the so-called "chilli box".
The chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom with the firecracker, the end of which is sealed so that only the knot is visible.
After the explosion, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chili is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one blast and the elephant goes the other way.
The last option is to fire a firecracker, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans into Berlin hotel for removing code to call Israel at Arabs' request - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a media sensation after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have the Israeli dialing code listed, according to an employee, at the "request" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary film Shoah, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel's dialing code list.
However, the country was not listed among those countries that can be called directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
It was written by Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers the option of calling Israel through its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and contacted the hotel reception with a problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, "shocked me".
The hotel employee replied that the measure had been 'decided after consultation with the management of Kempinski Hotels'.
The reason for this move was further encouraged by the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the Israel calling code be deleted", Lanzmann quoted the employee in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a great shame".
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
It's a shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and, moreover, in a hotel chain like this, is even more shameful.
No further explanation is necessary.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, he said.
The incident sparked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply got lost in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you" is mentioned in another post, which points out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to the newspaper Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the event "oversight" and apologizing to Lanzman.
"There was never a direct order to exclude Israel from the call code list", the Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a Kempinski hotel representative as saying.
He adds that the code for the call has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, as students gathered to demonstrate against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement attempted to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals made by the governor of the state of San Paulo, Gerald Alckmin, to save money, is the closure of almost 100 public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were seen spraying on the walls signs against interim president Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in mass support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff after the country's senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 percent - RT Business
According to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year since the lifting of sanctions.
As the ambassador stated, since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expanding trade is of course one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, Dzhagaryan said.
The Commission also noted that the Russian Federation's exporting producers have been able to export to the Union during the first five months of 2016 and that the exporting producers have been able to export to the Union during the first five months of 2016.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade was secured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons, the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran has entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be surpassed, he said.
But at the same time, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians, and the ambassador hopes that this will change.
"I personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the ancient Persian civilization is well preserved", he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner rushing home after the British won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland was inducted into the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome as the trio of the British team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was the brake, taken by Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend delighted when he came to the finish line and stole the victory from the favourite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the track cycling world championships in March, even though Hoy had meanwhile ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist starting rider Jamie Staff.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
After Hoye's departure, there was also a vacancy that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man of the British coaches and the search for potential was now confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was the joint champion with Hoye four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the jersey was taken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up.
Hoy watched the race from his position as BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped onto the stage, he kept his eyes on them.
"It's a flattering comparison", said Skinner, 23, a native of Glasgow.
I'm here to do my best and do my name justice.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen off the track after a poor start.
The memo was later withdrawn and the British rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time around, there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London".
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We've lost a lot of world championships, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If that's a measure of progress over the past five months, then we're looking at five successful days at the aerodrome.
With the form Kenny has shown, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same Olympics.
That would mean a total of six gold medals and one silver for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, and also has a birthday on March 23 (a date that seems to be sacred to British sport, as Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrate their birthdays on this day).
Whatever Hoy got.
Kenny's next race is the sprint, which starts today and runs for the next three days.
A 28-year-old Bolton native said, "I'm enjoying this one now.
Team racing is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull have qualified as the fastest for the four-kilometer team pursuit.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (22:42) are on today's second day of the race, which Wiggins will definitely be focusing on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioner when the referee asked him to measure his height.
In a similar women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team VB relied on their strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-Olympic period and won many medals.
After truly exceptional performances, proving to be outstanding in Beijing and London, expectations were lowered during the preparations for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events have unfolded, not least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of greats like Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the velodrome races proves, it seems that the legendary reputation of the Great Britain team being able to deliver a top performance with perfect timing could be confirmed once again.
The uncertain future of the Portland tavern after the termination of the power supply contract
The future of the Portland Aluminum Works in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because the power plant that supplies the business with electricity has informed one of the owners of the works about its intention to terminate the power supply contract.
This follows the decision by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to extend the granting of grants to keep the business running.
The fixed 20 year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa Portland may be at risk.
If closed, up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly.
And because the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the electricity generated in Victoria, there could be more avalanche impacts.
Alcoa shut down Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa tavern in Portland is running out of time and is in danger of closing.
This follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the plant's production prices.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said that it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The plant is majority owned by the Alcoa and Alumina joint venture, with small commercial shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, in other words, high demand for electricity from the mill will continue, she said.
The Commission notes that the AGL's activities are not limited to the provision of services to the general public.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
AGL continues to expect that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the financial year 2017, the power plant stated.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
AGL stated that it had already recorded the value of the contracts in its books at $187 million in case of termination.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract had no impact on its ... ability to operate the smelter or to ensure the supply of electricity to the smelter.
The US company said that it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to start in November of this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
AGL's chief operating officer, Stehpen Mikkelsen, who spoke to analysts earlier this week, said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies withdrew from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It wouldn't be good for us as a producer, he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian reality TV show - she's now the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's mother-manager, appeared on the cover of the September issue of American Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who has been showcasing at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page", Kendall wrote.
The cover reveal was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the Kardashian humor?) staged video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar rioters Rob and Caitly and with them all, their favorite uncle from show business, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister on the cover, only to have the scene end with a classic twist: they're preparing a secret party.
It's a rounded storyline for almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show, but Kris needed to make sure that the other girls in this commercial could get their act together.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue, we've definitely entered a new era of the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue's title is a different league.
The July issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which is more like a book for advertising than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that last year's issue had 615 pages of advertising content out of 832).
The reveal of the star that will appear on the cover is eagerly anticipated, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrity models" on the cover than "celebrity models".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence made the cover in 2013, and Gaga took the honor a year later.
But while it's highly unlikely that Kendall - who the magazine describes as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids today who know how to make a good cut video (although Jenner represents all of that).
They're demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who made the cover last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, former Victoria's Secret model, in June criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
Those feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you make-up by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.

Community legal aid centers reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160 000 most vulnerable citizens are turned away from community legal aid centres each year, and the sector itself is preparing for the impact of further restrictions on funding for already overburdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and people without the financial means to fight unjust evictions and the like - are rejected as soon as they seek free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, already so tense to burst, are about to make further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Community Legal Aid Centers in Queensland, said that the latest summary report from the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers found that 5,000 people are turned away each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the federal government's decision reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are denied the vital services they need", he said.
People who have escaped from abusive relationships, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers being unfairly dismissed - all these people are having problems with the legal dimensions, and this report shows that they are not in a position to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which will result in thousands more at-risk Queenslanders having to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on the state's attorney and Queensland senator George Brandis to stop this funding cut immediately so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Last year, the State Government received a commitment to provide legal aid funding up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and the communities of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit against Donald Trump's campaign after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun at the president's office.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after being told that the North Carolina director of operations pointed a gun at a staff member while riding a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court filing handed down Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that it would not.
Director Earl Phillip pointed his fingers at the gun, put the right hand on the trigger, and pointed the warhead at Vincent's head, Bordini said in the indictment.
The file says that Bordini, after complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, found out that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Weapons don't have to fire to cause damage", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir by telling voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gun owners (which is a Second Amendment right in the US) could step in if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can appoint her own judge.
Trump's campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
Bordini's lawsuit seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of force and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get Philip to express himself have been unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news outlet in Charlotte, has announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services went unanswered in a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division of the County of Mecklenburg (Charlotta).
Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not just for our local communities and across London, but for the whole country.
For me, Heathrow is a tremendous attraction, just like London in 2012, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics have been a huge benefit to both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses in the vicinity of Heathrow.
We're going to create 10,000 new training jobs, 40,000 new jobs for our local communities alone, and we're going to end youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be a laughing stock on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and in the case of Heathrow, they'll be proven wrong.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have put in place an 11 billion pound infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, starting with Terminal T5 - voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row, to Terminal T2 which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They're now ready to deliver a third runway, costing £16 billion in private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK, and I'm confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be too.
It's time we continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future and leave a legacy of skills and jobs Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the cat and mouse game of ad blocking
Trying to bypass ad-blocking programs has become a cat-and-mouse game for companies that make money from online marketing, at least according to one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website saying users could update filters in their app and re-block ads on the social network.
Facebook said Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it harder for ad filters to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says they've already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this sort of war between the open source ad blocking community and those who try to bypass it has been going on since ad blocking was invented", and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix of its own.
The fact that the company that owns the world's largest social network got involved in the war just proves how big of a problem ad blocking has become for the industry.
According to a study done last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad filters - almost four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesperson stated that the company is, however, against ad filters on desktops because mobile ad filters on mobile apps for social networking and Instagram do not work.
Desktop ads are still profitable enough for Facebook to invest in them.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people more control over how ads are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said it was concerned about the new Adblock filters, which could also block non-advertising content on the site.
"It's not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blocking is a sensitive tool, so we've focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident where a woman was hit by several cars on the highway in the early hours of Thursday morning, possibly in an attempt to commit suicide.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Tuesday.
Vaud police said in a statement that the "desperate" actress was lying in the dark on the road and was hit by several cars.
It's clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, tried to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have been questioned, but police say they have not been identified yet, and they are asking those drivers and anyone else who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a logical step in a situation like this, said Le Tribune de Geneva lawyer Gilles Hofstetter.
It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was the collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecution has to find out, Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the last five years, it seems that the drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases - one involving a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of negligent homicide after she crashed and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, at age 22, drank alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the distress call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a favorite destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (ACCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
This was announced by the Executive Director of AČCKA, Katerina Petříčková, on Friday.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on 8 August, the festival brings the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people closer together.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended.
"Prague is among the most popular destinations for the LGBT community, due to its high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses", Petříčková said.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign visitors spend an average of CZK 3,100 per person per day.
Special maps of Prague are available to gay tourists to support their travels with a complete list of Prague's gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, interested in stays in higher-priced sections with a high standard of tourism services and spending more than others", Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also taking place this year.
It is attended by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
This year's theme is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade with allegorical carriages, which will start from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The march, which has drawn thousands in previous years, will this year mark a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where a gunman shot and killed 49 people, mostly gays.
Pat and Mat are celebrating 40 years.
The irresistible cartoons Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained audiences of all ages for forty years.
The pilot episode of this nightly series directed by Lubomir Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
The animated series, now known to audiences in more than 100 countries, was inspired by the jokes drawn by the artist and director Lubomir Beneš, who created them for the magazine with two cute men, Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the playwright Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimir Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
The current form with yellow and red tricks and a ball and radio receives the characters in 1979, when the short film Prague began to be created a series for Slovak television.
Pat and Mat were given the names in 1985, this time for the short film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own animation studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, further works were continued with other creators, many of them with Benes' son Marek.
There are now over 90 episodes of stories of these cuddlers, who get everything under their fingers, but never get angry at themselves, and are always full of optimism, ideas and cuddly enthusiasm, and in the end are satisfied with their work, which they prove with the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Matt have even moved from the television screens to books, DVDs, and theater, and characters or other toys with Pat and Matt in them are a hit in every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the fairy tale sign, we've chosen one for you from sports and one from life.
Both have good endings.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved a historic achievement.
What is the cause of joy for the whole land?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what do people spend the most on at airports?
That's the Friday snapshot of the world wide web.
The first Olympic medals.
A historic achievement is celebrated by the island nation of Fiji.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the Great Britain team in the final of the Olympic rugby sevens tournament.
This is the first medal Fiji has ever won at the Olympics.
The wait for the first precious metal to be found has been 60 years since the first Olympic Games expedition was sent.
A lot of credit goes to the Fiji coach.
But the irony is, he's British Ben Ryan.
The team has been in the lead since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen he could be happy unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play it easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history", the coach declared before the final.
Fiji eventually took it over, and the tiny state of 900,000 people is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The French newspaper Le Monde reported the news.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me", a two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her dolls' arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis less than a year old, and doctors gave her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing about her I don't love.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He's got a vision.
I saw her introduce herself to the other kids with the words, "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have arms", the mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN reports that people spend the most money at airports on bottled water.
Hudson's Travel Essentials has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers most frequently buy at its stores at airports.
Water was first.
The drinks were generally very popular, with eight of them ranking in the top ten.
Ninth place went to a large box of coconut-flavored M&M's.
And can you guess who's closing in on the top ten?
It's the only one of the above that can't be eaten.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times, USA Today.
Among them are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Sovereign of the Sailing.
We're just going to win, they were laughing Murray and Bond.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have dominated the two-man class for seven years, and they have also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
The seemingly incompatible pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
At the Lagoon Rodrigo de Freitas, they claimed their 69th consecutive win in the quarterfinals on Thursday.
What makes us different?
We're just prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta when he was asked about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We just train hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly 6-foot, 100-pound chaser, while the academically-looking Bond is five inches shorter and 15 pounds lighter.
And they're also different in nature.
Bond is studying and doing finance, Murray's done charity boxing.
They don't spend much time together outside of rowing, either.
Eric's getting on board with basically the idea that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, Bond admitted, who even made it clear at the press conference that Murray was the dominant member of the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
But on the water, they destroy their opponents with their calm power.
They are running at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead halfway through the race, their opponents have yet to find a recipe for accelerating them.
We're racing on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to do the first mile all the time.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
"We know what we have to do to win", said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the Golden Four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to the two-man without a steering wheel.
At the London Olympics, they may have made up for the biggest defeat of their careers, and they confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and they didn't ask us anything.
It was a little more fun this time.
"We knew it was going to be hell, and we had to make sure we were mentally fit", Murray said.
We know they're all trying to overthrow us.
We're still on target.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model projections, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions on Venus, once hot, waterless, and saturated with CO2, could have been similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' low rotational speed can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth, yet it was spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but it once had enough water and geological diversity to sustain life and provide protection from rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus, during its slow rotation, exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time", explains GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats the surface and creates rain, which forms a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and shield the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than those on Earth today.
The model compiled a story of Venus-like evolution that had previously been hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from a new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing his inability to participate in the decision-making process on team matters.
Colorado's executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"I've spent the last three years as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination", 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I've spent years thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and take it to the next level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organisation.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who took over from Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today", Sakic said.
We appreciate all he's done for our organization, and we wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013/2014.
He led the team to a 112 point lead and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and he's missed every postseason game in the last two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season 39:39-4 and were five points short of their second wild card in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame quarterback Roy won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers at the North Sea oil rig resume talks and break strike
The top negotiators said that the strike on the salaries of the North Sea oil platform workers was suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have sporadically taken place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current disagreements", the statement said.
Starting next week, we're going to have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks where we're going to try to look at the issues from a new angle.
According to the unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is to protest the wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced tariffs and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less this year due to negative market pressures.
The reduction in company rates follows the 10% reduction for shore-based companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give the companies room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation linked to Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of a generation leading to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just some", he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016 almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler is measuring the rotation speed of the stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain a nearly complete list of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data help astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a new report.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching their adult stage, having formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it's turning the fastest.
At times of maximum rotational velocity, these emerging stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds travel along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation rate slows down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by measuring the time between discovering distinct points on the stars -- like sunspots.
According to the latest data on the rotation rates, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones making pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades ballet, we see that the slowest-spinning stars are the most massive, while the fastest-spinning ones are usually very light", said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and their rotational velocities.
"The Pleiades provide an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, for both young and old stars", said Rebull.
There's still a lot to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation, so to speak, hanging their dancing shoes on nails.
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed the latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Pleiades in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement wouldn't be finalized, and after a few months, I could transfer to another hospital?
Is it possible to work after graduation without having taken a specialised course?
I mean, the field I'd like to work in, there's a job opening right now at a hospital a little bit further away, but in about six months, there could be a job opening at another one where I'd like to work.
So I don't know how to handle the situation for about six months, the question goes on.
This is Bishop Lenka Wolkowa.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A training agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee's qualifications.
In the health sector, however, there is a long-term pressure not to conclude such agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare workers, and not all hospitals currently require such an agreement.
However, under Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising the professional and specialised qualifications for the professions of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly stated that participation in specialised training is considered to be a deepening of the qualification (rather than an increase).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded under the Labour Code if the costs amount to at least CZK 75 000.
There is no legal requirement to take up specialised training.
The law only specifies the conditions for applying for specialised training.
However, the law allows a doctor to practise medicine only if he has completed the necessary higher education, under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialised qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional experience in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialist training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the applicant's situation.
However, given that I do not know the details of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health provides by law a consultancy and advisory service related to the admission to and the course of specialised education.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides free advice, and every doctor must be a member.
Doctors in Syria's Halab are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (of the rebel parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, AFP quoted a letter to the White House as saying.
"We don't need tears, compassion, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again", the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the military loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop their strikes in the Halab area for three hours every day from today to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CET, all military activity, air strikes and artillery fire shall be stopped.
While UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, he stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, Obama was contacted in the letter by 15 of the 35 doctors working in the rebel-held eastern part of Halab.
He writes that during the five years of the war, they witnessed the violent, brutal deaths of countless patients, friends, and colleagues.
The world is watching and realizing how complicated Syria is, but it's doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like slightly disguised threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors have pointed out.
Doctors said there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, 15 of which were on hospitals where they work.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have small children coming to the ER with injuries so severe that we have to choose the ones that are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the materials to help them, the doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns drowned when an explosion cut off the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They were gasping for breath and then their life ended - before it could really begin, they recalled.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people inside without food supplies.
The rebels, under constant Russian and Syrian air strikes, managed to break through the siege on Saturday after three weeks and launch a counter-offensive.
Then the two parties increased in the city and strengthened the surroundings.
