Askar Tokpanov: I saw you on the TV.
It's not bad.
He said, Go deeper still, and be careful, and be not distracted.
He recited all the poems of Abai.
I also read a lot of waves, including poems by Abai and Muqaali.
I read it over and over again.
You will remember what you have read.
When I was young, my memory was strong, and my understanding was quick.
Today, all of this is my treasure.
I'm a very easygoing person, and I can talk to anyone.
And my soul shall be moved with compassion for them that mourn for their name.
That's a blessing!

This elevator was a Soviet-era structure that was not needed in the 1990s.
The company "Elevator Agrofood" has restored the old one and now it is able to store and sell high-quality wheat of 30 grams of dough, which is grown in the Torgai region.
The wheat of our region is of interest to China, Arabs and Russia.
In the near future, we will install a large German mill with a capacity of 70 tons of flour per day, and we will employ another 10-15 people.
We thought that we could even increase our wages.
Today, 22 people work in the elevator.
We have increased the salary of 5-6 people who receive 32-33 thousand tenge per month.
This is just a basic salary.
The work in agriculture is not counted as time, sometimes extra work is paid per hour, "said Kurman Abdrahman, executive director of the elevator.
The company "Elevator Agrofood" is committed to further developing the quality of storage and processing of durum wheat.

The massacre of the Soviet Red Army in all cities and settlements of Kazakhstan to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol is a crime against our country.
This means that first of all, the Komsomol - the Independence of the Kazakh Country.
Yesterday, the news went out that in the city of Semey, the golden cradle of the Kazakh statehood , the followers of the red jendets, initiated by Nurlan Omarov, celebrated the 100th anniversary of the red jendets with all their strength.
I also saw on the Internet that there were red pioneers in Kazakhstan wearing red ties in schools, and I was very upset.
Now I see that these Russian slaves, that is, the unborn slaves, have started to openly poison the minds of young Kazakh generations, and I can't find a word for these bastards ...
How can we understand that these Komsomol people are the slaves of Russia, who have seized the Independence of Kazakhstan?
Oh, what a shame, the name of the slave is slave!
Ana Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanovs - their acknowledgment that they are in fact the obedient slaves of the colonialists, their open declaration of "unbounded love" for Russia - should be understood first of all as the open recognition of the Russia of today, which the followers of the red jendets of yesterday still claim to have left behind.
In 1986 the current "eternal deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aytymova, in the famous December of 1986, one of them openly criticized and mourned D.Konaev, who raised him in office, Gennady Kolbin, and now one of them said: "Comrade Kolbin, I will bring him and punish him for pulling his cock out of his hair", wrote a paper about the same national tragedy called "Zobalañ" and made a radio play on Radio Azadikaty in Munich in 1990, as the author of the famous work "Jumashy, the white motherbirds and the red-haired women", which made world waves.
The Kazakh people, who were tired of their own trickery, did not forget!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as the first-born of my nation of Kazakh origin, I openly condemn the followers of these red jendets!
If our state is truly an independent state, I declare that the day has come when the eternal president of this state will publicly punish or condemn all those who openly threaten the Independence of Kazakhstan as traitors to the state.
"My country, my country, my people" (Abay), this was the moment when the whole country openly condemned the Komsomolists.
Awake, O death, for thou art no more asleep, for the past shall not delay thee.
I will never forget that!
India has started a cleaner air campaign.
In India, the air is being purified with artificial rain technology.
This project will be implemented first in Delhi.

This will help to remove the smoke that has been smoldering in Delhi and reduce the amount of harmful waste in the air.
The burning of wheat stalks by farmers in the autumn after harvesting is a major cause of air pollution.
And a man of the place spoke to him, saying, Behold, the air is foul, and the smoke is all morning.
You can't even open your eyes.
The children are not going to school.
I went out into the open field, and my soul was in a deep sleep, and my eyes were opened.
"I had to walk a little to get around town and then return to the hotel.
The air is dirty and it is difficult to breathe.
I remembered the clean air in my home country and the work that was being done in Australia.

The III International Student Film Festival " Baстау " has started in Almaty .
This year's festival is chaired by the famous director, screenwriter, educator Irakliy Kvirikadze.
The jury included Sylvan Kutandin ("Letter to Stalin"), Russian actress Elvira Bolgova ("My Armenian Wedding", "The Ugly Daughter"), Kyrgyz director Temirbek Birnazaraov and Kazakh writer Sabit Kurmanbekov.
Along with the main jury, the jury consisting of young cinematographer-students will work as per the tradition of the "Bastada" year.
This year's student jury includes students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia.
The Spanish director Yago Mateo Velasco, who won the competition just two years ago, is now the chairman of the jury, which will judge the work of talented students.
There are many film festivals in the world, but "Bastauta" is the festival that really makes a good start.
The fact that the festival is international is good for students, and we get a little bit of a glimpse of what the future of cinema can hold.
And of course, there's the Oscars, there's the Cannes Film Festival, but you can't go there right away, so it's nice to have a stepping stone like the Beginning that leads to the big contests.
The most important thing is literacy, a new way of looking at the world, and we want to open the way to the world of big festivals for young, unknown talents", says Mato Velasco.
The festival was attended by Kim Yen Du, Dean of the Faculty of Film Production at Korea University of Media Arts, Marina Nigmatulina, Sound Director of Mosfilm, and Eugene Filippov, a cinematographer and lecturer at the University of Karpenko-Karogo in Ukraine.
The jury and festival guests will hold creative meetings and master classes with alumni of Almaty's cinematography school and film specialists.
All events of the festival, master classes will be held at the National Academy of Arts and the Turan University.
The venue of the international film festival is important for young people.
The student should see what competition is, not only what his fellow students are doing, but also how their peers in other countries are looking for.
The film is different from the festival, and the interaction with the filmmakers, the exchange of ideas is even different.
"Start" is a crucial step in creating a creative relationship.
Despite the complexities, the difficulties of moving to the big screen, cinema continues to evolve.
Film festivals are also very important for this purpose.
Cinema is a collaborative work, international cinema is universal, and we contribute to its development.
The festival is not just about watching movies, but also learning how to make them, said the festival president Sergey Azimov.
According to the organizers, the festival of student films, which was discontinued during the Soviet era, has continued during the independence period and is being held for the 7th time this year.
Despite the difficulties, the festival has managed to attract the interest of the film community.

The Russian market is interested in Kazakhstan's halal products.
They put agricultural products and food, food products.
The company "Zlak+ M" has been producing pasta products since 1999.
Their products, which are popular in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, have now reached the Russian market.
Our products are halal, and they are attracting the interest of consumers.
The exhibition was well organized, but we didn't see many competing pasta producers, but the exhibition space is always useful.
We met with a few companies who gave us good reviews.
The townspeople often came to ask us to sell the products we brought to the exhibition.
The company's sales manager, Peter Shaulsky, said that all products from Kazakhstan received a lot of requests.
Even before the exhibition began, the people of Chelyabinsk were waiting in line to buy Kazakh goods.
The milk plant " DEP " in Kostanay has been known in the Chelyabinsk market for many years.
According to the representative of the plant Vadim Yamalauddinov, the firm had to transport its products to the two-day exhibition several times.
The products of local producers are expensive in the Chelyabinsk market, but our products are of the same quality.
We sold milk at the exhibition at the producer price, which is sure to be very popular with customers.
The main thing is that the customers have come to see that our products are natural, that the milk is not powdered, but real milk.
Many people asked me, "How can I find your product in the region?"
"DEP is working hard to cover the entire market of the Chelyabinsk region, and then we will go to Yekaterinburg", Vadym Yamaluddinov said.
Do not be deceived.
For the mouth of the foolish is full of deceit.
Now they are using the power of social media to make money in an easy way.
Recently, the police in Astana arrested a 23-year-old man from Taraz, suspected of online fraud.

To attract attention, he advertised for less than the market price of leather.
The girls, who were aware that the sun was setting and that the delicate creatures were attracted to the shades of their skin, sent pictures of girls in various shades of beautiful colors and even showed them to the addresses of the stores.
He was so determined to be a voice that he used to write to his "clients" on WhatsApp to avoid being recognized by the world.
He promises to deliver tons of goods to customers, which is what he does.
And they ask for 100 percent of the money to be transferred to the Qiwi wallet in advance.
Oh, my God!
The people who believed the story of the unknown person transferred from 100 to 300 thousand tenge to the fraudsters' accounts.
So he cheated seven people of the capital and got 1.5 million tenge in the morning.
"It's over, it's over", he says, and then he counts the money, and he locks his account, and he closes his account.
But the scheme of the cunning man will not succeed.
The wise law officers followed him and put him in chains.

Archimed Mukhambetov on the transformation of Kostanay region into Torgai .
Akim of Kostanay region Arhimed Mukhambetov expressed his opinion on the initiative to rename the Kostanay region as Torgai region .
At a briefing in Astana today , a question was asked about the open letter of the initiative group on changing the name of the region .
I'm familiar with the letter.
I saw it.
I'm generally against it.
The name of Kostanay region is historical.
If I am not mistaken, this letter was signed by 17 people.
I know a few people.
When I spoke to them personally, a man named Sabirzhan Akhmetovich, who was the mayor of many districts, refused to sign the letter.
He also said that he did not sign the letter.
I think that it is not appropriate to panic the population here, " said Archimed Mukhambetov.

So, we'll see.
But let me tell you my general position.
We have a district center that has been established for a long time, called Torgai.
If in the thirties and forties the name of Kostanay was Torgai, then it is better to work on restoring the old name.

If we say 2,200 years, let's call it that, let's start there.
But it is necessary to prove it , " Nursultan Nazarbayev noted .
It should be noted that during the meeting the President of Kazakhstan outlined the specific directions of development of Shymkent.
The rules of combating "black archaeology" are approved.
After the Black Archaeologists, the monuments are being destroyed and left open.
This was announced by Minister of Culture and Sports Arstanbek Mukhamediuly during the presentation of the draft law " On protection and use of historical and cultural heritage objects " in the Majilis .
The issue of regulating archaeological and restoration works on historical and cultural heritage sites requires a review.
It is no secret that our unique monuments or unexplored objects are often searched and excavated by "black archaeologists", after which the monuments are left open and partially or completely destroyed.
In addition, there are also situations where intensive construction works carried out on adjacent territories of historical and cultural heritage objects have a significant impact on the historical integrity and preservation of historical and cultural monuments, leading to negative consequences.
In general, there is a need to strengthen the legal framework, which requires a clear regulation and create favorable conditions for the protection and use of historical and cultural heritage objects, - the minister stressed.
According to him, at the legislative level, it is envisaged to establish the procedure for identification and registration of historical and cultural heritage objects, as well as monitoring their condition, and to introduce new qualitative mechanisms for preserving and using historical heritage objects in their final historical appearance .
In addition, it is proposed to establish rules and conditions for conducting archaeological works and combating "black archaeology", regulate the legal regime of land use in protected areas, construction of historical and cultural monuments, determine the legal regime of use of natural landscape areas.
The draft law was developed with the study of international experience.
For example, Russian legislation includes measures to combat "black archaeology" for illegal archaeological searches, destruction of archaeological objects, avoidance of the transfer of artifacts to the state and others.
In other words, criminal liability is provided.
In Italy, there are obligations for private collectors at the legislative level.
According to them, it is planned to create and periodically update lists of objects of cultural and artistic interest and private property.
In addition , the objects in the property of the owners of these facilities are subject to state protection , regardless of their nationality , citizenship , - said A. Mukhamediuly.

College leaders are deceiving the country and the government.
The Prosecutor's Office of the East Kazakhstan region has conducted a review of the activities of colleges in the region and identified numerous violations of the law, as well as unintended spending of budget funds.
In particular, there were cases of non-compliance with the competition procedures, false training of students, illegal granting of grants, failure of teachers to meet the qualification requirements, lack of provision of student dormitories, as well as illegal leasing of state property.

The administration of the college included costs for the services included in the total amount of the contract for the cost of student accommodation in the dormitories, renting rooms in the dormitories to third parties.
He lied to 12 students at a college in Cornwall.
Teachers and masters of industrial training evaluated these students in theoretical and practical study journals during the course of the course, sent them to interim certification, transferred them from one course to another.
In addition, scholarships were paid to these students and the total amount of damage to the state amounted to 8 million tenge.
A pre-trial investigation is underway.
The College has also identified illegal use of property for private purposes.
For example, a paid parking lot has been located on the territory of the East Kazakhstan Regional Art School named after the brothers Abdulinders.
After the introduction of the Prosecutor's recommendation, the parking lot is planned to be closed and a sports field will be built in its place.
According to the results of the investigation , prosecutors have determined damages of more than 43 million tenge .
According to the supervisory acts , 36 million tenge have been recovered to date .
