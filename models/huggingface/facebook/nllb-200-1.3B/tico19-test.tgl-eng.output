Rapidly increasing combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar targets in European Union/European Economic Area countries and in the United Kingdom which proves that, while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the arrival of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, and intensive care in particular.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases unknown to the field of aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Because, the disease resulting from the infection of SARS-CoV-2 is named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more serious illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases experience a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in the combined COVID-19 incidence in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and in the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries with Italy from 31 January- 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
Following China, COVID-19 is undergoing further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following those in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO definition of case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), where between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Taking the combined number and combined incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the declared COVID-19 case in every country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the countries' Ministries of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used for the assessment of COVID-19 targets in the EU/EEA and UK, and comparison with those in Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14 days of intermittent combined incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and UK, during the period 1 January  15 March 2020.
We also show the combined number of reported cases per country on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy in the period 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day non-consecutive trends of combined incidents of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK are generally following those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK on the half, the combined COVID-19 event started to rise around 21 February and then rose rapidly around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This is mostly behind the rapid rise in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown the same upward direction of the combined COVID-19 incidence.
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to Italy in the period 31 January  15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as of March 15 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in the previous 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rising rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The calculated targets for the combined incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, there are differences in national public health responses, and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to a hospital and/or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not disclosed).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to add to the current surveillance data focused on the number of registered cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 201011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and mid-care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a &gt; 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
As cases are currently concentrated by some regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a specific target population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be better prepared for use at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience in Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the scenario of long-term transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 requiring health care, and in particular intensive care, as is occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As stated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and respond appropriately if not implemented early.
The rapid risk assessment also listed public health measures to mitigate the strong impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity where countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
Failing this, it is likely that the health care systems of other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
Like its cousin, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transferred from bats and cause similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more elderly individuals than younger and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help us to understand and eliminate the dreaded disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday and for several weeks afterwards due to the spread of a new disease from the virus.
The virus bears a strong resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients being discharged and over 3,000 patients dying.
"WHO reminded that COVID-19 is ""public enemy number 1"" and possibly stronger than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including microbiology, epidemiology, origin, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that identified the sequence of the microbiome isolated in many patients.
This section seeks to bridge the research progress into a new and rapidly developing area of the subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by the CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and diagnosis as well as some remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered nonlethal pathogens in humans, primarily causing about 15% of the common influenza 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic CoV strains, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with alarming morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
After seven days, the CoV sequence is released.
On January 15, 2020 the first fatal case was reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infection was reported by health-care providers, suggesting human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public transportation suspended.
On January 24 the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan which is considered the source site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the spread of a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig. 2) .2). (Fig.2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the full extent and severity of the spread remains to be ascertained.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients showed a more up-to-date description of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BiUl-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but most commonly in the age group of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over 50 years of age, a little under 20, and only 14 infected individuals were younger than 10 years.
More men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000) were infected with SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 has spread rapidly mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 lasts an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average duration from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose exponentially before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass travel time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all the patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, where alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to be infectious to humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after copying the viral genome, the genomic RNA combined with the coiled glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing the virion, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV strain with more than 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequential samples collected from the original site of outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in extremely thin sections of the epithelium in the human airway.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is coupled with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the release of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not possess any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the entire human ACE2 at 2.9 A resolution with the amino acid transporter B0AT 1.
They discovered that the complex, with open and closed configurations, is assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a treatment target for drug synthesis to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The source and intermediate host
It has been found that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via mice and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the native host of SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be bats because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-affected CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which intermediate host helped the virus inherit the species' traits to infect humans, and the route of transmission has yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes as carriers of the virus from the jaws to humans involved in the re-creation of homologs within the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-beaked, bird-eating mammals commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology to a CoV detected in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a large difference; thus, conclusive results for concrete evidence are pending (Fig. (Fig. 33). (Fig.33).
The physicochemical components of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been determined in half.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to be heated to 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectant containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4) .4).
In general, after a virus has infected the host, it is first recognized by the host innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR) ), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus initiates the emergence of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to disappear from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes along with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill cells infected with the virus.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid the defense cells.
However, the CoV may inhibit T cell activity by initiating T cell death.
Angular immunity including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also important in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovered neutralised MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system creates a large number of free radicals in that area that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was characterized by early congestion, is more likely to affect adults with comorbidities and pregnant women.
People who have been exposed to large numbers of viruses or have compromised immune functions usually have a higher risk of infection than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, one study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is crucial for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period, to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from passing the virus on to others.
As a general rule, individuals exposed to, or infected with, the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be accompanied by asymptomatic or other symptoms such as dry cough, wheezing, muscle aches, nausea, headache, diarrhea, fluid buildup in the nose, chest pain, vomiting, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced nausea and/ or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progress rapidly to the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory and chronic fever symptoms, even without abnormalities in the lung image, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for wheezing, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and nausea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these require ventilation support, more than in COVID-19 patients and corresponding to a higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Fever (26%) and diarrhea (21%) were also noted in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), nausea (40%-42%), vomiting (20-25%), and diarrhoea (13-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 death toll was 2% as the confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is shown in Table of Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Compounding often occurs in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the past two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that the virus can survive in people without symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients discharged from hospitals may become re-infected, providing an alarm for extending the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or reduced peripheral white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of 4×109/L plus a lymphocyte count of 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, are elevated, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreases.
Chest radiography abnormalities are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, chronic lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid retention, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.
Misuse of type-I and type-II pneumocytes lowers the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Thus, the worst-case chest radiography often goes hand in hand with the most extreme edge of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first test of the COVID-19 disease-causing organism showed the spread of pneumocytes, formation of a powdery membrane, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary benchmark for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false-negative rates, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manipulations for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation has also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical tests, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and necessary in making an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, matching synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring a sophisticated instrument.
It is hoped that the new technique will provide remarkable sensitivity and comfort when tested on clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians may provide primary care support to COVID-19 patients; while testing various therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus-borne diseases (Hanayan (Hanayan2).2).(Table2).2).
These include current and potential treatments of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are at the forefront of developing antibodies and vaccines against microbes.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and is likely to also attack, at lower levels, other ACE2 expressing organs, such as the intestinal system and kidneys.
However, improper breathing and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, breathing support is critical to relieving symptoms and saving lives and along with general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of life-threatening cardiac arrest or respiratory failure.
Additionally, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been found that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release many free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used in the treatment of cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of the T cell-directed immune response; blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective treatment against the virus has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug that Gilead first developed for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential inhibition against other single stranded RNA viruses including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are largely expected.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with chronic respiratory symptoms.
Nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody production
The collection of blood from patients recovering from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the disease cause in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease-causing and other foreign substances and they recognize unique molecules in disease-causing and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with severe disease.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, refinement and clarification are needed to propose a path for large-scale use before particular therapies can be developed.
In addition, because of the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovering patients and identify the genetic codes of effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against vital viral proteins.
In this way, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend primarily on a combination of many ingredients in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most active ingredients remain vague or vague because it is difficult to pick up and market said ingredients or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those recovering from severe episodes.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
Top cure rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in an estimated 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
This comparison is somewhat harsh, however, since many other factors of strong impact such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine (WM) alone to the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the times required for body temperature recovery, symptom relief, and hospitalization were significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most strikingly, the number of symptomatic exacerbations (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await well-controlled trials on a wider scale and in more centers.
It is also intriguing to characterize the mechanism of action and to explain the efficacy of TCM treatments or their combinations where possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience mostly a great fear of highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who are quarantined also experience bitterness, sadness, and anger.
Moreover, infection symptoms such as fever, tissue- penetrating oxygen deprivation or hypoxia, and cough as well as the adverse effects of corticosteroid-induced treatments such as insomnia can lead to increased anxiety and mental anxiety.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities have been reported including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide.
Mandatory contact and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, may lead to people becoming more concerned and aware about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and timely assessments of SARS-CoV-2 spread and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to halt the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to susceptible hosts and often aid antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection has not yet been determined before a clinical study begins.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to persistent zoonotic outbreaks from endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and recombinant protein subunits and some animal models have been tested.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge because of the long time (which extends to 18 months) required to produce a vaccine and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has also been associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, developing a prognosis model for disease is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):(Table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs primarily in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of patients over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have latent comorbidities and complications and significantly older than those who are not (at median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infects more males than females (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from chronic heart damage and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver malfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is vital to remember that age and underlying illness are strongly linked and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and complete recovery.
The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
Additionally, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are most released during tissue breakdown.
Thus, they are traditional signs of heart or liver malfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues for predicting outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because a high dose of corticosteroids is widely used in severe SARS patients, many avascular osteonecrosis survivors suffer long-term disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: Mental stress: As described above, with the spread of COVID-19 many patients suffer from extreme stress as they often endure long quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty and witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, SARS appears to have different epidemiological characteristics to COVID-19.
In addition to copying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Thus, infected patients in the early stages or during incubation can develop a lot of viruses during daily activity, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is considered to occur when patients are severely ill, while most early transmission does not occur.
Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the spread of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been devastating to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a weakening of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the expansion will be completed by the end of March and the drilling will last 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian team reported detecting SARS-CoV-2 in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have been showing in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually contained.
Possibly like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become more susceptible to infection and eventually die or become a disease-reducing virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, adding a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A new study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Thus, extreme care must be taken to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, associates, and even observers of the presence of patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that can be used to further reduce the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking to the surfaces of materials, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the ingestion of virions as wide as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five folded surgical masks, health care providers who come into direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear applied isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his swollen eyes.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear clear face shields or antiparasites while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance to keep people away from a patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has been transferred as a novel virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only on 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured the public by saying that the new virus has low transmissibility and limited human-to-human replication and that disease prevention and control is not a problem.
This message has significantly eased public alarm, especially as the entire country prepares for the Spring Festival, and missed a critical opportunity to contain the disease at its lowest level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may take this difficult lesson into account and make critical improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word matters to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more strict in containing a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to seduce the public; and (4) more frequently issue emergency and effective drills to raise public awareness about epidemics and occasionally test and improve the existing social response system.
The spread of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is almost identical to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and SARS also have similar symptoms, the spread of COVID-19 has created a feeling of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some striking differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for epidemic control and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than youth and more men than women, and the severity and rate of death is also higher in older individuals than in youth.
SARS had a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even without symptoms whereas SARS patients usually do so when their illness is severe, which makes it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may re-positively test for the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Due to the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homologs have been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like strains of CoVs, we still cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 originated in strains.
In which animal does the intermediate species transfer the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
The answers to #1 and #2 are unknown, we cannot efficiently cut the transition, and the spread may recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause the resulting pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or return periodically like the flu?
This is important but may take some time to find the answers to the above questions and many others.
Whatever the alternative may be, however, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were identified to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown how aggressive and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put the CoVs back in the spotlight and we were surprised by its rapid transmission but reduced pathogenicity or disease causation compared to its sibling SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs will serve us well.
Most HCoVs originate from mosquitoes where they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has a direct implication in preventing human diseases.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals could also gain important insight into human CoV pathogenesis.
In this review, we present an overview of existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and species translocation.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from a viral evolutionary and genome recombination perspective.
The current CoV 2019 (COVID-19) disease epidemic is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for successful host transmissions and the implications of viral evolution on the severity of the disease were also examined.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses cover the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses are called ""CoVs"" because of their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope".
Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar arrangement.
An estimated two-thirds of the genome contains two large joint open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins were further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific lines of accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoV lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV genera contain the most HCoVs and are divided into four lines (A , B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary storehouse of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continued to cross species boundaries and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Of these HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs included HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually present mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in relatively more patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the cold of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that infection with HCoVs is normally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with an initial death rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years ago, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with worldwide spread.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was then renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice or pets.
Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show good genetic variation.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented a major medical, scientific, social and moral challenge in China and around the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, causes and factors of restriction of migration across species.
It may also guide or expedite the detection of the storage, intermediate and amplifier animal host (s) of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review we show an overview of zoonotic origins, transition between species and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we focused on and discussed the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after transmission between species to a new host.
We also investigated the evolutionary course of HCoVs where the rate of transmission (transmissibility) often coincides with a decrease in pathogenicity or disease causation.
The outcome of the ongoing spread of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal passages of patients who had had the common cold, various CoVs were isolated in various infected animals, including pigs, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and later adapted to grow into WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibited common cold symptoms, including headache, nausea, malaise and swelling of the throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial transfer to the brains of pig babies.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those of HCoV-229E, with symptoms not detectable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and they are likely to be transferred during winter to temperate climates.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few of the immunocompromised patients showed serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
"SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and the etiological agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered".
The first case of SARS may have been detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to the highly transmissible, it is estimated that each case may result in approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially seen with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and tremor, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as end-symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver failure tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities in the SARS laboratory.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and enlargement of macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients eventually require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also become infected in this more severe case, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an elderly patient who had traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, intense efforts have been focused on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first found to be prevalent in children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in HCoV-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is confined to the Netherlands, it has in fact spread throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, and its peak prevalence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the inflammatory bowel disease, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with chronic diarrhea.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illnesses.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause high pathogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe infection in the lower respiratory tract in China.
Often, when these HCoVs have the ability to spread rapidly and persist in humans, their virulence or pathogenicity is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had chronic pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary transmission to close relatives have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive chronic pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop chronic kidney failure, which is now unique for MERS to HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of the patients have bowel symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, batches of pneumonia patients suspected to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the continuing spread of infection in the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and has also called the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with an estimated case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Interestingly, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the figure outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are seen as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Tattoos have also been seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are nearly identical due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are aligned in different branches on the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects or subjects who do not show symptoms infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and matching of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal striking similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the disease course of HCoVs are almost identical.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection displays characteristics more commonly seen during infection in community-acquired HCoVs, including the expression of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows remarkable characteristic patterns of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs that are available in the community.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transmissions as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in waste samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role as in the case of SARS-CoV at all under certain circumstances remains to be seen by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may show periodicity as in cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its ability to migrate, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmissions could influence the ultimate fate of the continued spread of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms are well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two may have originated from ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious disease in humans and the person who has had a serious HCoV have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to be copied to humans at a sufficient scale to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that contradict host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the more people it infects, the greater the chance that it will become fully adapted to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission to humans would be difficult to prevent by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human populations, initiating the common cold in patients with normal disease response.
These viruses do not require a storage animal.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not adapt well to humans and their transmission within humans is not sustainable.
They need to maintain and expand their zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to move to susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and reinforcing hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly contagious like the HCoVs that have been collected in the community, at present.
However, it is more disease-causing or more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and move within humans without a reservoir or intermediate host animal.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will help us to discuss the evolutionary definitions and characteristics, natural reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it will have a closely related ancestor that shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The host virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic to this host.
Also, a reservoir host holds the HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or upon its introduction to humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
The intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and plays the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate itself repeatedly and then transfer it to humans to increase the range of human infection.
An HCoV may undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to an intermediate host and still establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
In retrospect, epidemiological data showed that the index case of SARS had a history of contact with animal playgrounds.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations have indicated that animal traders have a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgGs compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs in live animal markets were first identified with SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no additional SARS is reported after all the mushrooms in the market are killed.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from forest or farmland without exposure to live animals on the market are clearly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may only serve as an intermediate host-enhancer but not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80% of the various animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that many species of small mammals could also serve as mediating hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
These all appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for a natural animal host of SARS-CoV has opened up a close relationship to the bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoes.
These samples were positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other strain CoVs are 88-92% similar in nucleotide sequence homology to SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none other than one named WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
The conjugate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from fecal waste samples has been shown to use fecal, spinal and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum of convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
Currently, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although the similarity between these two viruses is high, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis included MERS-CoV in the same group as the pancreatic CoV-HKU4 and pancreatic CoV-HKU5.
The pancreatic CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to those of the pancreatic beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild boars.
MERS-CoV and the closest relative of the fungus CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the closest reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels originating from the Middle East in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV equivalent of the virus found in humans was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further suggesting that camels serve as a specific reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that general mild symptoms but substantial viral transmission have been observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
Interestingly, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the mucous membrane, which is also the main route for viral excretions from the intestines.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which may be translocated between humans or unknown routes of transmission involving unknown animal species with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the coV RaTG13 of the pancreas isolated from Rhinolophus affinis pancreases.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence of variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too high to assign a parent strain.
This means that the beans may not be the immediate reservoir host (s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless a near-identical CoV of the beans is found in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 must have been among the wild animal species purchased and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, to which many of the early cases of COVID-19 were associated, suggesting a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of at-risk small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also harbor beta ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The new CoV genomes share 85-92% homology sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with nearly 90% identification at the nucleotide sequence level.
They co-exist in two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses on the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In clear contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more distinct, even though the sequence homology in the genomes is higher.
An earlier study in pangolin-infected patients also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which would be similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study validated various methods of assembly and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence that makes up an estimated 86.3% of the total viral genome length.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the animal hosts mediators of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence of isolation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, bats and other mammals remains stable.
While the highest sequence homology in RBDs was found between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest sequence homology across the genome.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is due to evolutionary selectivity-mediated convergent.
A counter-proposal favours a recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is prevalent in beta-CoVs.
The jury is not yet on immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the cows' CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A strain of the beetle CoV called ARCoV.2 (the Appalachian Ridge CoV) identified in the North American tricolored beetle has been reported to show close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another paniki CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camels are also suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for transitional events between HCoV species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed over to species infecting humans from pets in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Pancreatic alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans but not alpacas may have had contact with the beetles in a degraded ecological area.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E related to the pancake alpha-CoV is distinct and non-pathogenic to pancakes, while the alpaca alpha-CoV causes the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility is undeniable that alpacas have acquired HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats can pass HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while the spider-toothed alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly the same as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a good example of transition between species from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolution of MERS-CoV from bats was identified in its initial identification and further confirmed by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that the spores provide a rich source of viral species for inter-species exchange of genetic fragments and inter-species transfer.
Longevity, multiple colonies, close social contact and strong flight capabilities are all desirable conditions for bats to become a perfect 'virus-spreader.'
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels that are transitioning from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its accidental transmission to humans is accidental and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV because its transmission is untenable.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, is different from that of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They may be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First, the larvae may be reservoir hosts of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Man may divide the ecologically suitable area into swamps by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the central booster hosts where a newly introduced virus related to SARS-CoV-2 has been detected.
People get the virus by killing and eating toy meat.
It is possible that many mammals including pets are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of pets and wildlife for antibodies is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species related to both bats and bats.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different host animal species, three main viral factors are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species boundaries.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation numbers of CoVs can be considered ""moderate"" to ""high"" with an average substitution number of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts".
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high ability to mutate and become weakened or even unstable.
Notably, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, CoV mutation rates are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is often high when CoVs do not adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher degree of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has adapted to other hosts near humans.
Apart from SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will rapidly invalidate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity on genome modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the possibility for co-evolution between different species, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become favorable.
It is supported by a repeated unique open reading frame and protein papers encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, CoVs are random and often move templates during RNA replication through a unique ""copy-choice"" mechanism".
In a host that serves as a replacement vessel, strand replacement often occurs during transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly similar whole and subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction associated with infection
Besides the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor influencing translocation between species.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV was looked at as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection while migrating between species.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates from humans and SARS-CoVs of the genus, SARS-CoV is hypothesized to undergo rapid adaptation to different hosts, especially to mutations in RBD of the S protein.
Often, the RBD on the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is strictly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located at the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as coreceptors for virus entry.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, mice, rats and raccoon dogs, which allows for the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been observed that are distinct from human and civet viral isolates in RBD and 4 of these have been found in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may enhance the binding of the spike protein interaction to the human ACE2 receptor.
Put simply, the two amino acid substitutes may be important in viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is similar.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that its S protein binding affinity in human ACE2 may be altered.
In fact, a study on cryo-EM indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher association of this binding than between human ACE2 and SARSCoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptors are necessary for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different S component.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also report for successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of transmission of HCoVs between animal species is also governed by other host dependencies and restriction factors.
The variation of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents may be a barrier to transition between species.
HCoVs need to adapt to host dependence factors and subvert host restriction facilitates successful transmission between species.
In this regard, the molecular determinants at this critical site of virus-host interaction remain to be defined and described.
A non-biased host-dependent screening across all genomes and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to ground zero
The variation of strawberry CoVs provides many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the cows' CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to dramatically alter viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been proposed to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related pancreatic viruses have been isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide-deleting property of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains that were isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host replacement.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination at the origins of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Also, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced incidents of recombination between different strains, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the exposure of viruses to selective pressures, such as the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to a two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related strains of the common frog and camel virus, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the constraints of selecting their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were observed when the CoVs infected the cheeks, suggesting a similar adaptation between the CoVs and the cheeks.
The beetles have been shown to be highly adaptive to CoVs in anatomical and physiological terms.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the pancreas have effectively reduced the causality of disease induced by CoV.
Furthermore, natural killing of cell activity in the pancreas is inhibited by upregulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low levels of expression of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
Furthermore, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from the high metabolic activity of parasites may both inhibit CoV replication and affect proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing selection pressure for the generation of viral strains that are highly pathogenic when introduced to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for adaptation to the host.
Thus, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate rapidly without getting a strong host immune response.
Here lies the mystery of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what underlies the severe case of human infection.
Severe symptoms are primarily caused by hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was prevented from duplicating the CoV.
The same approach to eliminating the resistance response may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in the pancreas.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the pancreas is defective.
By this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme of where SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While a pancreatic beta-CoV has been identified that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a pancreatic CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Because civets and other animals on the market have been found to contain viruses similar to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs that are remarkably similar or homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studying CoVs in bats and other animals has rapidly changed our understanding of the importance of zoonotic sources and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human infection.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from interaction between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets there could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from markets to avoid zoonotic infection, due to the discovery of several beta-CoV pangolin lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals remains unclear in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation as well as the main source of meat products, milk, leather and oil for the local people.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge that cause outbreaks.
There are various zoonotic CoVs circulating in the wild.
In particular, the co-infection with zoonotic potential of the cows is different.
There have been many instances where these zoonotic CoVs have mutated and recombined, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more infectious and/or deadly to humans in the future.
The wildlife-eating culture in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the onset of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remained in their own natural vessels until they had a chance to float.
Although bats have many features that favor the spread of viruses, the chance of humans being exposed to bats and other types of wildlife could be lost if people were taught to avoid them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from ecological areas of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Some pieces of the speculation of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if the parasites of an ancestral virus SARS-CoV-2 infected the pangolins, it is interesting to see what events the parasites and pangolins of the same ecologically suitable habitat may share.
Second, if bedbugs have a more direct role in human infection, human infection from bedbugs should be determined.
Third, if the third mammal is to be a true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with various species including humans, bats and bats.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be done.
Whether it is a bat, a monkey or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus will be identified with natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing investigations in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
"Updating of diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 ""suspected case"" and ""confirmed case"" is required"
On 6th February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and made a good reference for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment approaches are also constantly updating.
"In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of ""suspect case"" and ""confirmed case"" which are according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the Peoples Republic of China".
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid counselling guide and published it online at Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted considerable attention since its publication.
But remember that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing findings of research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment techniques are also constantly being updated.
For example the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), on 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, released a total of seven editions with some contexts significantly modified.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence for our guidance and has also made an important reference for worldwide demand.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updating in line with the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Testing in the seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case it is necessary to combine any one item of epidemiological history features and two items of clinical indications to make a comprehensive assessment, or it is necessary to meet three items of clinical indications if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infectious case (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of a symptom; (4) a history of contact with a set of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with respiratory and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as homes, offices, schools, and classrooms.).
Clinical manifestations: Clinical manifestations are: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, reduced, or decreased lymphocyte counts in the early stage of onset.
Diagnosing the confirmed case should be based on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or a change of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or titer rising ≥4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for respiratory tract nucleic acid or blood samples has been added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection in blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological validity was added in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers looking for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid testing, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increase the availability of different specimens, and are supported to carry a definite positive antibody result to the confirmed standard.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that reminds us to be on the lookout for patients who are unusually symptomatic and asymptomatic.
"Consequently, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify the person without clinical symptoms as ""low risk"""."
The points system also needs to be validated in further clinical work and study.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and invite readers to comment.
"For the evaluation of ""suspect cases"" and ""confirmed cases"", we suggest that they monitor and follow the latest guidelines of their countries of residence".
Our team also updates guidelines in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the most in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported the number of confirmed cases which included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases which remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, noted that among the dead were four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60, and one was 41-50 years of age.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will be suspended for longer than originally planned, until this coming Saturday.
The public transportation closure was first initiated on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The movement of essential goods -- medical, pharmaceutical and food -- is still permitted.
The first reported cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three were cured.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections had surpassed one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the coronavirus disease.
The momentous event came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia recorded its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that it is one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus have been recorded, adding up to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 US deaths on Wednesday due to coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, nations are announcing stricter measures to stop the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russian citizens will continue to be paid even if they do not go to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the result was 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that lasted all day; previously, the curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australian stores lower the toilet paper limit with each transaction
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles relaxed their restrictions on buying toilet paper in two and one pack per transaction at all stores nationwide, one at a time.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
These restrictions are posted as messages at checkouts, and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Shoppers are reported to be saving out of fear of COVID-19 in case people have to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper that can be purchased for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes follow on from the previous four-pack per transaction restrictions introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in a media release on March 8, reported that with the imposed four restrictions packages, ""many stores were still selling within an hour of delivery"", and called the demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it ""unexpected""".
"Sales have risen ""a sharp rise"" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman".
Costco's Canberra store also limited the allowable quantity to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and doubled the delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI stocked for the planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to raise the bar, but the local council's restrictions on the timing of truck deliveries are difficult to enforce.
He anticipates rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following early store closures, some stores would not be able to operate the next Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, says that stores fill their shelves every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a large item, leading to low inventories, and, when all is bought, leaving ample shelf space, adding to the feeling of scarcity.
""Coles and Woolworths have a vision [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if the product like toilet rolls and sanitiser can be [bought] and lots, maybe you can reduce panic"," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News".
The maker of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said that they ran out of stock last Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, with fewer auctions being held because shoppers had time off during the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a Darwin-based print magazine, included an eight-page slice of toilet paper.
Stores were originally reluctant to implement restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman adds that demand for other products is also high, including masks, sanitary products, dry goods, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado was observed Sunday night limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-reel packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 outbreak  the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  a pandemic.
"Although the term ""pandemic"" refers only to the extent to which a disease has spread, not to the seriousness of specific cases, WHO notes the need to push governments to act:"
All countries can change the course of this pandemic.
When countries detect, test, treat, isolate, target and mobilize their people in response, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO.
"""We are deeply concerned both at the alarming levels of spread and severity and at the alarming levels of inaction"."
"According to Dr. According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is ""unprecedented"".
"He said, in statements published by CNN in February, ""except for the flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous spread in the world"".
"Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying ""we have never seen a pandemic released by a coronavirus"."
He continued, And we have never seen a pandemic before that could be controlled by a plane.
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""bottom line, it's going to get worse"."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the acute chronic respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in an estimated 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people were cured.
The case fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while it ranges worldwide from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and wheezing.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically five days, but it can last from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Symptomatic and supportive therapy are the main treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by enforcing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe disruption of social life around the world, the postponement or cancellation of games, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of equipment compounded by panic buying.
Schools and universities are closed on either a national or local basis in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the microbe has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and Southeast Asian people, and others from areas with significant microbial cases.
Reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases are usually in mates at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the virus is presumed to be of zoonotic origin or to have originated from animals and been translocated to humans.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known human with symptoms was later discovered to be ill on 1 December 2019, and that was not seen by the visible connections in the marketplace afterwards.
Of the early number of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case tracked on November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may be the first.On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reported were denied in China but suddenly surged in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, particularly of those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, few cases have been reported in adolescents, with those under 19 accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.
Cases refer to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies that did not test only those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 established that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections went unnoticed, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical review published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The baseline estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 are 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time from the onset of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum survival of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5 almost 80% of deaths were in the 60s, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official list of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died testing positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, as those who died without being tested may not have been counted - e.g. at home, in care homes, etc.
It is learned from partial data from Italy that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official death rate in COVID factor by 4-5x.
"A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the stated death toll] is an underestimation"", a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the U.S. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths each have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time from the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case fatality ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates for the ratio of death number to case number were reduced from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms from after 1 February 2020).[citation needed] Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed as dying from the disease or infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed (diagnosed and undiagnosed) as dying from the disease.
These statistics are timeless and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Numerologists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the infection death rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimate in this set is consistent with the results from the first randomized trial for COVID-19 in Germany, and with the statistical study examining the effect of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO believes that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and longest onset are uncertain and may vary from location to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State Hospital says, "Undetected, infectious outbreaks typically reach a peak and begin to subside after the disease has no available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to predict when that will happen today.
"Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan explained that ""it could be completed by June"" if all countries that follow WHO advice take steps to contain the outbreak of the virus".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 ""is going to be circulating, potentially for a year or two"."
"According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures are required ""until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more) """.
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think, it is unlikely that this coronavirus---because it is so easily transmitted will completely disappear"" and it is ""likely to be a seasonal disease, recurring every year"".
The fate of the return depends on the survival of the herd and the extent of the change.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively uncertain and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (plema), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, dizziness, headaches, tremors, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or skin irritation.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and tingling faces or lips; prompt medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming infection, so the researchers issued advice that those who have had close contact with the confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and screened to prevent infection.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranging from a few to 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread primarily by close contact and by tiny droplets from coughing, sneezing, or speaking; with close contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that uncovered rowing can emit tiny droplets that travel as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by tiny droplets that remain in the air for long periods of time, which may be formed by speech. Small droplets in the breath may also form during exhalation, including speech, even though the virus does not actually have air.
Small droplets may reach the nostrils or nostrils of people nearby or may travel to the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory fluids to float in the air and thus result in airborne transmission.
It can also be spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns that it may be spread through human waste, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The microbiome is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and in the late stages of the disease.
People who tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared suggested possible transmission before significant symptoms developed.
There are few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries while investigating contact tracing.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, one person generally infects two to three others.
In the gutter, the microbe was found to be visible for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature.Pets and other pets have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the germ to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, such as after contact with other surfaces that may be touched by infected humans.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel microbe, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of severe respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in relation to coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which melts into its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronaviruses are genetically related to the genus Betacoronavirus, to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) with two strains from the panicus.
It is 96% identical to the full genome level in other pancreatic coravavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between viruses from bats and from humans.
Whole-genome comparisons have so far found approximately 92% genetic material similarity of pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Infection by the microbe may first be diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging features being consistent with other processes of pneumonia and disease.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test for COVID-19"."
WHO published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is performed by injecting a nasal or nasopharyngeal swab although injecting a saliva or throat swab may also be used.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US a serological test developed by Cellex is approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiography and computed tomography (CT) imaging of people with signs include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society has compiled an international online database of imaging experiences in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited certainty in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and showed that although breathing is not particularly specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting consideration of it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks were created to see the features of microbial imaging with both radiographs and CTs.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining general good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and flushing or dividing the tissue and placing the tissue directly in the trash.
Those who may already have the infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing is also recommended to avoid exposure.Many governments have restricted or warned against unnecessary travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the microbe has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the microbiome spreads within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected.Health care providers caring for a person who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.Contact monitoring is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from government mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing statements calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other phones.
Users will receive a message if they have had close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Fake rumors about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, rinsing the nose and washing the mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or if their hands are visible; before eating; and after blowing their own nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which blows up its protective bubble.
The CDC even recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned with many solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for the stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, general areas, portable electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by infected persons, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with their folded elbows or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and that any tissue be immediately discarded.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since the use of masks may limit the amount and distance of small droplets moving as they speak, sneeze, and growl.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""Wearing a mask may reduce the habit [of] people touching their faces, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene"." Masks are also recommended for use by people caring for someone who may be sick".
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, such as people caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical fabric face masks. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially in close contact (1 meter or 3 feet or more) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends the wearing of a surgical mask when riding on public transportation or staying in a dangerous area.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make three face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam required everyone to wear a face mask when going out in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that everyone entering a grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when outdoors.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, ordered train and bus stops in the city to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks whenever going outdoors, while also recommending the making of homemade masks for those who cannot afford masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Measures include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping centers.
Individuals may implement social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using social distancing, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments have now mandated or recommended social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by the US to government representatives and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, abnormal hypertension, and a weakened immune system face a greater risk of chronic illness and complications and the CDC advised people to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community outreach.
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to remain in contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic".
This includes recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with at home, who is not infected with the virus or who has no symptoms of the virus.
Home self-isolation is recommended for those who have been tested positive for COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued for high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment, and treatment.
Prevention is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to identify and isolate those infected and also to initiate other infection control measures and vaccines to stop the outbreak of the disease in the remaining population.
If the spread of the disease cannot be contained, efforts will shift to the mitigation phase: measures will be taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health and social care system.
A combination of both harm control and mitigation measures may be carried out at the same time.
Suppression requires more drastic measures to combat the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction rate to less than 1. Part of managing an outbreak of an infectious disease is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as curve-setting the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and gives more time for developing vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleanup. Most prevention measures aimed at preventing extreme violence are based on the most extreme measures, such as enforcing quarantine and reducing travel across cities.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the microbe.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued movements warnings for infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial assistance for people who have been infected and have quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and penalized the illegal concealment of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States showed that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (reversing epidemic growth) had major challenges.
Optimal treatment policies could reduce health-care needs by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overloading health systems.
Suppression or containment may be optional but must be maintained until the virus has spread to the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is first), as infection on the other hand will quickly return when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking an over-the-counter cold medicine, taking fluids, and resting may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids may exacerbate the effects.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
"WHO also said that some ""traditional and home remedies"" may provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19".
Capacity building and adapting health-care facilities for the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a key response to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the replacement of resources in multiple settings, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures as much as possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and building intensive care capacity of human trainers and increasing available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories as to where the earliest case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may have returned on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
Most of it is linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one rumor is that the microbe is from one of these animal species; or, in other words, it originated from the animal.
"On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a ""SARS-positive coronavirus"".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were denounced by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and notified WHO.
Sufficient cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health authorities to start investigating in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, aided by the Chinese New Year parade and Wuhan which is a transportation hub and major railway hub.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had developed symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in having the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
There has been at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
The European pandemic has led many countries in the Schengen Area to restrict free movement and impose border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or nearly 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, over 50 million people were in lockdown in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people were in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion people two days later - about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the earliest case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zheng Jixian observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 26, of which his hospital at Wuhan Jianghan CDC notified on December 27.
The initial analysis of the patient's genetic samples on 27 December 2019 indicated that there was a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission released a public notice on December 31.
The WHO informed on the same day.

"The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission".
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping later described as a ""civil war"" to stop the spread of the virus".
"In what has been described as ""the largest quarantine in human history"", a cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23 that halted travel in and out of Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people".

"Public action controls are in place in many cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (over half the population) are facing some form of external restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the microbe from being ""imported"" from other countries".
For example, Beijing has implemented a 14-day mandatory quarantine law for all international travelers entering the city.On 23 March, only one case in mainland China had been infected in that area in the previous five days, this time by a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases that have been moved domestically has effectively contained and controlled the outbreak in China.
On the same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28 onwards, and there are no specific details on when this policy will end.

The national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mostly related to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
On February 22, of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or nearly 13% reported symptoms.

The measures include mandatory voluntary reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile application, drive-thru testing for the virus with results the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test up to 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program is considered a success in containing the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities. South Korean society was initially improved by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for the impeachment of Moon over their allegedly false government call for a coup, or praising his response.
On March 23, South Korea reported its lowest one-day case in four weeks.

The CNN report indicates that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to screen everyone with the virus to date may have contributed to the high death toll.
The United Kingdom's response to the microbiome first emerged as one of the most relaxed in the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government has not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control - the leading public health institution of the United States government announced they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start to testing, which expanded the true scope of the outbreak at those times.
Defective testing kits made available by the federal government in February destroyed the test, a lack of federal government approval for non-governmental testing kits (by academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the stringent criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March (a doctor's order is required afterwards).

On 23 January, in reaction to the decision of the main authority to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that while it was certainly not a recommendation made by WHO, it was also a very important sign of the promise to contain the epidemic in the area where it was worst and called it an unexpected public health history. On 30 January, after confirming human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in cases in other countries, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the first PHEIC to be called since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC is due to ""the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems".
In response to the travel restrictions, Tedros said that there was "no reason for measures that go against the unnecessary global travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and action".
"On February 5, WHO appealed to the international community for a $675 million contribution to fund the strategic preparedness of low-income countries, citing the urgency to support those countries that ""have no systems in place to detect people infected with the microbiome, even if it emerges""".

Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, warns in a statement that This is a fact-finding exercise for every government on the planet. Wake up. Wake up.
This microbe may be on the way and you need to be prepared, urges that the right response measures can help the world avoid its worst.
"Ryan further stated that current data does not guarantee public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means ""we are seriously accepting that every person on the planet is exposed to that microbiome"".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
"The Director-General said that WHO was ""extremely concerned both at the alarming level of spread and severity, and at the alarming levels of inaction"".

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which started in China's Hubei province.
Some of the provincial-level supervisors of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for their handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that the move was made to protect Communist Party of China general secretary Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Several Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, initially denied acknowledging the initial spread of the coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 that originated in the U.S. or Italy.
"The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the ""China virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"" saying that ""censorship has greatly intensified the virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which has also been criticized by some critics as racism and ""misleading to his administration's failure to contain the disease""".
"The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government cable outlining a communication stratagem that appears to originate with the National Security Council, whose quoted strategy is ""It's all about China".
"We were told to try and get this message out by any means, including press conferences and television appearances. ""Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to the germ-targeted countries are part of a propaganda for global influence".
"EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is ""a geo-political component including efforts to influence through rotation and the 'politics of openness'"."
Borrell also said that China is aggressively sending out the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
US sanctions on April 3 blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other countries in their own country.
And there have been reported mask disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators that were on loan from Spain.
Earlier in March, the Italian government pointed to the lack of European Union solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy.
"Maurizio Massari, the Italian ambassador to the EU, said that ""Only China has responded bilaterally".
"Certainly, this is not a good sign of European unity. """
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Russian army to send military medicines, customized disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
"The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unidentified ""high level of political resource"" that 80 percent of Russian aid was ""worthless or of little use to Italy""".
"The source accuses Russia of starting a ""geopolitical and diplomatic"" painful standoff".
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent an air cargo of medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that when offering assistance to US allies, [Putin] assumed that when US manufacturers of medical equipment and materials have enough opportunity, they can also compensate them if necessary.
"The planned NATO ""Defender 2020"" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale".
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it is putting at risk not only the lives of soldiers from the US and many European countries participating in the operation but also those living in the country of their operation. The Iranian government has been severely affected by the microbe, with two dozen members of parliament infected as well as other current or former political prisoners.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying his country was struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the US sanctions against Iran.The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including universal health care, universal care for children, paid family leave, and higher levels of child funding for public health.
Political analysts believe that this will negatively impact the chances of winning the 2020 presidential election.
"South Korea has criticized Japan's ""vague and passive quarantine efforts"" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be placed for two weeks in 'quarantine' at government-designated sites".
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for criticism of Moon over what they say is the government's wrong response to the initial outbreak, or praising his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some of the commentators expressed their concerns that this would allow governments to consolidate their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree with no end in sight, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The spread of the coronavirus disease has been blamed in part on a lack of supply, stemming from increased global use of equipment to combat the outbreak, threatened purchases, and delays in factory and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruption.
Many localities have also witnessed panic buying that has led to the depletion of staple grocery stores such as food, toilet paper, and fresh water, which has been exacerbated by supply shortages.
The technology industry in particular warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This need has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and has also accelerated the delay in the supply of medical items by four to six months.
It has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, so WHO warns that it will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and subsequent ban by the Australian government. Despite the high number of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, both areas were helped out of chronic food shortages.
China and Italy have been successful in their efforts to combat the illegal concealment and trafficking of critical products, avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a significant drop in agricultural production, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were empty for a short time, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws already exist in Italy that require food producers to reserve for emergency situations.
China has felt the damage to the global economy: according to a media report on March 16, China's economy was very hard to reach in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of the microbe, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak is seen as a major disruptive threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit stated that the market will remain volatile until a clearer picture of potential outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic downturn due to the impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from an expert at Washington's St. Louis Plant has given a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly ""scrambled"" after a steep drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China".
Stock markets around the world fell on 24 February due to the volume of the rising number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to perceived concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed their deepest breaks since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The week ended with more than 10% in all three indices.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's highest credit rating, but maintained a Negative Outlook.
Stocks are bouncing again based on the fear of coronavirus, the biggest bounce being on 16 March.
Many viewed the economic downturn as a likely outcome.

Central banks are responding more quickly than when the financial meltdown occurred in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closures of public places including travel attractions, and warnings from governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have canceled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe has collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry line is at a level never seen before.
Some railway stations and ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year celebrations, and by private companies themselves closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple landmarks.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the official New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 3343% drop in shoppers in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Mall operators around the world are imposing additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check customers' temperatures, and cancellation of events.[citation needed] A United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the pandemic-impacted contraction could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been the case without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, nearly 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant workers are stranded at home in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.The lockdown in India has caused the unemployment of ten million migrant workers in India (paid by daily wages).[citation needed] A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada have experienced some type of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million workers in France applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million workers in Britain applied for the global credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to temporary employment schemes under a government aid known as Kurzarbeit.
France and Britain implemented the temporary work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has severely affected the operations of organisations as well as individuals both employed and self-employed around the world.
Arts and cultural sector organizations have attempted to advance their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage in the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and in various scope, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have unceremoniously closed their performances, events and performances that have been cancelled or postponed.
In response there has been a concerted effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapid eradication of the disease has been the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced a setback. The Vatican announced that the Roman Holy Day celebrations, which would take place on the last Sunday of the Christian Lent season, were canceled.
Many dioceses recommend that elderly Christians stay at home rather than attend Mass every Sunday; some of the churches offer mass via radio, online live streaming or television while others offer worship in their parked vehicles.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the absence of Christian believers in St. Peter's Square, other religious organizations have also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and also later closed altars, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign travelers as well as its residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major games were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season.
"The outbreak has hampered plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event ""will be scheduled for a date later than 2020 but no later than summer 2021"".Casinos and other gambling venues around the world are closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled".
This has led to many gamblers moving online, with many online casinos reporting significant increases in their new sign-ups. The music industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
All performances of many large theaters such as those on Broadway were also suspended.
"Some artists are exploring ways to continue to produce and share work on the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based ""fun" for presenting, distributing, and expressing artists' work".
Online, many coronavirus-themed memes have spread as many turn to humor and distraction amidst uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, more serious prejudice, xenophobia, and racial hatred have been observed among Chinese and East Asian people, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hatred have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when China still had the majority of cases) recorded racist sentiments expressed to various groups around the world by Chinese people who deserve the microbe or receive the supposedly just compensation.
Some African countries have also seen rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their region of origin.
Support was provided for the Chinese, both online and offline, and those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the introduction of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first European country to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially raised petitions urging to ban Chinese from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in the number of racist abuse, as well as abuse.
"US president Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"", a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-Chinese".
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which shares a border with China, and studying in India's major cities have reportedly experienced panic related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party unit president Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and ""so God was taking revenge against them"".
"The comments were later ridiculed by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it ""wrong"". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents was fueled by the pandemic, foreigners were described as ""white trash"" and targeted for ""disposal""".
Many newspapers with paywalls have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to radiation available with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly with preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and in people that detect antibodies created in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus' RNA.
The test is specific and is only intended to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the most recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for observation in the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have developed the disease, including people whose symptoms are too simple to report or people who do not show symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and the level of immunity of the human group in the population can be determined from the results of this testing.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the microbiome in their populations.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was widespread confusion about how many tests should be performed nationwide.
Its change could have a major impact on the level of reported deaths, which are likely to be widely overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained from various methods, including nasal or nasopharyngeal swab or a sample of dura or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
A proposed RT-PCR test using saliva swabs or throat swabs is only reliable in the first week of illness.
Over time the virus may disappear in the lungs as it continues to multiply.
For infected people tested in the second week, an alternative sample material may be taken from the deep airway via a suction catheter or may use a fecal equipment (dura).
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a clinical grade, detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) for SaRS-CoV-2 based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
"It searches for the ""E"" gene shared by all beta coronavirus, and for the RdRp gene that is unique to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive an emergency use permit from China's National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from PCR.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource".
One of three genetic tests on older versions of the test kits produced adverse results due to misrepresentations, and a botched test at the CDC in Atlanta; it resulted in a total of fewer than 100 samples per day being successfully processed in all of February 2020.
Tests using the two substances are not specified to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and not until state and local laboratories are allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in the early days of March 2020.
Starting on March 5, 2020 LabCorp announced the worldwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics has been conducting a similar nationwide COVID-19 screening since March 9, 2020.
No volume limitation is announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC guidelines.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Healthcare Oversight.[citation needed] On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed the test to detect COVID-19 infection.[citation needed] On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the test that can be performed in 3.5 hours at high volume, thus allowing the machine to perform an estimated 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.[citation needed]
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; recently the FDA has issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute review.
The FDA approved testing using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of constant temperature cycles this method can deliver positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.The test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus has been developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it will provide results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
"A literature review in March 2020 confirmed that chest radiographs have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while CT [computed tomography] results can show even before symptoms appear."""
Common features of CT include a bilateral multilobar ground-glass that is pale in color and has a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, over-preparation and integration are developed as the disease develops.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the source of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, where many of its imaging features overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used to screen for or as the first set of tests to identify COVID-19"".As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening".
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection of individuals as early as 7 days or so after symptoms appear, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring.
High-result automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these assays but their availability depends on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a sample for whole blood or peripheral blood is usually used, although serial specimens may be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT the target blood sample is usually obtained by intramuscular injection.
Unlike PCR methods the screening step is not required prior to assay.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as requested and are now thus able to distribute their tests to their antibody.
As of April 7, 2020, only test kits have been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.[citation needed] In the last days of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours and is thus faster than the conventional PCR assay of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK learned that there were not enough effective antibody testing kits it had purchased.
"Hong Kong has set up a plan where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a specimen tube"", they will break it open, return it and collect the results after a while. The British NHS reported that it is spearheading the plan to screen suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient spreading the virus to others when they go to the hospital or need to disinfect the ambulance when someone uses it. In drive-through tests for COVID-19 for suspected cases, healthcare professionals will collect samples using appropriate precautions".
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most extensive testing of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2, it had a capacity of nearly 12,000 tests per day on an outpatient basis and 10,700 were tested in the first week.
The cost is charged to the health insurance when the examination is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Starting March 19 in-vehicle testing is offered in major cities.
As of March 26, 2020 the total number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown, as only positive results are reported.
"The first lab survey revealed that starting from the calendar week of 12/2020 an estimated total of 483,295 were tested up to and including the week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2".In Israel, researchers developed and tested a method of testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by collecting samples and only re-testing if the combined sample tested positive.In Wuhan the temporary 2000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory called ""Huo-Yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, or ""Fire Eye"" in English) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process over 10,000 samples per day".
In the construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasting 5 days, the modeling showed cases in Hubei would be 47 times higher and the equivalent amount of quarantine practice would be doubled if this testing capacity did not come on line.
Huo-Yan's labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai are closely following the Wuhan Laboratory, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020 the daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day.Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays have been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assays.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of the ingredient were a barrier to multiple reviews in the EU and the UK and US.
This led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols involving heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further analysis.[citation needed] It was announced on 31 March that the United Arab Emirates is now testing more of its population for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and is in line with increasing the testing rate to reach the large population.
"This was through a combination of drive-through capability, and the purchase of a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
The laboratory has the capacity to perform ten thousand RT-PCR tests per day developed over 14 days and is the world's leading on this scale to operate outside of China.
Various test recipes targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization used the German recipe for manufacturing kits that were sent to low-income countries that lacked the resources to build their own kits.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which limited the tests available in the U.S. China and the United States have had problems with the reliability of test kits in early outbreaks, and these countries and Australia have not been able to supply enough kits to meet the need and recommendations for testing by health experts.
Conversely, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity mostly in private sector laboratories has been built up for almost several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization was called upon to begin testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to the clumping of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and supplies of swabs and chemical ingredients are in short supply.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
"In the United States, the CDC-developed test kits had ""slippers""; so the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate".
The company explains that the false results could be the result of incorrect sampling or misuse of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the kits that returned false results, and replace them with other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested it should be thrown into the Danube.[citation needed] Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a ""high level of waste"" and were not ""used"".The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but this early April 2020 announced that they were not being used".[21]
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and follow-up of those who came into contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the town of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two tests on a population of nearly 3,400 people, ten days apart.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were quarantined.
By traveling through restricted areas, it completely reduces new infections.
With aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on incoming travel, testing, and quarantining, Singapore's 2020 coronavirus pandemic has progressed more slowly than other developing countries, but without severe restrictions such as mandatory closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after the March 23 holiday.
Some other countries have managed the pandemic through vigorous contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with a high number of deaths had a lower rate of death, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries without testing capabilities and the national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmed testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
In the following chart, the range of positive as % of tests is influenced by the national testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other things being equal.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
"Continuous hand washing with soap in certain ""dangerous situations"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route".
People with respiratory illnesses such as the flu or the common cold can also become infected, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (the mucous membranes).
Among the five critical moments on days when washing hands is important are: before and after washing, after cleaning a baby's nappy or changing a diaper, before feeding a baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
When water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child bathed.
After you breathe in, bend or squeeze.
After touching an animal, eating an animal, or eating animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to health care practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, microbes, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people who administer food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important skill for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious cause of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the number of deaths among babies born at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing may lead to a slight improvement in the height of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, the numbers of youth deaths related to respiratory and urinary diseases can be reduced by initiating simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action could reduce the death toll from these diseases by almost 50%.
Advances in hand washing could reduce the incidence of diarrhea by a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in urination episodes can be attributed to handwashing. Handwashing is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent urination and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as an automatic practice practiced in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major KING, is the number one cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Pneumonia and pneumonia are responsible for the deaths of some 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of washing hands before eating and after bathing can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from chronic respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often accompanied by other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against infection transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to an irritating, folding skin condition also known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Excessive hand washing has also been seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
five observed times of day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of fecal-oral disease; after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning the baby's bowel (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other times when proper hand-washing practices should be practiced for preventing the transmission of disease include the new and after treatment of a cut or wound; after cutting, coughing, or blowing your nose; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after handling garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A handwashing study in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households routinely washed their hands with soap.[citation needed] A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest number at 97 percent; the United States was near the middle at 77 percent; and China had the lowest number at 23 percent.[citation needed] Several behavioral change methods are now available to increase awareness of handwashing habits with soap during hot weather.[citation needed] Handwashing groups for school-age youth are an option in developing countries for deep handwashing habits among young people.[citation needed]
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of timely action to promote children's health and education".
Twice a year, the purge, supplemented by daily hand washing with soap, fluoridated tooth brushing, is at the center of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is increased by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins do not easily mix with water, which is part of the organic soil.
However, cleanliness is aided by a reasonable flow of water.
Solid soap may contain bacteria derived from previous uses, due to its recyclability.
A small number of studies looking at microbial transmissions from contaminated whole soap have concluded that transmissions are uncertain because the bacteria have already been exposed to the bubble.
"The CDC still states that ""liquid soap that does not need to be touched to be excreted is preferable""."
Antibacterial soaps have become highly promoted in the health-obsessed public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended antiseptic or disinfectant is preferred for organisms that are not naturally resistant to antibiotics.
Antibacterial soaps, however, contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of unprotected organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are commercially available.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, acids may contain sophisticated formulations (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and additional skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive review from the Oregon School of Public Health suggests that simple soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and bacteria from the hands.
Hot water, which is a comfortable way to wash one's hands, is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria multiply rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot, brackish water is more effective than cold, brackish water in removing the natural oils that harbor soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that the use of sparkling water has no effect on reducing the germs that carry the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer that does not use water.
In the late 1990's and early 21st century, nonwater-based alcohol hand washing agents (also known as alcohol-based hand washes, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that is formed from a mixture of a thickening agent such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) that can make a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin that can make a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding hydrogen-peroxide-based adds more antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol are effective microbicides.
Alcoholic toilet cleaners kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some of the viruses (such as HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost all ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) strains of microbes, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A moderate amount of hand antiseptic or hand sanitizer alcohol must be used to completely cover or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and between and the tips of all fingers are held for about 30 seconds until the liquid, bubble, or gel dries.
The tips of the fingers should also be thoroughly washed, rubbing them with both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing in addition to hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dryness of the skin unless skin softeners and/ or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/ or other sweeteners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softeners caused overall less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives contained in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
The lower tendency to accelerate irritant contact dermatitis has been an attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous agents do not clean organic material on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many disease-causing agents, since the pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of nonalcoholic hand sanitizer is highly dependent on ingredients and formulation, and historically it has been significantly less effective than alcohol and chewing alcohols.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have repeated and cumulative antibacterial activity after fermentation, unlike alcohol, which has shown decreased potency after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil can be more effective than just water, but it can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if microorganisms contaminate soil or ash they may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant agent because upon contact with water, it becomes an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand-washing is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for preventing the transmission of disease that includes the following measures:
Wash hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because the water in the reservoir can be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Rub the soap on the hands by rubbing them with the right amount of soap, along the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap lifts microbes from the skin, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than just water.
Wrap for at least 20 seconds.
Coughing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and long coughing removes more germs.
Take a good look under the running water.
Pumpkin rinsing can re-contaminate the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and dry hands are more likely to become re-infected. The most common areas of contamination are the groin, wrist, the areas between the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and nail polishes with a hard substance can hide microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent hand dryness; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
"Different low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap water and/or soap are not available. water from a tap jerrycan or gourd with suitable holes and/or use of ash if required in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as ""tippy-tap""s and other low-cost options".
Tipping is a simple technique that uses a rope-mounted boot, a foot-operated tongue, to pour a little water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand-drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of hand-drying in public washrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers seen in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel industry European Tissue Symposium, compared the level of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the surface of the fingers by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Jet-air drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the surface of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the fingertips by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether other washing-room users and the washing-room environment had been potentially contaminated as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at a rated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can suck microorganisms from hands and the unit and potentially infect other bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a warm-air hand dryer will disperse microorganisms up to three feet [0.25 m] from the dryer.
Paper towels showed a meaningless spread of microorganisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt, another method of hand drying was recommended.
The following changes in bacterial counts after hand-drying have been observed:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
An alternative while traveling without soap and water is to wash your hands with hand sanitizers.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer needs to contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after a Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found a decline in infection rates with their use.
Medical handwashing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or a gel to rinse and rinse each part of the hands.
Hands should be tightened on all sides.
If there is dirt under the nail, the teeth of the brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can linger in the water on hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to kill the water (and to open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again from his traps.
The reason for hand washing in the health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing deficiencies remain at unacceptable levels in almost all medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses often forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the number of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization publishes a paper showing the standard of hand washing and hand-washing in health-care sectors.
The organization's hand-health guideline plan is also available on its website for public comment.
A related review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and verify the hand health care standard, if necessary demonstrating compliance with the regulation.
"The World Health Organization has a ""Five Minutes"" for hand washing:"
after exposure to blood/body fluids
before an aseptic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicated soaps) causes a lethal action in a hand-washing agent.
Such a killing action may be desired before surgery or in areas where antibiotic-resistant organisms are prevalent. To clean a person's hands for surgical surgery, a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it, chlorhexidine or iodine washing, sterilized brushes for rubbing and a sterilized instrument for cleaning under the fingernails are essential.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and arms to the elbow, usually 26 minutes.
Long cooking time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When bathing, water in the arms must be stopped from flowing back to the hands.
After the hand washing is complete, the hands are dried with a clean cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before or after caring for someone who is sick.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand hygiene came from the first 20% of washing, and the very small additional benefit was gained by 35% frequent hand hygiene.
Washing with regular soap causes more than three times the level of infectious bacterial disease transmitted through food compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap.[citation needed] Comparing hand washing with an alcohol solution to hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds showed each that hand washing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% over antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand scrubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A microbes and Clostridium difficle spores from hands. Improvements in hand health care standards in the health care environment may require education for staff on hand washing, ensuring that alcohol-based hand rubs are available, and reminding staff to do so in writing and verbally.
There is a need for more research into which of these methods are most effective in various healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing is recognized as a cost-effective, valuable tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable supplies of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing.
For example, in most African countryside hand-washing faucets near every private or public toilet are inadequate, even with cheap options for making hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of hand washing may also be the result of habitual behavior rather than a lack of soap and water.
Promoting and advocating hand washing with soap can influence consumer sentiment, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to lasting changes in population behavior.
For it to work effectively, management and evaluation are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based practices are effective in increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.[citation needed] An example for promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's Three Star Approach which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health needs.
Once the minimum standard is reached, schools can move from one to a maximum of three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations may be part of hand-washing campaigns being carried out to reduce child morbidity and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is an example of this awareness raising campaign trying to achieve behavior change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF started adopting a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the DALYs avoided.
One review, however, suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more economical than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health - particularly for vulnerable people such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand health care: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern care".
At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In 1980, sudden outbreaks of food and health care diseases accompanied by infections gave way to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's more active promotion of hand health care as an important means of controlling the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness of the importance of hand washing with soap in many countries to protect oneself from those infectious diseases.
For example, signs with proper hand-washing procedures hang next to hand-washing sinks in public places and on the floors of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression washing one's own hands of something, meaning the expression that it weighs heavily on the will to take responsibility for something or to share in the enjoyment of it.
It comes from the passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands in order to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase with a wider use in some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up the supposed stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after knowing or reflecting on unethical practices, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and there is a tendency to value the washing equipment more.
And then, those people who were allowed to wash their hands after meditation like the one mentioned above were less likely to participate in other cleansing equivalent actions, such as volunteering.
Religions advise hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, with water but no soap in hand washing, is part of the ritual hand washing featured in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netela yasin in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate hand washing after using the toilet.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam command washing of hands before or after every meal.
Workplace risk management for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health procedures for hazard controls in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk management depends on the workplace and the job function, based on the risk assessment of infection sources, community disease severity, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have little contact with the public and other workers, which recommends basic infection control, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory standards, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
People with less-hazardous occupations include those who require frequent or close contact with people who are unaware or suspected of having COVID-19, but may have been infected through suspected community transmission or international travel.
These include workers in contact with the general public such as schools, work environments with high population densities, and some of the high-volume retail areas.
Risk control for this group includes, in addition to basic infection control measures, ventilation with high-capacity air filters, anti-shrinkage masks, and the availability of personal protective equipment available in the event of contact with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care and funeral workers who have been exposed to a known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which adds to the extremely high risk of exposure if workers are performing aerosol-making procedures, or collecting or retrieving specimens from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Among the hazard controls appropriate for these workers are engineering controls such as negative-pressure room ventilation, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job function.
The spread of COVID-19 may have some of the same effects within the workplace.
Workers may be discouraged from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of possible infection.
Business patterns can change, both when it comes to what goods are demanded, and the way these goods are obtained (such as shopping at reasonable times or by delivery or by drive-through service or by vehicle transit to purchase).
Eventually, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be halted.
Plans respond to risk levels associated with different worksites and work duties, including sources of exposure, risk factors originating in the home and community area, and risk factors of individual workers such as age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the controls needed to deal with those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the spread of disease.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The goals of the outbreak response include reducing personnel exposure, protecting people at high risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affected the responses made.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is the framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 risks may not be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are modified by work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help to avoid some of the exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, which are well adapted if possible (e.g., respirators), continuously and appropriately worn, frequently inspected, maintained, and replaced, if necessary, and appropriately removed, cleaned, stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with a low risk of infection have little work-related contact with the public and other workers.
Among the basic infection control measures recommended for all workplaces are frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory practices including covering the mouth when coughing and sneezing, providing a container of tissues and waste, preparing for telecommuting or time-interval shifts if necessary, prohibiting workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining frequent cleaning and disinfection around the workplace.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of chronic respiratory illness stay home until their fever, fever signals, and any other symptoms subside for at least 24 hours without the use of fever suppressants or other symptom-relieving medications, and sick leave policies may change, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and employees know these rules.
According to OSHA, low-risk occupations include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 due to ongoing community transmission throughout the business location, or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers in contact with the general public such as schools, densely populated work environments, and some of the high-volume retail areas. Engineering control for this and higher risk groups include installing high-capacity air pollution, increasing the level of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic coverings in the shower, and attaching a drive-through window for customer service. Administrative control for this and high-risk groups include encouraging workers with illnesses to work at home, responding to virtual communication meetings, maintaining protective shifts, maintaining travel in areas where there is no COVID-19 exposure, using emergency equipment such as face masks, developing training on how to protect workers' hands, providing training on how to combat COVID-19 hazards, providing training on how to work in the workplace, providing training on how to work in the public sector, providing training on how to work in the workplace, providing training on how to work in the workplace, providing training on how to work in the workplace, providing personal protective gloves and other tools, and often using COVID-19-related tools.
Workers in this vulnerable group may occasionally need to use respirators.
If someone becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect staff and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or when handling bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, a recurrent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other waste items should be disposed of in the biohazard bag, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include delaying travel in case of illness, and self-isolation and prompt notification to the ship's medical center if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closures to clean and disinfect if an infected person has come from a school building regardless of the size of the community.
When there is low to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between tables, arriving and leaving at different times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms may be implemented.
If there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closures may be considered.For law enforcement personnel who engage in routine daily activity, the immediate health risk is considered low according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact individuals confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are urged to follow the same rules as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
When close contact or close contact occurs during hospitalization, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear before reuse with spray or spray household cleaners, and follow standard operating procedures for concealing and removing clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care workers and contractors to be in the high or very high risk exposure category.
High-risk occupations include health care delivery, support, laboratory, and medical workers who deliver exposed to unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This becomes a very high risk of exposure when workers perform procedures involving aerosol, or collecting or handling specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-making techniques include intubation, coughing techniques, bronchoscopy, some dental operations and tests, or the collection of infectious specimens.
High risk exposures in funeral work include workers involved in the care of human remains with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; they become high risk when they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these high-risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, including the performance of aerosol procedures.
Specialized negative-pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and funeral arrangements.
Specimens should be managed by a Level 3 Biosafety guard.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that incoming patients be quarantined in designated quarantine areas depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet who are known to have, or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV2, and people performing aerosol spraying procedures.
In the United States, N95 artificial face masks with NIOSH-approved respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including coverage testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide higher protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted through the digestive tract rather than through bodily fluids.
Only surgical masks are recommended by WHO for people who have been exposed to the entrance.
For those collecting respiratory samples from, caring for, or transferring COVID-19 patients without aerosol-constitution procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, goggles, or face masks, toga, and gloves.
When an aerosol-forming procedure is performed, an N95 or FFP2 respirator replaces the surgical mask.
As the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for the specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE, and restricting the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

PAKSA: [Covid-19] Easing the load and preparing for the future
SENDATE DATE/TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC This is the date of the first day of the month.
Licensed by CC0 No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a remarkable situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that is taking away our global human connectedness and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
We did not anticipate its challenges, but we knew that our best response would depend on the kind of global compassion, cooperation, and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The heroism and care we see in all our colleagues through email, phone, and chat are remarkable testimony to the wonderful people who were privileged to be with us.
I could not be more grateful and proud to consider all of you as fellow workers.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia today, and what a powerful symbol it is to keep this precious resource online and available to everyone.
It makes your work possible, whether it is keeping places alive or paying our coworkers or making our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This is the moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will create a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to how we work together, starting next week.
Adapting to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our procedure and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we considered what we thought was an appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We were eager to relieve stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call again, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work schedule will be 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday - so that you can work more normal hours, you can use the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for groceries, or see a doctor, we prioritize your welfare.
We don't track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick days or PTO are necessary - just tell your supervisor and help your team adjust calendar and schedules to make sure key work areas are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan within T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C can help with support and make sure your situation gets appropriate attention from management).
People who worked every hour were paid in full.
We have said, and again promise to honor our promises to our contractors and fellow workers who are paid hourly.
Each was paid on his or her normal hourly wage during normal conditions.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
People use work as a way to relieve their stress from the world around us.
Our activities were very satisfying, especially at times like these.
Again, it is about taking care of yourself.
We would ask that you speak with your supervisor, so that we can know what to expect and adjust accordingly.
Some of the work is considered important.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may need additional support.
We begin the process with all departments to assess the current objectives and shift our focus to helping what is important to our mission.
There is much for all of us to do, but we should all focus on the most important project.
Slowing down now will not hurt in the long run.
We are not planning to double the time to catch up with the time when the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are not now realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What happened to the APP?
To adapt to our new reality and daily expectations during working hours, we wanted to adapt the timeline for delivering our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We aim to propose an extension to our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize essential work, self-care, and caring for loved ones while taking care of those who need or want to work to reduce the schedule over the next few weeks.
This lengthening of the timeline greatly reduces the current planning workload and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and update the delegates and team on the next steps by the time we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership on this.
Office status, exposure, and cleaning
A week ago, we learned that one of our colleagues from SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many warnings, we hired a worker to clean up against infection to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use an anti-spastic solution that is appropriate for the hospital level to disinfect every surface, as well as the hallway and elevator floors that reach our floor.
Developing its own duty-of-care protocol uses products that support the safety of their tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be ready when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has already shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff.
Starting last week, our DC office was changed to a fully remote setup in line with the guidance shared in San Francisco.
Since some of our NYC-based colleagues already knew, we also discussed renting a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues were working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues know that this can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer you some of the advice:
Limit the length of meetings to one or two hours at the most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to break them up over the course of several days.
Clearly describe the meeting, have an agenda, and send out the material ahead of time.
Make video commonplace, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to perform live collaboration and connections.
Lead in conducting each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and to keep track of the speaker list, and someone to help to take notes (or do the auxiliary recording).
Email tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work being shared
HR Operations is referring to webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support increased work sharing across the Foundation.
In a previous error we asked all community donors to cancel publicly funded Wikimedia events, such as editathons, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We let them know that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their agreed-upon permitted activities and that no one will be held responsible for any delay or change to those purposes.
Next week we will follow-up for further guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment across the global community seems to be sadness at the devastation but comfort at the clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In continuation, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and track our communication with them.
Keeping in touch around COVID-19 related issues
We will send you an invitation on your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for the special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are here together and here to help whatever we can.
For the time being, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important information related to COVID-19, at the Wiki Office.
The CRT will keep these pages up to date and will put all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with personnel living in the countries currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, or large workflows, coverage challenges, or anything else you may need help with, do not hesitate to notify and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and communication if needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
Rather, they recognize that at this moment, our work and obligations are likely to have to adapt in a way that we did not in the past.
Here are the steps we believe are necessary to support them with each other so that we can continue to work, provide our action with the help they need, and in a world with the service they expect.
There our planned work awaited us when the time came.
Now, it's time to work together and create space for the important work that will come in the weeks ahead and potentially months ahead.
We need all of you to do that, and so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you are at your best when the need arises.
So now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and in addition to the Leader Rank (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
bAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of Ang (((1-7) which makes it a reliable target drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain that is exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is extracted from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of the major lung type II alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main role of ACE2 is to act as an anti-balancing agent to ACE.
ACE separates the angiotensin I hormone from the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn breaks down the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and associated Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the presence of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 protein in the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the microbiome and the enzyme to endosomes located within cells.
This entry process also requires preparation of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of which is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels, in cells, may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls"".
"Moreover, ""it also reduced the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results are less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."""
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is proposed as a novel drug for lung damage, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the (long) course of action of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a reliable drug for those with intolerances to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where the flow of angiotensin II is high.
"COVID-19 b'apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracking in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, e.g. the process of identifying people (""contacts"") who may have come into contact with an infected individual".
Many applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for developing contact-based apps.
Privacy concerns have risen, especially regarding systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be integrating the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to know if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It's used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, it's used in an app called TraceTogether.
"The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open reference and will be provided to the government. North Macedonia launched ""StopKorona!"", a Bluetooth-based application to track the exposure of potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities. ."
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and available for expansion in a few weeks. A similar app was launched in Ireland, and in France (""StopCovid"")".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the app is available only to a small fraction of the population.
"In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple is setting limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to ""official"" or otherwise unregistered organizations".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed concerns regarding the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether the surveillance information created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions to government projects:
"observation must be ""lawful, substantial and proportionate"";"
the monitoring and monitoring extensions must have a specific end date;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity shall be protected and demonstrated to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid excessive discrimination and bias;
any sharing of data with third parties must be defined by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses;
"Meaningful participation by all ""relevant stakeholders"" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalised groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued checklists".
Google/Apple's proposed plan plans to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device's operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based learning is permitted.
Network-based solutions with access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; some privacy-preservation systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources including tracking data from mobile devices and data from transaction cards, and combines them to generate contacts via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, location information has also been made available to the public, something that has been made possible by major changes in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through several apps and websites. Countries including Germany are considering using both centralized and maintaining-privacy systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-aware contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a large body of research literature dating back to 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-aware solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort containing both centralized and decentralized procedures, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Tracking that Maintains Privacy Distance (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, FKA Event Contact Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
With these protocols, the device never removes any data that identifies the person, and all matches take place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy techniques when collecting and using tracking data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive data and location with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have joined forces for nearly identical procedures and cross-platform protocols in the marketplace, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of surveillance and alerting apps, a key aspect in achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened up the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will maintain privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography in maintaining-privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be rolled out in three stages:
Rollout tools to enable governments to create official praybet-maintaining coronavirus tracing apps
Google and Apple plan to address the detection and tracking problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and removing them later in the same way once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the use of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than its original cause of development.
This is a line of scientific research currently underway to develop a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma translation.[citation needed] SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated 66 therapeutic proteins, each containing multiple ligand-binding components.
Analysis of the sites of presence provides a rational project in the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the pepper-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA, et al studied several candidate templates which were then optimized and tested for formulae similar to the highest similar approved drugs to accelerate a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development in his preclinical study recommended in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine are among the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials in New York State of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA's clinical trials process and is only authorized under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but not receiving treatment in a clinical trial.
"The CDC states that ""the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not been established".
"Doctors said they used the drug when ""there was no other option"."
A small study on the use of chloroquine in the combination of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D is being conducted by a Turkish research group in Istanbul.
Large-scale studies are being conducted at the Duke's Laboratory and Oxford Laboratory.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a safety and efficacy trial of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"It is claimed that Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have found favipiravir to be ""clearly effective"".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative for a median of 4 days, while the duration of the illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its own storage, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe made recommendations to the Trump administration regarding the purchase of the drug. The drug may not be as effective in severe cases of disease where the microbiome has multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ""no benefit was observed""".
Drugs are designed to prevent HIV from multiplying by the presence of protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.There is criticism within the scientific community about redirecting resources to drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the global Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections.
One issue in antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate disease and another for those with more severe disease.
There are three current clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Teijins Alvesco (ciclesonide), a highly sought-after corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of as-yet asymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is currently underway with 200 patients recruited from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients experiencing mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 and over who had tested positive for COVID-19 and were experiencing mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breast- feeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception do not qualify.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the guidelines of the 7th edition of the Chinese
Umifenovir: recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics identified as potential to be re-marketed as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
So are trials in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, the causative microbe, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to massive investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
It was stated in April that the requirements for the CEPI initiative for vaccine development were speed, production capacity, widespread delivery, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main targets on the platform that will advance the Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumably in planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial that performs preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and in many places, while determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 are yet to be evaluated in humans (in ""preclinical"" research yet)".
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the Queensland Health Authority announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would modify the genetic proteins of the microbiome to dictate the response of the mosquito.
On about 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the Saskatchewan State Hospital announced the start of work on a vaccine, aiming to start human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and the Hong Kong Embassy on January 28.
On 29 January 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun production of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing collaboration with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with similar technology to one used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25 the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and had begun trials.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
"They want to make a vaccine candidate that can be tested in humans ""in 90 days"."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on developing a vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had partnered with Novavax Inc.
to develop and manufacture a vaccine.
The partners further announced plans for a preclinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they were working in 11 isolates, and even with a hurry it would take about one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a viral coronavirus particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
"Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that CureVac offered ""'large sums of money' for exclusive access to a Covid-19 vaccine"" to US President Donald Trump, to which the German government protested".
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a collaboration with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
candidate vaccine based on mRNA BNT162, currently in pre-clinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that they will have pre-clinical trial results in April 2020 and their final vaccine candidate may begin human trials by late fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a research consortium for a COVID-19 vaccine involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the developed COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
A vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as initiatives by Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" of some new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that the ""MNA-delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines enhanced potent specific-to-antigen antibody responses [in mice] that apparently began 2 weeks after vaccination".""
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is engineered to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities tapped resources to bring in supercomputers from IBM, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called uncertain effects.
This means that they may have benefits that go beyond the illness they are fighting.
The additional randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health-care workers.
It is possible that the vaccines being developed will not be safe or effective.
Early research to test vaccine efficacy using animal models specific to COVID 19, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for biosafety-level 3 control measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure existing standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, no drug or protective vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that has completed phase I in clinical trials in humans, and three others are underway, two viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus behind COVID-19 is known and that a vaccine is available.
The patents mentioned by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, swelling of the intestines, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually within five days but it can last from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
The virus is spread primarily between people who have close contact, often by small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
While these tiny droplets are formed when breathed out, they usually fall to the ground or to surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by contact with contaminated feces and then by contact with their eyes, nose, or throat.
The microbe can survive in the gut for up to 72 hours.
It is highly contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for people who suspect they have the germ and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks in the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others mandating their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drug for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the germ may be asymptomatic or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, recurrent chest pains or cramps, confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial or lip irritation; immediate medical attention is advised if such symptoms occur.
Rarely, symptoms of upper respiratory distress such as wheezing, a cold or swelling of the throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were observed at varying rates.
A few cases in China initially presented only with chest pains and tremors.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will persist for 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be a factor in the spread of disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is still being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain symptom-free during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both dust and dust can carry many viruses.
Loud speech produces more tiny droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered rowing can emit tiny droplets that travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne in general, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the hallway outside people's rooms have obtained samples that are positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to become aerosol and thus result in airborne dispersion.
While there are concerns that it could spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low. The microbe is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while transmission may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, the virus has been detected for up to one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, varies according to the latitude and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective when used properly; soap products dilute the fatty membrane of the microbial layer, kill it, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), were less effective.[citation needed] In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken between two days after the start of hospitalization.
Of five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to cases of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 microbe are inherited from related coronaviruses that are found in nature.
Outside the human body, the microbe is killed by the host plant, where the bubble that protects it bursts. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the microbe accesses the primary cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar lung cells.
The microbe uses a special external glycoprotein called spike (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Severe heart damage was detected in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and it is more common in severe illness.
The number of cardiovascular symptoms is high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders as the disease progresses, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly present in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with poor prognosis or recognition of the disease.[citation needed] Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 were seen with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing respiratory tract epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In fact, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of malignant IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported at autopsy.
The WHO has published some of the diagnostic protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed with breath samples taken from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sample of plaque may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have a small light value.
Chinese scientists have isolated the coronavirus strain and published the genetic result so that laboratories around the world can freely develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect viral infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and even a person has been infected in the past) are in progress, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience in testing has shown that the absolute accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use by the end of the month.Guidelines for the good identification of the characteristics of a disease transmitted by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for managing infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and fusion may appear as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main known causes of autopsy disease are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, adhesion of the lungs and drainage of the lungs
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
treatment of pneumonia: repair of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding contact with contaminated areas, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the throat and nose be covered with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and that the elbow compartment be used when no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after any coughing or wheezing.
The CDC recommends the use of three face masks in public, partly to limit the transmission of asymptomatic individuals.The goal of social distancing strategies is to reduce the exposure of infected people to large groups in conjunction with the closure of schools and workplaces, travel restrictions and cancellation of large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include that people sign at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of COVID-19 management is the attempt to reduce the epidemic's spread, known as ""flattening the curve""".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after bathing or when hands are exposed to dirt, before eating and after breathing, coughing or sneezing.
It even recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""a non-active substance for hand antiseptic"""."
Glycerol is added as a preservative or humectant.
People are treated with intensive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used in response to the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are currently still being considered.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended for boosting immunity.
Supportive treatments may help people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmologists in the U.S. have published a free resource of treatment recommendations from various agencies, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no definitive treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for the first set of uses.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, especially in the health care setting when performing procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airway precautions.
The recommended gear is: The recommended clothing is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use but the FDA allows the use of those masks under Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but effectiveness against a particular biological agent is not guaranteed for unbranded uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks, or as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 respiratory failure is currently being actively studied for people in hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by administering high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether either of these two destinations will have the same benefits for people who have a terminal illness is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to remain with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of small aerosol particles compared to high nasal cannula flow.
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, either setting the capacity of a health system to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases that are too severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation is further complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that COVID-19 develops and makes it difficult to deliver oxygen.
Ventilators with pressure control modes and high PEEP capability are needed to greatly increase oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of damage to the ventilator's lung and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir has turned out to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may be reached as early as 2021 for development, some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medication can be tried on people with serious illnesses.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has given provisional authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to address the sudden outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect close contact using tracking data and therefore a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other people who are using it.
When a potential danger is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health officials. Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and the people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government moved security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to implement quarantine and protect those who may have come into contact with infected civilians.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to track and suppress the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to catch quarantine violators.
"Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that ""40% of people are still circling anyway""".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Also the president of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals experience anxiety from quarantines, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
"The BBC quotes Rory OConnor as saying, ""The increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn are the perfect storm to damage people's mental health and well-being"."
The illness may have a mild course with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while your severe or critical illnesses may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of serious infection with COVID-19 based on data from other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.
In the most affected people, COVID-19 can quickly spread to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidney and liver.
Abnormal blood formation, particularly prothrombin time increase was described in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of previous cases, the median time from the appearance of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Postmortem histopathological examinations of lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in the two lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations were observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lung is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by elevated troponin levels or heart attacks.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations have pre-existing conditions.
Estimates of the number of deaths from the condition vary because of regional differences, but also because of the difficulties of the method.
A low count of moderate cases may lead to an overestimation of the death toll.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of cases obtained in the past may mean that the current death toll is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have chronic COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require cardiovascular care or die than nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority noted a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some of the people recovering from the disease and the lung scan suggested organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity to the disease in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen to be likely, based on the action of other coronaviruses, but in cases where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for the coronavirus at the latest reported date.
Such cases are believed to be exacerbations of a long-standing infection rather than re-infections.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, through the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported the earliest outbreak of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
A number of measures are commonly used to count the death toll.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of the health-care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population types such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case fatality ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of observed individuals who died from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected individuals (tested and untested) who died from a disease.
These statistics are not chronological and follow the specific population from infection by resolution.
While not all people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people are infected.
At the epicenter of the sudden outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) had died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival rides, and spread to the younger population, resulting in relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths can be formally identified as such.
Moreover, the German health system is not compromised.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as expected from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of a pandemic and its death rate differ between men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown higher rates of male mortality.
The highest risk for men is at their age of 50, with the gap between men and women closing at only 90.
In China, the death rate is 2.8 percent for males and 1.7 percent for females.
The exact causes of this sex difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may play a role.
Sex-based immunological differences, low prevalence of smoking among women and men who develop the same serious conditions as hypertension at a younger age than women may have been a factor in higher mortality among men.
In Europe, men accounted for 57% of infected individuals and men accounted for 72% of COVID-19 deaths.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track data on gender-related COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that infectious diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be COVID-19.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for when the sudden outbreak of the disease was first identified: 31 December 2019. 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referencing a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international naming recommendations aimed at preventing name-splitting.
"WHO has additionally used ""the COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus causing COVID-19"" in public communications".
Both the disease and the microbe are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV chronic respiratory diseases as provisional names for the virus and disease in line with the 2015 guidance against the use of disease locations and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health-care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in desperate need of a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver the required time, a local started a reverse engineer and pressed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
Humans have emerged as capable of transmitting the virus to certain animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral envelopment in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY Trial to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral pills with expected efficacy.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Earlier SARS-CoV-products are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers intend to develop a full-fledged vaccine against the virus.
The use of such a microbe, whether it is inactive or dead, is intended to achieve an early immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, vaccine subunits, aims to make a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific microbe subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to activate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique in the creation of vaccination).
Vaccines tested from any of its strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine was initiated with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials currently underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hyroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The newly developed antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries expected to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical progress for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates has been assigned, as of April 2020. Several available antiviral medications are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir mixed with interferon beta.
This is provisional evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine previously used in the treatment of malaria was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there have been calls for peer review.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology advises, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, it notes that a dose twice that is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the capacity of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to contain SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for additional in vivo studies after showing low SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory concentrations. Studies showed that the early preparation of the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) spike protein was significant for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin have limitations that prevent the medical community from including these therapies without further studies.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with serious illness.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms, it is intended to counter such outcomes, which are thought to have caused the deaths of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on previous case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome mediated by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no conclusive, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies developed by the immune systems of people who have survived COVID-19 to people who need it is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy may interfere with the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other types of resistance-free antibody therapy, for example, the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Blood production from the recovered person, consisting of a liquid part of blood from recovered patients and containing antibodies specific to this virus, can be stained for faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after speculating about the spread of the virus.
