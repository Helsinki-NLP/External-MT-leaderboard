In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this gives us details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were shaped like a brownish-brown on the upper side and pale or cartenoid on the lower side.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feather of a dinosaur does not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but has other features of feathers  spines and spiked edges  researchers concluded that the rachis probably originated in a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation and pointers. The researcher's position is that, although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feathers of an adult, not a juvenile.
The researchers noted that although this tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers rather than bird feathers.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two policemen and injured more than twenty others.

The work done is mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be produced by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
By the same principle that the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides and currents, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Arrow galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is arranged around a halo, and it is made up of many tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been very simple in terms of technology: voters are alone in the booth and put a printed ballot with the elected candidate in an envelope.
When officials confirm the voter's identity, he inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be visible so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process.

Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and we have returned her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chanda Shekhar Solanki said they appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Adenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeoye has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised given that her image has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts consider the publication of the photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University observed: Journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish images of suspects or anything else
The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, whose general responsibility is criminal prosecution, told reporters that there would be no further comment until at least the indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will address the border dispute, which the Palestinians want to be based on the pre-Six-Day War borders of 1967.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the treaty, while the Palestinian Authority agrees that the presence exists for only five years.
The shooters in the pest control supplement action were to be under the strict supervision of the rangers, with the action being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and a corporation called the Sport Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers are employed under the Sport Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick Offlin, acting director of park and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first sting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
The new nine-member Electoral Commission (CEP) was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
It is Martelly's fifth election commission in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the CEP's previous resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally, violent protests have been caused by the non-observance of elections, some of which have been in place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, leading to a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry said it was aware of 27 accidents involving such devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "insignificant".
The ministry responded by calling Epples' delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (9:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six of the cattle, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to build a career in the field of medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the hormone would accelerate fetal maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two "black boxes" containing flight records.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night for two months. Pretty unique look like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldstein Runnels commented: "Luna was just as strange as I am...maybe more so...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she is in a better place".
From 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic rose 8 percent from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
In the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 free in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his appeals have raised doubts about his fitness.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it was banned at the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water that reached Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, since comets have collided with the earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is public talk that Wu will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the aircraft's position more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation placed on overhead trains will be stopping at Wembley, and parking lots and "park and ride" type facilities are not available above ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without team fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved over just two generations, although the process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's hare, Geospiza fortes, and the resident cactus hare, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.
It can be worked into a thin wire, which can be spun or braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It may be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal, and may be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illustrated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using the juice of the red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice varies according to how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The ions of hydrogen are the protons from which the electrons are stripped (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of wrapper.
The towns of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet bowls in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of a sewerage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women were in the same company together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then returns it down almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere reflects some of the light and images.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has made it possible for us to travel much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-living pet cats) that eat far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job that each cat does that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, and they live in large groups known as swarms.
The flock consists of one to three adult males in a litter, followed by up to thirty females and juveniles.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lions' paws behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can bark.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but more like a sentence of sharp, high-pitched words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if possible, and all the animals they catch are far smaller than they are.
Scientists think that the ocelots track and search for prey by smell, by smelling the place on the ground they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they move very quietly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in an environment different from that in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger rival than was previously required.
The original population has not changed a bit, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after several thousand or even a million years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mossaurus was the supreme predator of its day, and they feared nothing but other Mossaurus.
His long jaws were pierced with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set of teeth on a hard nape, meaning that nothing that got in his way could escape.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a shellfish tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-rex would not have been able to match it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things of their own for a feast, including wild boars, peacocks, lizards, and a type of rodent called the puff.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on stools, the rich preferred to host banquets at which they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted muereth.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
People would make sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to please the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
At one time, special pyramid-shaped towers, called zygouarates, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the daily life of a Hebrew family was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open shelves facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated; Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the backdrop of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the back of the document has a message, it is not a treasure map.
The backs of the Declaration of Independence were the words The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere in its early days this large parchment document (dimensioning 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was used for storage.
Well, most likely the label was added purely as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was run by the "Visigiev" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and allied themselves with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of a community.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across several generations, lasting cultural imprints and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and are often not recognized as true civilizations.
While the war for independence was being waged, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all their legal documents.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Unanimous approval by all the states was required before members could change, and the states were so easily swayed by the central government that their representatives were often absent from the meetings.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called  archipelago on geographical displays.
The island's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilia Formosa, or Wonderful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of aboriginal wheat-making practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which gave Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still-image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio inherited the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of dimensions of this format is thought to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio in the form of a whole number).
Many common formats (say the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly equal to this size.
The often abused and often derided rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the images.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be subject to censorship.
For thousands of years, Christianity united the nations of Europe, despite differences in language and customs.
With its inexhaustible power, it affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire stretches of ocean, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and the nation were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job with the New York Edison Company, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each period of China or each family in power represented a distinct dynasty.
There were also unstable provincial periods between each dynasty, the most famous of all being the Three Kingdoms period which lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was fierce warfare between many of the nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the throne in the huge palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also after the revolution, the professions were opened to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, for instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were outside of his ordinary life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain Nur (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find, even if one knows of its existence.
Nothing is to be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is to be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramidal structures that honor the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The uz arc looks like a V, and the niz arc like a splice or a square missing the lower side.
Upper means you should start from the top and squeeze the gag, while below means you should start from the crank (where your hand holds the gag) and pull the gag.
Raising the honks usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the honks produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to pencil in your marks, but remember that the printed humming signs are there for a musical reason, and they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, 11, and Louis-Charles, four), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to retreat to Paris from Versailles, and were forced to do so by a woman from the Piazza.
They were traveling back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and chanting threats against the king and queen.
The ruler ordered the king and queen to open wide the windows of the carriage.
At one point, he waved the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the costs and interest on the securities that were circulated in the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The high medieval period was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself proceeds by a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, a motor vehicle might be said to lead to the development of roads.
Still, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures would arise tied to that geography, and these, in accordance with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until around 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bringing gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the disputed communication channels, the styles in the West could be lagging behind by some 25 to 30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the greatest inventions of the time as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Consumption farming is farming that is conducted to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Consumption farming is a simple, often organic system, that uses preserved seeds, native to a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-employed, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be particular because of age, ethnicity, class affiliation, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often denote their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to some sad cases of children who, because of neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children is due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical defects.
Abused children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children display behavior (within physical limits) that almost completely resembles the behavior of those animals who have cared for them, such as their fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the skala system goes a step further.
Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides support to individuals, with help in going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of a support but also a little human-coupler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual tutors are an integral part of the software and should examine, encourage and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to perform on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing, and nurturing, but it does.
We consider the foster system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-family system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
Family-based child care should provide any necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and access to content.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important purposes of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eimey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "maintained relationships" as new motivational aspects in their study of audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that if you correctly interpret microexpressions, you can tell if someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The Presidential Speech, pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even thinks that animals such as domestic dogs may have such abilities in understanding human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unseen.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection is the removal of the expressed variation from the stock.
Segregation and recombination affect the constant mixing of variations between the two funds in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a human-like digestive tract has difficulty meeting the need for amino acids from the plant sources at its disposal.
Even if this is not done, serious consequences may result: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The plant resources that were most easily accessed were the proteins available in the leaves and the vegetables, but the receptacles like us find it difficult to digest them if they are not cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (mosquitoes, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
REM sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be explained by a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you reset the clock while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own negativity and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of a kundalini yoga, meditation, and an all-encompassing path of love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga. Visualizing the various deities cleanses energy channels, activates the chakras and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to the two countries becoming entangled.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be a straightforward one, through conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian Bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Trans-oceanic shipping is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to smuggle men and arms across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines primarily, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and fur.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goats that were mostly children or young, similar to the more familiar herdsmen.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the more uneven roads of the time.
Railroad tracks were introduced fairly early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wheel.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first full-iron tires were used.
The first known form of transport was on foot. People began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is common.
The improvement in bipedalism was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sachelanthropus may have walked on two legs as far back as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases this is symptomatic, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and put it out.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made greater by mankind's overcrowded and extravagant way of life.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to the press of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 specimens, now known as "Danla's pages", were made overnight.
Johnson first read the document publicly on July 8 in the Independence Hall courtyard.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, with a copy arriving in London on August 10.
The 25 copies of the Dunlap manuscript that are still known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have spiked feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
It may not be immediately obvious that the poisoning is internal, but symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open package of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with the cockroach, an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common cockroaches are long-term parental species, adapted to life in the bed or home of a host.
Across the United States, there are an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study showed that women are twice as likely to have MS symptoms than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can be the child's parent.
The primary task of science is to understand the way the world works by using the scientific method, which actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not just responses to periodic shifts in external influences have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to rotate freely even if there are no external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in the basal cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal life of the wild.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Each morning, people leave small rural areas by car to go to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplaces are right where they left them.
In this dynamic transportation process, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this high-carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and make daily mistakes? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic currents is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of the facilities along the way.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This gives them a greater choice of various small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are the fairy horses and the water flower.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, since it does not feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its mestimic width of six miles.
A full twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, by then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man from ancient times, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of just one or a few of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that they convert into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy metals are actually mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are, of course, metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of small amounts of nonmetals, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, when new methods of writing appeared, the pen was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having been near a cutter.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new is found.
The fission bomb works by taking energy to make a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
This is similar to pushing a heavy wheelbarrow up a hill, and the energy released by the splitting of the core is then added to the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The moon's surface is composed of rock and dust, and the outer layer is called the lunar crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is shallower under the lunar sea and thicker under the hills.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories are geared towards finding out what moves people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslov's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain single from the boys (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything that the team has done and make it his own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Such behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local management would not have an understanding of.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports.
One of the goals for applying the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge that is shared and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, and by doing so, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and materials to make simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI draws strong connotations towards science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military purposes, having been incorporated into several home computers and video game software applications.
Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their class.
Virtual sharing of experiences from trips is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, each year the web page is re-designed, but old versions are kept online so that they can serve as an album.
Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience largely changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to work on correcting the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to become more resourceful about the world around them".[32] The need to stimulate the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online materials, students can define their own views in the context of other texts, as well as express their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this further highlights Ontario as something that foreigners consider to be primarily Canadian.
Large areas farther north are fairly sparsely inhabited, and some are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely accepted on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, from when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: All travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to follow them, hold their hand, and so forth.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it is not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and even the Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Dar el-Badia, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name of Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagis, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of dranguli, but all of this is intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by the lava of the Nyiragongo River, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is fairly safe, any visits outside Goma should be well researched to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base from which the climb to the Nyiragongo volcano begins, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (a motorcycle-style taxi) to get around Goma.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
Threatened by desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stations during the filming of "The Wonder of the African World", on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the state, as it has more Arab than African influences.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which contains a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main attraction of South African National Parks (SANPs).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and park entry.
Consider also the purchase of a wildcard, which allows entry into certain South African parks or all of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is compared to a brilliant banded graph that is made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon Bay on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban area is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place was taken over by British colonialists, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal belt of mangroves in the world, and stretches 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the backwaters of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the interior of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only swamps of mangroves but also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Pegasus deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-city bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumerang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punak (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-George-d'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 271 feet [83 m], and the bridge is 1,298 feet [378 m] long and has two 3.5-foot [3.5 m] wide lanes.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 metres in size.[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of the customs posts on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in self-sustaining agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guajkur√∫ and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly called the Diwi Province of India, Paraguay was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and swords can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For all tournament news and information on where to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association (Asociacion Argentina de Polo).
The official Falkland currency is the Falklands Pound (FRF) whose value is set equivalent to the value of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across the road from FIC West.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British currency and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the island, so change the money before leaving the island.
Because Montevid√©u is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures over 30¬∞C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel much cooler than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild world is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, keep at least 100 yards [100 yards] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 yards] from all other wild animals!
Despite their appearance, bison, North American and European elk, bears, and almost all large animals can be attacked.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep proper distances.
Additionally, know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and the title of the capital of Samoa has been officially held since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with nearly two hundred American and German lives lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasseses Lealofi III.
With Auckland stretching across two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being those in three areas:
The North Shore (in the area of North Port) beaches are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe bathing areas, and most of them are also covered with a chill that makes trees crackle.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in WaitematƒÅ Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, and with a rich array of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer Broj jedan is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines that are good to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for travel.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
To Australians, coffee is a foreign concept: white double espresso with milk; short black is espresso; cappuccino comes high in a high-dose drink (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the juice is expensive but exceptional.
Numerous trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of the above causes are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Quarter-headed jellyfish appear near the beach and near the river mouth from October to April north of the town in 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away from you.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, though you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through them.
Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, a guaranteed airport shuttle, or even a combination of flight and hotel arrangements.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or they can get you other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Keep in mind that while the music may have stopped on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during the winter, check the hut's location, since the passage through the ice causes rather terrible sounds for those most affected.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg cover the time spent in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that visitors spend.
They usually have special offerings of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in the building.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served at the house's expense, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive over wide areas or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the signage is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to cause you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or flying snow, as well as fog or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is probably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the pinnacle of experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to a land journey where you can see fascinating African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move slowly toward cars, so standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you may want to take a closer look.
Walking safaris (also called "nature walks", "walking safaris", or "walking tours") consist of walking, lasting a couple of hours or a couple of days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in an uncomfortable situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price of most tickets for events will range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, with the price of typical tickets being around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer the possibility of renting a sawblade and a saw board, even if you do not have them in your room.
If a cast iron is not available, or if you do not like to wear cast-iron socks, then you may try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too warm (which can lead to flaking or, in extreme cases, freezing).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which work better than certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying water from reputable companies in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not familiar with their native regions.
They can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
The very infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can brutalize or kill a person usually do not become pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at designated locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a decent amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent races  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone network is much stronger here than along many other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those from its southern neighbor, Austria.
The fruit cake is frequent, with apples being baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called berliner, funk√ºhen, or kraffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a herb-based dish and spices in combination with meat or vegetables.
Cari can be suv or mocar, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But, when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually denotes food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a diverse array of simply seasoned dishes, among which are the predominant flavorings that Javanese prefer such as peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The reins are the supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can pose a safety problem due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets stuck in the harness, he may be pulled out if the horse continues to run.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow heel.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety barriers that allow the skin of the spindle to fall off the saddle if pulled by the rider at the moment of falling.
The Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, breathtaking views are provided. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes through the uncharted potentials of the mountain.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a range of snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as skiers, plan entire vacations spent skiing at a particular location.
The idea of carving is extremely old - cave paintings depicting carvers date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is often called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, ski-touring or alpine-style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more distance than by walking  but very rarely will you reach the speed of a Nordic skier without a heavy sled on the groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to pass through visa and passport control more than once.
In this respect, however, the Schengen Area functions much like a single state.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without re-passing passport checkpoints.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member states separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes a manufactured item antique, and some tax agencies define products over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America relative to Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
Irving is important to the life of the Lapons, and culture within commerce is also important to many who are engaged in other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami were largely devoted to raising irwas, but lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, and the irwas were mainly used for towing and carrying cargo.
Today, many Lapons work in modern crafts, and tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, a region in the Lapland region.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word gygypsy is often considered offensive because it arouses negative stereotypes and wrong conclusions about Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel recommendations, it may affect your health insurance or travel insurance.
You may also want to listen to the advice of the governments of other countries, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios from Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are just brief summaries of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any phenomenon of dangerous weather that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or result in loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include lightning, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather in the area where they are, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wants to travel to a country that could be called a war zone would have to undergo professional training beforehand.
If you search the Internet and type "hostile environment course", you will likely get the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, mostly with practical experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, full first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo sex-change surgery abroad must be checked to make sure that they have valid documents for return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify a person's gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with this document is equally diverse.
Checks at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to be let through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Cross currents represent the backflow of waves that are moving away from the beach, often present on a reef or similar places.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper parts and can create fast currents down to the deep water.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue while attempting to swim upstream, which can be unmanageable.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it is otherwise.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you are observed, you may wish to wait for rescue.
Retreat shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the shorter period of the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust back to their native culture.
When you returned home from living abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your customs from your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding toward you, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adjust.
People may not expect that travelers returning home will also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children here.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
The sound and light story is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains merge into the highlands, and then reappear to form a 360-mile chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel chain lies the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Vinson reaching 4892 m (19,030 ft).
In remote places where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a cell phone, for to make a call, you must be outdoors and have your satellite in plain sight.
This service is often used for ship travel, including yachting, as well as for expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with those finishing school, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during the year when you are taking a break may improve your prospects of progressing to higher education in your home country.
There is usually a fee to enroll in some of these educational programs.
Finland is a great sailing destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
You do not need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
While the archipelagos and the largest lakes of the Baltic Sea are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is from one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return and sleep on the ship for the night.
If you go to the coast only as part of boat excursions, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of; it is no different from personal fears and reservations about other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown or on the inability to have control over events.
Curious companies are well paid for fast delivery of things, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, slaves, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for some other routes or smaller firms, it was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through customs and customs.
The only way to speed things up was to check in baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to check in baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, to get the company you work for to do it for you).
This, however, is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times as much as a standard economy business card, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point even in asking for discounts on business and first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
This conflict in 1994 resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic ties were re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market square, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Hallodarsk offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has a unique octagonal church.
In the portico of the church, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some tombs.
It is worth taking a half-hour walk through the intriguing village.
To the north and in close proximity is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron noted its splendid story of wonders.
The 403 Scout Bus travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place known worldwide by the Virgin Mary's directions.
Please note that you are visiting a place of mass graves, as well as a place of almost unquantifiable significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived to live here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or robbed to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by making markings or cutting graffiti on objects.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and in fact all know Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, since it is established by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also used extensively in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular metro announcements are in Catalan only, but unplanned interruptions are announced automatically in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unkind, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is bien √©lev√© (well-behaved).
The rude behavior of the Parisian quickly evaporates if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an extremely wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, differing soils, and varying levels of elevation.
This area is also home to an extraordinary number of different species of animals and birds.
Rare species of animals, including brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and great apes, as well as many more endangered species, can be found here
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees and shoulders covered.
Most monasteries have provided dresses for women who have come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially with bright colors, you will elicit a smile on the monk or nun's face at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
And you can borrow these from the store at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and generally uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is œÄŒ± Œ±ŒºœÄ œåŒªŒπ: bread with olive oil, tomato and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie, which stands for the word You, are always written with a capital initial, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It can also be said to facilitate reading, although writing is a bit complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or a preposition is used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The basic letters to be noted are c and d, as their pronunciation varies depending on the consonant.
Also try to pronounce r and r differently: k means dear, while k means coachman.
Persian has a relatively simple and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you to learn much about the grammar of the Persian language and to understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you speak some Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is sufficiently similar that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, existing as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they were more readily available than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first celebration of the cherry blossom was organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
The plants look best when they are in a natural setting, so resist the challenge of removing at least one sample.
If you are visiting a formal garden, you will also be expelled by collecting a sample, and this without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit and is very easy to get around, and you can buy everything on arrival.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to wear it both in the heat (always) and in the bright sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
A pair of buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take is going to Hebron itself, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
River roads in the interior can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, a tour of the Loire Valley castles, the Rhine valleys, or a cruise to the sights of the Danube or a boat ride along the Irrigation Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by both non-Christians in Christendom and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of spending the night of the resurrection without sleeping, in an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this ritual of spring and fertility predates the arrival of Christians.
More traditional churches often hold a resurrection vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, while communities often go on a midnight vigil to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from traveling, making the giant tortoise the primary animal grazing on the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be dimmer and darker throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is hierarchical and more formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
The uniforms are business-like, and the workers address one another by their surname or by their job title.
Workplace harmony is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than individual accomplishments.
Often, employees must seek the approval of their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to respect their superiors' instructions without compromise.
