Welsh AMs 'worried about looking stupid'
Some AMs are concerned about the suggestion to change their titles to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The problem arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum have expressed concern that the decision could be ridiculed.
One Labour AM said that "it's mixed up with Twp and Pwp" and that this has caused concern in their group.
For readers outside Wales: twp in Welsh means stupid and pwp means shit.
One Plaid AM said the group was "unhappy" and suggested alternative names.
A Welsh Conservative said that their group had an "open mind" about changing the name, but that it was just another form of Muppets or fools from MWP.
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the pronunciation of u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which was preparing legislation to change the current names, stated: "The final decision on the descriptions of the names of the members of the congregation is left to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that there was a large backing for the Legislative Assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission was in favour of the name of Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the name MWP had the most public support.
The AMs suggested alternatives, but reaching a consensus decision could prove a headache for the incumbent, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft copy of the legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms covers rules disqualifying AMs and other changes in the functioning of the legislature including the design of the committee system.
AMs have the final say on the question of what to call them when discussing legislation.
Macedonians hold a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has also insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory, and has objected to its efforts to gain EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gyorge Ivanov, who opposes the vote for the name change, said he did not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zhiv, argue that the name change is the price for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Hours is quiet while Harlem churches are struggling.
Mr. Adams said, "The elders I spoke to say that historically there was a bar and a church on every corner.
"Today, there is neither".
He said that the bars can understand the meaning of Maya.
He said that nowadays people connect with each other in different ways.
Today, bars are no longer the comfortable neighborhood that people regularly go to.
As for the churches, they think that the money they have sold the property will not last as long as they think, and that tomorrow they will return to the place where they started their journey.
He further said, apartment buildings with condominiums could be built by removing churches and people who have no inclination to help their neighbours could live in these buildings.
He said that most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white. He said that he hopes the day will come when these churches will close together, because people who come to live in these condominiums are not likely to become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white religious groups before Harlem became a capital of blacks - that is, before Harlem became a metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martins a community decades later.
The original white Methodist religious group left in the 1930s.
A religious group of blacks worshiping nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martins was taken over by a black religious group led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a fight against black retailers on Harlem's main street, 125th Street, who refused to hire or promote them.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's parish followers had plans to rebuild the building, Carrillan was given the task.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bell".
In July, the experts who played the carillon called it by a different name: "cultural asset" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, said that it was also the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who had moved to the Riverside Church 18 years earlier to play an even larger carillon.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The situation at St. Martin in the last few months has been one of architectural and contractor complexity, with some being brought in by lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Westerly, the governing body of the parish of Lay Leader, expressed its concern in a letter to the diocese in July, stating that while Westerly had no responsibility for hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese, the diocese was directing Westerly to pay its costs.
Some parishioners complained that the role of the diocese was not transparent.
A shark that injured a 13-year-old boy while lobster diving in California
A 13-year-old boy who jumped into the water to catch a lobster on the opening day of the lobster season in California was attacked and injured by a shark, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7am near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel, who spoke to KSWB-TV in San Diego, said he heard a boy screaming for help while diving with a friend for about half an hour on Saturday morning and went on a boat with a group to pull the boy out of the water.
'At first, Hamel thought it was the excited screams of a boy catching a lobster. But when he listened more carefully, he realized that the boy was screaming in pain, 'I was bitten!'
I was bitten!'
When Hamal saw the boy, he said, "His whole neck is broken".
"Everyone out of the water", Hamal continued, "and I shouted: 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was airlifted by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in critical condition.
It was not known what species of fish the shark was that caused the attack.
Life Guard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago but had been confirmed as not being an endangered species.
Further elaborating on the matter, Giles said the victim had traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
For questioning and safety purposes, the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamise in Escinitas was barred for 48 hours by the authorities.
Giles said there are 135 shark species in the area, most of which are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury's plans to tap into the UK cosmetics market
It will have a strong competition to Boots, Super Drug and Debnums with its department store-style, well-trained beauty oils.
With falling fashion and homeware sales, the brand is entering the growing UK £2.8 billion cosmetics market and will test its big beauty oils in 11 stores across the country, with plans to open more stores next year if the trial is successful.
Investments in cosmetics are being made in a context where supermarkets are competing to use space that used to be reserved for TVs, microwaves and homeware for cosmetics.
For the first time, the company plans to offer 3,000 beauty products, including brands like Revlon, SC, Tweezers Man and Dr. Papa.
The L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees products currently in use are also branded on a par with products available in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique make-up range with a view to selling more vegan-friendly products.
In addition, Fragrans Shop, a perfume retailer, will offer discounts at one of two Sens Bureaux stores in Croydon, south London, which opened last week, and a second store to open later this year in Sellicoke, Birmingham.
In these days of increasing online shopping and the habit of buying small food items from convenience stores every day, it takes a lot of effort to convince people to visit supermarkets.
Mike Koop, chief executive of Sainsbury's, says that their outlets often look like department stores and that supermarket chains are competing with Aldi and Lidl, which have fallen out of the competition by offering more services and non-food items at a discount.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and many of the Habitat's have also introduced both grades two years ago, which has increased grocery sales and thus the stores are making more profit from the purchase.
Supermarket's previous attempts to revitalize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical divisions had failed.
Sainsbury's began a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to share revenues from pharmacies in its supermarkets.
Sainsbury's set out to develop a new strategy after it sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyd's pharmacy store owner Celesio for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a key role in the project by adding more luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pousée and Veche to its four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty isles to give more of a brighter store environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our consultants who are always available.
Our range of brands is designed to meet the needs of everyone and due to the glamorous atmosphere and convenient locations, we have emerged as a marketplace for beauty products that break the old shopping habits and captivate the mind.
Peter Jones 'squatted' as Holly Willoughby exits £11 business
Jones was seconded by TV presenter Holly Willoughby to Mark & Spencer and to deal with her new contracts with ITV after she withdrew from the £11 million lifestyle brand deal with Peter Jones of Dragons' Den fame.
Willby doesn't have time for Truly, his brand of homeware and accessories.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning show host took to Instagram to announce that she was walking out of the deal.
Jones is angry that she withdrew at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand deal with Peter Jones of Dragons Den fame in order to focus on her new bumper contracts with Holly Willoughby Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly furious after a crucial meeting at the Jones business office in Marlow, Birminghamshire, on Tuesday, when he said that his new £1.5 million business deal would mean that TV's golden girl would not be able to give time to Jones's homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The deal was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was estimated to have raised Wilby's fortune by £11 million.
After announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, the 37-year-old Jones left Britain for her holiday home in the far-flung country.
According to one source: "Hallie always gave Truli the first prize.
It would have supported her future for a long time and would have sustained her popularity for a few more decades.
Her decision to withdraw from the contract came as a surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, as the launch was the next day.
The warehouse at Marlow HQ is full of goods ready for sale".
Experts believe the departure of one of Britain's most popular stars, the presenter of The Morning, will cost the company millions of pounds and further delay its launch, as the company has invested heavily in everything from cushions and candles to clothing and homeware.
And this can end a long-standing friendship.
Wilby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have known Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly in 2016 with Cap, and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The couples spend their vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will be replacing ITV's I'm a Celebrity M host Ant McPartlin.
Last night a man close to Jones said "we don't like to comment on his business activities".
"I was born in a small town in the northern part of the country", says a woman who lives in the city of Osh.
He joked that the news media would criticize him for making a comment that some considered "unsuitable for the presidency" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up on all of this?
Trump said he was "ironically" in his "newscaster's" voice.
"I have left nothing behind".
He said that he was interested in meeting Kim for the second time after his first visit to Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a big step towards making North Korea a nuclear-free nation.
But the talks on denuclearisation have stalled.
Three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yang Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the US had not "responded appropriately" when North Korea decided to take arms embargo measures earlier.
Instead, he said, the US aims to increase pressure by imposing sanctions.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are very good", he said.
"We had the idea of going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now our relations are in the best condition.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results, including the completion of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers.
And when talking about his relationship with Kim, he supported his unusual behavior.
Trump, waving directly at the crowd in front of him, said, "It's very easy to be president, but instead of helping the 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded place, we want to let about 200 people stand there".
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, causing hundreds of deaths.
For example, they were told that there was no need for foreign NGOs after the earthquake in Lombok.
Although Lombok evacuated more than 10 percent of its population, it did not declare a national disaster, which was essential to get international help.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not need international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenge", Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is uncertain whether the overseas staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopowo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said: Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Although Indonesia is regularly struck by earthquakes, it is clear that the country is not prepared to deal with natural disasters.
Tsunami dwellings have been built in Aseh, but they are very rare in coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was known to be coming, the loss of life was not avoided due to the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu.
In normal times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters further complicate transportation.
The hospital ship in Lombok has been travelling towards the port to treat earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure a focus of his election campaign, and accordingly spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Joko is running short of money for re-election next year.
Joco also faces sectarian violence in Indonesia, where many members of the Muslim community follow a narrow view of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands more were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets using axes, bows and arrows, and other local weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a spectacular goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge avoided defeat by Liverpool by scoring a goal in the 89th minute in the Football Premier League at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
In the 1-0 goal, Sturridge's team received a pass from Jer Don Shakir when they were about 30 yards out of the Chelsea goal.
He tapped it to his left before scooping the ball to a distant post.
His kick caused the ball to bounce higher than the box and landed in the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over the head of Kepa Arizabella, who was jumping to stop it, and landed in the net.
"I was trying to get in a proper position and try to control the ball and players like Shaq always play the ball as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the ball coming toward me, but I touched it only once and then I swallowed it".
Chelsea scored in the 25th minute, with a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard, to take the match 1-0 at half-time.
The Blues striker carried the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving near the midfield and running towards the liver pool.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go in midfield.
He then threw the ball very beautifully and made it fall into the hazard box.
Hazard also went to the post-net and made a left-footed pass to Liverpool's Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Pool Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Vidéotron in the UEFA Europa League, which will be played in London on Thursday at 3pm.
The death toll from the Indonesia tsunami rises to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday created waves 20 feet high and left many people trapped under rubber piles of collapsed buildings, agency spokesman Suto Puro Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with rubber debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been opened after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am near Grayson Muse in John Street with stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested as the last suspect.
Police have requested that if anyone in the area of the murder heard or saw anything, they should report it to the police.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would ask that anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in John Street, Birkenhead, contact us.
And most importantly, we ask the taxi drivers if they have captured something in the dash cam footage of their vehicles which could provide crucial information in our investigation.
The woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found in a property enclosure, a police spokesman said.
Friends of the deceased woman have arrived at the scene this afternoon and are asking questions about where the body was found in the morning.
The inquiries are continuing and the police have made efforts to inform the close relatives of the deceased, the police said.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to enter his flat but was not allowed to enter or leave the building, police said.
He knew what had happened there, but he didn't say anything.
The residents are being told that they will be allowed to enter the building only after a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a person that the whole place is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman arrived at the scene in tears.
'It's a terrible thing,' she says from above.
By 2 pm, two police vans were inside the cordon or police fence, while the other van was outside.
Several police officers inside the cordon were supervising the blocks of flats.
Any person with information is requested to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously by entering the date of 30th September log 247 at 0800 555 111.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament has recently become a controversial monument 'making new history'
To ban it would be to do justice to the many cultural and religious artifacts in England that Cromwell's fanatical Puritans destroyed in Taliban-style.
But Crick's suggestion was described by the Cromwell Society as "foolish" and "an attempt to distort history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be subject to controversy in the current debate on the removal of statues.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the sculpture-busting operation during the English Civil Wars.
Cromwell's ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier, may have been the innocent victim of his actions.
Sir William Hammo Thornycroft, who represented Cromwell, is a mirror to the 19th century popular opinion and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe can be venerated today.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Compared with today, Cromwell was much respected in the latter part of the 19th century for his efforts to protect Parliament from the external pressures of the monarchy.
But whether it is accurately represented in its entirety is a matter of continuous historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is the only known figure to represent one side of that divide.
The Lord Protector should be celebrated and his achievements should be mourned".
A Chinese farmer was killed by a carnivorous pig.
According to local media reports, a pig has attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found in a pig market in Lupan Shui, Guizhou province, covered in blood and his arteries were severed.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to vaccinate all pigs in his pig farm.
According to one report, he came to this market on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother's relative found his body and noticed that the door to the adjacent pigsty was open.
He told me that the big fat pig in the pigsty had a bloody mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig bit and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were soaked in blood and disfigured", said Jiang, a cousin of the deceased who was fond of the nickname "Wu".
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
An hour later, his body was found.
The beast that killed Yuan is not his, nor his brother's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was restrained to prevent it from attacking anyone while police were sifting through evidence at the scene.
The report said that his family members and market officials have been in talks to compensate for Yvan's death.
Although such incidents are rare, there have been previous reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their backyard, causing severe injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig farmer weighing 650 pounds was trying to injure a farmer near his tractor in Wales when his wife scared him off.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally prone to attack, but that the taste of blood can "trigger" them.
"They're just playing.
They are like little children, very curious... they don't intend to harm you.
You just have to show them proper respect".
Heavy rainfall will be widespread in the southwestern US as a result of the arrival of Hurricane Rosa.
Hurricane Rosa is approaching the northern coast of Mexico, according to the weather forecast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall across northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the coming days.
By 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane, blowing at 85 mph, and was felt as far away as 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is taking on a ring shape and heading east toward the west coast of the U.S. It will approach the island of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, penetrating the southwestern U.S. and pushing tropical humidity northward.
Rosa Monday will see 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical humidity reacting with approaching cyclone will bring extensive downpours in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall in the desert creates dangerous flooding, waste is spilled and landslides occur.
Extreme tropical humidity can cause 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to be 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, primarily in most parts of Arizona.
The uncontrolled release of tropical rainfall can cause flooding due to subsidence conditions.
The tropical rainfall makes it very dangerous to wander in the desert on foot.
Heavy rains turn deep ravines into overflowing rivers and locally loud winds and dust are seen due to the stormy rains.
The approaching cyclonic storm will bring locally heavy rainfall to the Southern California coastal region.
A little more than half an inch of rain can cause a little litter to leak and roads to slip.
This will be the first rain of the season.
Some tropical rain showers will move into Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, then spread throughout the state on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Heavy rainfall in all four directions is expected to continue till Wednesday.
The Arctic cooling in October will cause temperature fluctuations throughout the US, but warm weather will continue in the tropics.
Sometimes this causes a lot of temperature variations in short intervals.
There were several temperature variations across the central US on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming few days, the summer heat will continue and spread widely.
The central and eastern parts of the US are expected to start October with warm temperatures and 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City will reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is 10 degrees above average temperature.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that the eastern US is likely to experience above average temperatures in the early days of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blassey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in 1980, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political tension continued by preventing broadcasters from airing the trial, which was due to end on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had reached a deal with the FBI to hold a week-long trial on the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was 100 percent true that Kevano had caught her in a drunken stupor during a high school party and tried to take her clothes off.
Kewano said in his strong testimony that it was 100 percent true that it did not happen.
It is likely to have been seen by more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewing rate of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The statistics were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network, which aired the testimony.
And Nielsen has a little bit of trouble keeping track of people who are usually in the office.
In one sense, the audience for the trial was the same as that for a football game or an Academy Award.
Nielsen said that several people on the Fox News Channel expressed support for the appointment of Kewano, who led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the court hearing.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the hearing, the interest of the people doubled.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's fight.
After a statement from the Republican General Office that he would vote for Kevano, he was targeted by CNN and CBS cameras as he entered an elevator to attend a judicial committee hearing on Friday morning, and opponents shouted slogans against him.
He was humiliated on live television on CNN and remained unseen for several minutes.
"I am standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the nation?
"When women are so weak, you are strong", he was told.
Flack said that a statement was issued from his office and that he had a lot to say at the committee hearing before the elevator doors closed.
Cable and broadcast networks then carried the live broadcast, during which the Judiciary Committee voted to send Kvanno to the full Senate for a vote on the nomination.
But Flake said he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee next week, as requested by the minority Democratic Party.
Flake was partly convinced by the words of his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was strong, as it was clear that Republicans could not vote to approve Kevanno until the trial was over.
President Trump has assigned the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kevanno.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of 'playing politics' on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with regard to Britain's future and national interest, in the wake of her plans to leave the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29th September 2018.
In his interview published alongside May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said May's statement that Checker's Brexit plan was "completely irrelevant" and that Britain and the EU should collect their tariffs.
Police arrested suspect Dayton Simpson in connection with the shooting of Wade Sims.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the case of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was the victim of a fatal shooting at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder.
Officials released video of the collision between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims lost his glasses during the collision.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police found glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on them.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
According to the lawyer's report, his will was worth $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office, which released an initial report Friday, said the death was due to a bullet passing through the head and entering the neck.
The department congratulated the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and citizens of the area for their cooperation in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alewa thanked law enforcement in the area for their "dedication and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "in shock" by Wade's death.
"That's what you're always worrying about", Wade said.
The volcano is still active, but the city is still a major tourist attraction.
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the pits and 183 gas emissions and ash were seen over a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring many sounds and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating on car windshields in the neighboring city of Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of a polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
The rioters were stopped by the police, a pro-separatist group of masked protesters threw eggs and powdered paint at them, creating a dust cloud in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes started again when police used their batons to control the disturbance.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Never forget, never forgive" while unionist protesters chanted "Long live Spain".
According to local newspaper reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protest.
Tensions have risen in the pro-independence region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrated.
Although the number of people who voted was much lower than those who opposed secession, voters in large numbers chose to be independent.
According to Catalan officials, about 1000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-freedom groups had been stationed Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The show was held, but it had to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer confident about the chances of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we witnessed one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they were able to vote, but now we are trapped", he said.
Despite a hard-won victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year as many of their prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in holding the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Jon Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone, and said that he believed the clash was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the repression in democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government", he said.
London Derry: People arrested after car breaks into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in a London derry.
The incident took place at Ballinagaard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Death inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At one point, a grenade may have been thrown at the car.
Menga gave a 1-0 win to the Strike Livingston against the Rangers
Dali Menga's first goal for Livingston scored the winning goal
Steven Gerrard, who had been promoted to Livingston, surprised Rangers by conceding only the second defeat in his 18 appearances as manager of the Ibrox club.
Daly Menga's strike made the difference as Gary Holt's team equalised Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side are winless in the premiership this season and face leaders Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended their undefeated run in the division to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Mailer last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against tough visitors
Holt's team had to be ahead before they scored, as his direct passing was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but struggled in his effort when the goal was scored, then Alan Lithgow was only able to broadly direct his effort as he slid across the goal to block Craig Holcett's header.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew they could disturb the visitors at other times.
And the decisive goal came in the same way.
Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston scored an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to face Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the box.
By that time, the Rangers were dominating the parade but the home defense was unassailable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled,
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos scored a save from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was denied the opportunity by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and flipped wide by another Livingston set play from Lithgow.
Crosses came in the Livingston box continually and were continually cleared, but two penalty claims - one after Holckett's challenge on substituting Glenn Middleton and one after the handball - were moved away.
The Bible says that "they are the ones that will be saved".
Allasdare Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A great performance and result from Livingston.
For one man, he was the best, and he continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and crew have not changed since he returned to the top flight, but Holt has to be congratulated for the way he has equipped the team since he arrived.
There are many heroes.
Captain Holcett was formidable, he led a well-organized defense, but kept Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Voral always busy.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Even though he sometimes played as well as under Gerard, he was below that standard.
They were missing the final ball - having only broken through the home side once - and this was a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin, there were laughter and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at mending relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the inauguration of a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Although the police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, enough supporters had gathered there to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - expressed their protest, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These dual protests reflect the division of the audience, which is hailed by some German Turks as heroes and denounced by others as autocrats.
Deptford Road Accident: Cyclist killed after being hit by car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended to him but the man died at the scene.
The accident comes after another cyclist was killed in a hit and run on Childress Street a month ago, a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus turns have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officers were injured in the incident at the high security men's prison, the prison office said.
The chaos broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called in to control a riot involving eight inmates and taking place in one section.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Special trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and spend even more time in jail".
HMP Long Lartain has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The governor of the prison was reportedly treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate in June.
And last October, riot officials were called to the jail after staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (poor areas may benefit)
While it is rare for tropical depressions to hit Arizona, this increases the risks of flash flooding as Hurricane Rosa is likely to drain its remaining power in the Desert Southwest next week.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for southern and eastern Nevada from western Arizona, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, to southeastern California and Utah on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is predicted to come directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "Since 1950, only ten tropical storms have maintained tropical storm or air mass collapse status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundary".
The latest National Hurricane Center models estimated rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with isolated amounts of 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches, with individual totals likely to be up to 4 inches.
For those who are out of the flash flood danger, the pink rain may prove to be a blessing, since the area is a dry area.
While flooding is a very serious concern, this rainfall could be of some benefit as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Draft Monitor, 40 percent of Arizona's population is experiencing at least severe drought, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still in hurricane strength with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and therefore its strength is diminishing.
Thus, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening in tropical storm strength.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which can pose a significant flooding risk.
"We expect 3 to 6 inches of rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and it could be as much as 10 inches", weather.com reports.
Rosa then will move north across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical storm, and it will pass through Arizona and southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main risk that could be expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause deadly flash flooding and debris flooding in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found in an injured condition at around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Mid Somer Norton.
He was taken to hospital, where he is said to be in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the area of Roudstock, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh felt the "wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and ruthless tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had experienced the "wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his swearing-in.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations that Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his allegation.
That day, the president said Saturday, the Americans witnessed Cavanagh's "wonder and quality and courage".
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal scholars of our time, a jurist with an outstanding record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections.
"One of the most important elections of our lifetime is five weeks away.
I'm not struggling, but I'm really struggling", he said.
"That's why I'm running around fighting for the best candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats aimed to "defend and deter".
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote of the Senate session on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place later Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number is expected to rise.
At least 384 people were killed and many more were washed ashore when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the city's beach on Friday afternoon, when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the beach in the early afternoon, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake was followed by a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still active on the beach and they did not immediately run away and they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPP, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled at 800 kilometers per hour (497 mph) in the open ocean before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
A statement issued by the Indonesian Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugraho said the deaths and damage could be concentrated in the area of Donggala, 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu on the coast, close to the epicenter.
From Donggala, "communications are completely disabled without any information", said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse", it said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami to Palu, but officials said the waves hit just as the warning was given.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of the building can be heard shouting warnings to people on the street below about an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which cut communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun to send aid cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but food and other basic necessities are needed very urgently for the displaced.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami disaster is more than 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached Palu city where employees have taken shelter in tarpaulin shelters set up in their office premises and have seen the devastation as they came in.
"He told me he saw a lot of houses destroyed", she said.
This is very bad.
Although relief groups have begun serious disaster relief work, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be allowed to enter the disaster area if it is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aliya Ariyani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government said 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we could open up for international help but still have no position on it", he said.
As the second night on the Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami approaches, friends and families of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones may be miracles that brighten the dense story lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Jendron Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained the two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The people who were caught in Rowa Hotel are his students, including Mr. Mandi.
"As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Jendran recalled that within hours of the news of the Rowa Hotel collapse being broadcast in the paragliding community, he sent WhatsApp messages in a hurry to the participants of the beach festival.
His messages were replaced by a pair of blue check marks, but only one grey check mark.
"This means that the messages have not been delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 from an ATM during a refill at Levi's in Newport
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brinks workers on Friday morning while they were refilling an ATM in Newport.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was drunk, another man "walked out on the employee of the brink" and stole the money bag reserved for the delivery.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about his identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
On Twitter, he announced the change on Saturday, writing: "I am officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed "Ye" for some time and used the name for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to introduce her new album Yandy.
The creators of the show said that she was a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an acronym of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the term has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album on the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, it is we.
It has gone from the idea of monotheism, to just yes -- and this is a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West organizer, Jay-Z, also has hyphens and capitalizations added or missing.
Amlo of Mexico vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, as leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza, killing 300 people.
Lopez has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly stipends to those who study in the Obrador and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract youth to criminal gangs.
AI funding should be doubled by the US
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Although the US does not have an overall formal AI strategy, these notes come after various parts of the US government have made AI announcements.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan: aiming to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"As all other countries are far behind the US and we are exploring the next innovation in AI, doubling the AI research budget is a good start", Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being in the US.
Lee, whose book "AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which also invests in Phase++, one of China's leading AI companies.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that beat the American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China branch.
Lee received previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next inventor.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants.
"It's not China that's taking away the educational leaders; it's the corporates", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited scholars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy will also help the US to boost its AI efforts.
"I think that green cards should be automatically issued to PhDs in AI", he said.
The State Council of China launched its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said that the quality of academic work in China is poor, despite the fact that the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the United States provide funding to US researchers.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established a joint artificial intelligence center, which was intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion in its initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation attempting to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no progress in several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked membership attempts to the European Union and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has been claiming the name of its northern neighbor as a claim to its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised doubts whether the referendum will meet the minimum 50 percent required for it to be valid.
The question in the referendum is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by ratifying the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Jev, argue that it is a price to pay to enable Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the repression of Yugoslavia, to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it is the foundation of a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
He said that even though the law does not require it, enough members of Parliament are committed to making the outcome of the vote decisive.
A change in name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1 pm no irregularities were reported.
However, in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots, compared to 34 per cent who cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjoz Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Jaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kvarderkov would set up a small stage and place chairs in front of the tents set up by the referendum boycotters.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join not through the back door, but with our heads up", Kavdarkov said.
"We are a poor country but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can join with others like China and Russia as part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Jave said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority is in favour of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Jave said after casting his ballot.
He said that the result of "Yes" is "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - less than the required voting.
Another poll by Macedonian Telema TV found that 57 percent of people were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
A referendum needs 50 per cent of the people and one vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum represents the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defence for the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shot down Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero made it very easy to see in his own goal, scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield early in the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before attacking in the open field.
The Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around one defender and then overtook even more men at the end of Brighton's box.
Then there was Sterling when he pushed the pass to the left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to trick Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan into hitting the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We have talked about playing them for 55, 60 minutes.
Now it is.
It was lucky that they scored a goal in that moment".
However, it was Stirling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League campaign.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent a beautiful throw ball for the length of the left flank to Leroy San.
Before taking Sterling to the far post, Sun took a few touches.
The Sky Blue forward, just before the drop, threw the ball into the net.
City will face Haffan Heem in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sine Heem, Germany.
Spoilers vs. Sherger wants to play for the Rockies
With the Nationals out of playoff contention, there was little interest in another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, wants to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, and the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, have a play-off implication.
The Rockies received a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to win their first division title.
Even though we're just playing, with people feeling the atmosphere of Denver, I can stick my finger in the rubber, and other teams are playing at the highest level I can face this year.
Why should I not compete in it?
The Nationals are due to announce another starter for Sunday, but, in such a scenario, it is likely that Scherzer will be allowed to pitch.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, has started the bullpen session on Thursday and will take a rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump leads in West Virginia
The Supreme Court has implicitly referred to the controversy over his choice Brett Kavanaugh, the president, when speaking about the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections.
"We will see the results of all our work in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
This is very important. I am not contesting this election, but I am contesting an election. That is why I am fighting for the candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You're looking at a very scary situation. You're looking at a bunch of hateful Democrats. You're looking at what's happening now.
They are ready to seize power by any means, even the most humble.
They ride on whoever they want to get power and control, to hurt whoever they want to hurt, but we don't give them power.
He said the Democrats were using a "resistance and disruption" strategy.
"You have seen for the last four days" that the Democrats are "dirty and mean and nasty and dishonest".
He also mentioned the name of Sen. Diane Feinstein, a leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"Do You Remember?" was her reply.
Did you leak the record?
Oh, oh what.
No, no, no, his body language was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerance to speak your mind
When the activists of my local party Momentum voted for me, it was a real surprise.
I am the latest addition to the list of Labour MPs who have thrown us out for speaking our minds.
My MP colleague, Joan Ryan, has been treated in the same way for speaking out against Jewish bigotry.
In my case, the censorship office criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy had disagreements with previous leaders on issues such as responsible economic policy, national security, the importance of Europe, and other issues.
The Nottingham East Labour's Friday meeting notice said: "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
As a local Labour MP, I have seen the GC meeting on Friday night as it has for the last eight years.
Sadly, today's meeting was not like the voices of most other meetings. The promise of "gentle, moderate" politics has been forgotten.
There is a growing intolerance of dissent in the Labour Party, and every opinion is considered on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It's just that Jeremy is becoming a leader, and in everything, whether it's national security or the European Union or the single market, I, and my colleagues who have shared similar views in the past, are now expecting a change of heart.
Whatever I say, whenever I speak in public, there is a barrage of insults on social media, saying that I should be abandoned, that I am hurting the politics of the Centre and that I should not be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues that the comments made about me were politically motivated.
I am amazed at the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who face sexual or racial abuse every day and never give up.
The most boring thing about politics of this time is that the low level of violence has gone unnoticed.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, we don't have that broad mindset yet, and we're getting smaller with every "doubt" posture or policy shift.
I have received a lot of advice in the last two years that I should keep my head down, not talk too much and that I should have an "everything is fine" mindset.
But I have not come to do politics for this.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, I have opposed the neglect of the Thatcher government which destroyed an entire classroom, and played a significant role in providing better public services to those in need, whether it was a local councillor or a government minister.
I have not hidden anything in my politics, including the last election.
There is no confusion in Nottingham East about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the stance on Friday, I would say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect families, businesses and our public service, I don't see the need to spend my time and effort demonstrating my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But whether I am a Nottingham Momentum or not, rather than a Labour Party member, the message to the people of my constituency is this: I am proud to serve you and will not be deterred by threats of recall or political expediency from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
AYR 38 - 17 Merlos: undefeated AYR lead
Two late attempts seem to have had some effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that the AYR deserved an unprecedented win in Tennant's entertaining Premier Ship Day match.
They are now in the lead, and they are the only ones who have not lost in ten.
In the end, it was his defensive rush and his ability to get chances that made the home side and coach Peter Murchie happy at every turn.
"We have played so far and we have not been beaten. I am happy about that", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose says: "Congratulations to the AIR, they took better chances than us".
Grant converted a 14-minute effort by Frazier Climo to send the AYR forward, but the Scots captain Rory Hughes's yellow card turned the game towards the Warrior, and allowed Melrose to make the numbers, and Jason Baggott got the unconverted try.
Climo had to penalise AYR, with a converted solo try to make it 17-5 to AYR by the break before the interval.
However, Melrose started well after the interval, and the Bagot converted Patrick Anderson-Trey narrowed the gap by five points.
After playing too late, Rouride was injured and had to be stretched off, and when the restart was made, Climo converted a Stafford McDowell tray to the AYR lead.
AYR's interim captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and had to pay an extra man-of-the-match for Melrose's unconverted try at the end of the rebound for Bruce Calvin.
Strovan had a yellow card to Climo without the ball, but the home side was sent back from the penalty line, and McPherson was blocked from carrying the AYR forward.
Clemm converted David Armstrong's box kick as he had done when he sent Greer Henry to Flanker for a five-trick home-side to Kyle Rowe.
Still Game Star is looking forward to a new opportunity in the restaurant industry
After learning that he has been named a director in a licensed restaurant company, Still Game star Fort Keeran looks forward to making a foray into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he has written the script and stars alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hempfille.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last, and it seems Kearnan is thinking about his life after Craigslist.
According to the official record listing, he is a director of Adrift Morning Limited.
The Scottish Sun sources have reported that the actor has refused to comment on the news, although sources have said he wants to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade".
'The sea is ours': Bolivian island hopes court can reopen highway to Pacific
The naval headquarters at La Paz is guarded by the Navy.
The blue flag of the sea is flying over government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are committed to this motto: "The right of the sea is ours.
It is our duty to recover it".
The island of Bolivia was lost to Chile in a war in the 19th century. Thus, Bolivia's desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean is still in force.
After five years of trial, Bolivia is looking forward to the International Court of Justice's verdict on October 1.
"Bolivia has a spirit and a purpose of integrity, so we expect a positive outcome", Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Bolivians across the country are watching the ICJ ruling on big screens. Bolivia hopes that the tribunal in The Hague will decide, after decades of negotiations, whether Chile should negotiate a transfer of maritime sovereignty to Bolivia.
Bolivia's popular president, Evo Morales, who is seeking re-election next year amid a contentious struggle, also has high hopes for Monday's decision.
"We are close to the process of reclaiming the Pacific Ocean", he said last August.
But, according to some analysts, it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and even if the court does, the change is minimal.
The UN council in the Netherlands has no authority to decide on the Chilean territory and cannot predict the outcome of any possible talks.
The ICJ's decision comes six months after the final arguments, and Chilean Paz Zarate, an expert in international law, said that "this case is not complicated".
The situation of the last four years has not been conducive to Bolivia's objective.
"The Bolivian regime hijacked the problem of access to the sea", says Zarate.
She says Morales's statements have eroded the remaining respect for Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate in one scenario, but after that it will be very difficult to negotiate.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The Bolivian delegation at The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodríguez Velázquez, has rejected the allegation that the court's decision-making process was suspiciously fast.
"Monday's verdict will provide an opportunity to forge a new relationship with Chile and put an end to 139 years of mutual discord", he said.
Calzadeilla denies that Morales, still the most popular president in Latin America, is using the issue of the ocean for politics.
"Never give up the opportunity that Bolivia has access to the Pacific Ocean", he said.
"This verdict is an opportunity to set things right".
North Korea says that denuclearization is not possible without trust in the US.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong said that North Korea would never destroy a nuclear weapon if it did not first trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the US to follow through on the commitments made by the leaders of both countries at the Singapore meeting.
His comments came in the wake of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's statement that he expects to resume nuclear diplomacy three months after his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that it was only a dream that North Korea could be defeated by US objections to the position of ending the Korean War while maintaining the sanctions.
Without Pyongyang disarming first, Washington is cautious about declaring a treaty
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, it is widely believed that the Pyongyang will rebuild its weapons as it believes that it only needs weapons for its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Coming to your local High Street, a glamorous headline unveiled at the Paris Fashion Show.
If you want to change your hat collection or to block the sun, don't look back.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled their unique large-size SS19 collection in a stylish set at Paris Fashion Week.
The strangest hats were popular on Instagram this summer and caught the attention of designers, as well as catwalkers.
Valentino has created a design that resembles a cloak with a wide wing-like circumference that adorned the heads of the models.
Other large-size accessories include fancy melon, leopard hat, and pineapple. However, they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the attractive masks are lip-sewn and look more like a Hannibal Lecter than a Hatha Kocher.
One of the creations is a scuba diving gear with a snorkel and goggles, and the other is an ice cream cone with a melted mask.
And if you're a big fan of fashion, you'll find your favorite here.
The style lovers predicted that it would draw you to the nearest high street because of the attractive bonnets.
Larger hats are in the La Bomba style. A two-foot-wide brimmed straw hat can be seen on everyone's head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The unconventional cult label hat has caused a huge social media buzz, even catching on catwalk. The straw beach bag is as big as a swimsuit model.
The Burnt Orange Rafia bag features a raffia fringe and has a white leather handle. It is a unique product of the collection of Jacques La Riviera S S 19 at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told the Female: 'I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the high street by next summer. Designers have made a huge impact, and it's impossible to ignore the demand for big-size accessories.'
John Edward: A global citizen needs language skills
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence and in 2018 this was further enhanced by another unique test result, which was reinforced by individual and cumulative success in sports, arts, music and other community contexts.
The schools, which have a total of 30,000 children in Scotland, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and seek to provide a high quality of service to their children and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare children for higher education, for their chosen profession, and to grow into global citizens.
In the educational sector designing and implementing the school curriculum, we can observe that modern languages are constantly becoming popular and a subject in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to a person in his own language, it goes to his heart.
It reminds us that when we want to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries, we should not rely on English alone.
From the latest exam result this year, we can see that the languages with the highest pass rate are the ones that are ranked highest in the independent schools.
68 per cent of children who studied a foreign language achieved a higher grade of A.
According to data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, 72 per cent of Mandarin students achieved the top grade A, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students achieved the A grade.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland are encouraging children and young people to learn foreign languages as a key skill for the future, without any doubt.
Languages are now considered as a subject of choice in the independent school curriculum and elsewhere as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of people have a language skills gap, making it difficult for employers to fill jobs.
Thus, more and more language skills are essential for young people to shape their careers.
Language skills are needed for more jobs and have become a necessity in a globalized world.
If someone chooses to learn a second language as a second language, regardless of the profession, they will have the real advantage of having this type of lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will naturally put you ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of people do not speak a foreign language when they converse, and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, or 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
If there are many languages in developing countries, it provides a good opportunity for children to find better employment.
Every school in Scotland teaches different languages.
While many schools focus on classical modern languages, as of 2020, others teach languages that are most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools always have many languages to choose from and have teachers who are experts in these languages.
Scottish independent schools are specialised in providing a learning environment and they build an environment that develops the skills necessary to succeed and prepares children, whatever their future.
There is no denying that language will continue to be the most important factor in the global business environment and this should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages are really international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and expertise to the young people of Scotland.
This is the way to go.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will start Sunday for the Lakers in San Diego.
Fans' expectations for LeBron James' first game at the Los Angeles Lakers are finally over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
"It's probably more than one but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James may play for limited minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked what the plan was for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to be ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has started campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies next week, with locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
After his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump now intends to seek support as Republicans risk losing control of the House when the midterm elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling Rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
The issue has become so sensitive that the Senate is expected to withhold confirmation of those who are under FBI investigation for sexual misconduct.
But the primary priority of these rallies is to galvanize Republicans in the November elections.
The five rallies over the next week are therefore seen as a way to encourage volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and House.
Since controlling parliament is central to his agenda, Trump wants to enter as many states as possible and thus keep himself very busy during the campaign season, a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The tonight rally scheduled at the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling may also invite Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and receive coverage from Pittsburgh media, West Virginia MetroNews reports.
Trump is visiting West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, a state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump has tried to help the Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is being defeated in the election.
Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters that the fact that Trump had to come for the election campaign was not a good sign for Morris.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA worked hard to keep the hopes alive, facing singles on Sunday
After three overlapping sessions, the Saturday afternoon quadruple was needed for the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum-like situation had made the sport completely different, but it was a competition that the athletes really believed in and competed in.
So, which way does the wind seem to be blowing now?
"They were six points ahead, but now it's down to four, so we're just a little bit ahead", said Jordan Spieth.
Europe is definitely ahead by four points, with twelve more to go.
Speeth says Americans feel they have less air on their side and need to be encouraged by a lot of things. Speeth and Justin Thomas have been all day, each down four to three points.
He has played his role from tee to green and has been a role model.
A shout of celebration was heard as he went round. When he and Thomas both fell two after two, the match went into a complex phase in all four rounds.
His putt produced the same outcry as the winning 15th, indicating that the U.S. team was not out.
"It shows that you are very worried about your match", said Speeth.
That is why all the players have left.
There are now 18 holes to reach.
The only players to score more than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legends.
Europe's weird but favorite pair are in a four-by-four and they can't do anything wrong.
The only couple from Maliwood who did not shoot the Saturday afternoon buggy, they left the buggy early Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and returned home at nine on Friday morning.
That run and the energy they have is a sign that the players will win the match on Sunday, and the people are supporting it. It is clearer that Europe will win than Fleetwood or Molinaire when the sun sets on Le Golf National.
In different holes at the same time.
It is not right to talk about a European victory now.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did the short work for Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine encouraged the Spaniard and swelled to the hole as never before.
Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
Four balls and four sums are very interesting to watch because the communication between the pair and the advice they give and the advice they give and the changing strategy is very important.
Europe as a team played well and made a significant headway on the final day. However, this four-a-side session showed that Team USA has the ability to make a fight that was in doubt.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe won a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead over the United States in Four Balls and Four Sum on Saturday.
The pair, encouraged by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, have so far reached four points in Le Golf National, with two wins against Tiger Woods, who is trying to match Talley.
Thomas Bjorn's Europeans are trying to reclaim the trophy after losing at Hazeltine two years ago. The series is 3-1 after the Americans missed fire in the morning's four ball.
The US For Sum showed more resistance and won two matches, but they could not overcome the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points to retain the trophy from Sunday's 12 singles match.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four matches, after Maliwood and Molinari in the remarkable weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the Four Balls, the American rookie Bryson DeCambeau and Woods were defeated by an even more impressive 5-4.[1]
Woods, who lost two matches on Saturday, often played expertly. However, he has lost 19 of 29 matches in the Four Balls and Four Sum and lost seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's four balls, came up alongside Henrik Stenson in the for sum to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1 and are ranked first and third in the world.
The road to Europe was not easy. He also lost in Paris South West.
Three-time major winner Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
Spain's Jon Ram and Lan Poulter won 2-1 at Four Balls and beat Poulter and Rory McCall Roy 4-3 at Four Sam after losing the opening two holes.
In the Ryder Cup, only twice has a four-point deficit been scored in singles.
After being the second favorite in two days, every Sunday attack seems to be more than that.
North Korea has said that it will not destroy weapons for any reason without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the ban violates their faith in the United Nations and that it is impossible for their country to destroy nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Speaking at the UN Annual General Assembly, Ri Yang Ho said that North Korea has taken many "good steps" in recent years, including halting nuclear and missile tests, shutting down a nuclear test site and making a pact to phase out nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any response from the US on this.
If there is no trust in America, there is no trust in our national security and in such a situation, we will not be the first to destroy nuclear weapons spontaneously.
Ri noted that North Korea has complained about Washington's resistance to North Korea's proposal to phase out its nuclear weapons, and that his statement that he is not opposed to nuclear disarmament as he has been in the past is significant.
Citing a joint statement issued by the current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, Ri said that Kim had pledged to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and that the US was committed to the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
The US has refused to lift the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
Ri said that the US is first encouraging the destruction of nuclear weapons, but is increasing pressure through the ban to achieve their goal.
The dream of those who do not know us is that we will be on our knees because of the ban.
But the problem is that the continuation of the bans is increasing the trust between us.
Ri made no mention of a second meeting between Kim and Trump, as US leaders noted earlier this week at the UN.
Highlighting the highlights of the three talks between South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Kim in the last five months, the Minister said, "The US is not the main actor in this proposal for denuclearisation, but South Korea, and the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a complex stage.
However, the tone of the speech was completely different from last year's speech at the UN, which was thrown into a dilemma when the evil President Trump called Kim a "rocket man" who was on his way to commit suicide after North Korea targeted the US with its rockets.
Trump, who last year said he would "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim's courage at the United Nations this year to destroy the nuclear weapons, but said there was still much work to be done and the embargo would continue until North Korea was destroyed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a timeframe for this, saying it would take two years, three years, or five years, no matter.
China and Russia are arguing that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "We must continue to vigorously enforce Security Council sanctions until we have a complete, final, verified nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but this last trip was not the best for him.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, as he had been denounced for making "pirate-like demands" on North Korea within hours.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that it would demolish the missile site and nuclear complex if the US took "appropriate measures".
Kim said that in Singapore, Trump had told her of the security assurances he was looking forward to, as well as the "responsive measures" and expressed interest in continuing a good relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest
A new course is starting this year at Harvard University to combat the growing macho culture in undergraduate studies that is causing too much sleep due to caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
Students who have been educated in the best universities in the world do not have a basic understanding of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Sessler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to do this course after a speech on the harmful effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, a girl asked: 'Why is this being told to me after all these years, when I am a senior student?'
I was surprised when she said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was implemented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the school, said the school decided to introduce the course after seeing students sleep deprived for weeks.
Longer courses will include interactive activities.
One section features a picture of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insomnia affects sports and the importance of bedtime.
Another section explains how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about the daily routine.
We know that it doesn't change the behavior of students immediately.
We believe that just as you have the right to know the consequences of your choice to smoke, you have the right to know about your sleep, Professor Seisler said.
While the culture of bragging about reading all night long still exists, sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
He said that good quality sleep should be the secret weapon of students to fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and also help in avoiding weight gain, and that lack of sleep makes the brain hungry, which is why it is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Seisler design the course and took one of his classes in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that the course was eye-opening and inspired him to start courses across the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Students should set an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue lights' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights. These lights will emit your circadian rhythm from the kilter, and thus cause sleep problems, Professor Seisler recommends.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Gerrard's team defeated by Menga goal
Steven Gerrard's Rangers continued their losing streak with another 1-0 loss to the club in the match at Livingston, which was followed by a goal from Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox side were trying to record their first win since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side suffered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, as his side lost the league and Premier League leaders Hearts by eight points.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers, who played without spirit, did not seem to match at any moment.
Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston up to third and just a goal behind Hibernian.
Linesman Calum Spence is being treated for a head injury from a long-range throw. This is another blow to the Rangers team.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that led Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, had kept the same Livy 11 that had scored a point from the Hearts last week. He was delighted that his well-prepared team had beaten opponents at every turn.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston made the most of the opportunity.
Menga's first lay-off was when Scott sent the pitman through Alan McGregor's goal, which was to have taken only two minutes but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs got the skipper Craig Hallett after a free-kick but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was just hitting in the back post.
Although the Rangers maintained control, their final third game looked more promising than believable.
Alfredo Morelos felt that a quarter-hour mark penalty should have been awarded because of the conflict between him and Steven Lales, but the judge, Steven Thompson, did not consider Columbia's appeals.
The Rangers were only able to target two first-half strikes but were hampered by Former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's header and an Owi Ezharia strike by Lassanna Koulibali.
Livy's 34th-minute starter may be against the running game, no one can deny he deserves it.
Again the Rangers failed to counter Jacob's deep set-piece.
When Declan Gallagher slapped the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield did not respond, waiting for the manga to pick up for a plain ending.
Gerrard switched the quarterback for Ryan Kent during the break and this had an immediate effect as the winger made a slot at Morelos but the imposing Kelly ran out of his line to block.
But Livingston continued to play the game that the spectators loved with big big shots from Lithgow and Holqueth.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final stages but MacGregor stood up to deny Jacob before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late-ball claim from a dispute with Jacob but again Thompson was sidelined.
Panchang: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiser was born in Germany.
Geiser invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, eventually the device became known as the Geiser counter
Since then, the Gaiser Counter, a staple of science, has become a staple of pop culture, as did the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the molecules that are released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Now tell me, are you really kidding me?"
"Hans" Geiser died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
This invention has made his name live on.
A new cancer vaccine may boost immunity to disease cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the disease cells to become immune and destroy them
As part of treatment, vaccines help the immune system to identify malignant cells
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from a patient and replacing them in a laboratory
They can then re-inject a very common protein for many cancers.
The pilot vaccine is showing promising results in cancer patients.
A woman who received a vaccine treatment that teaches the immune system to identify disease cells has seen her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory so that they can give the normal protein HER2 to multiple cancers, and then re-inject it.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "'The results show that we have a very promising vaccine.'"
HER2 "drives the progression of a number of cancers", explained Jay Berzofsky, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
'Learning' to take immune cells from patients and target them against cancer cells has helped in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Trump's support from Kanye West, who wore a mega hat after SNL.
It wasn't good.
On Saturday night, Kanye West was booed by the audience for praising US President Donald Trump on live and saying he should run again in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, he wore a Make America Great cap at Ghost Town, mocked the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
'When I spoke to white people, they asked me many times: 'Why do you like Trump, he's not a racist?'
If I cared about racism, I would have left America.'
SNL began with a skit by Matt Damon in which Brett Kavanaugh satirized the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a sexual assault allegation by Hollywood star, Christine Blasi Ford.
Although it was not a broadcast, a video of West's satire was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether West was trying to rock him by posting.
He also said that he found it difficult to justify his hat in the West.
'He bullied me behind the scenes.
He said, 'Don't wear a hat on the stage.'
He was a man who had a lot of experience in the field of medicine.
I'm not in a good mood,'" he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West also said: 'Do you want to go on stage in the same mood?' 'You can't tell me whether or not I should wear this Superman cap, I asked if you want me to go on.
I have seen the love of my life.'
His statements were condemned by the audience at least twice and the SNL cast members were humiliated. Variety reported that one of the cast members said: 'The whole studio has been silenced'.
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Dressed as a perrier bottle, West surprised many with his song I Love It.
The conservative group TPUSA supported West. Cadence Turner tweeted: 'For the brave souls: Thank you for performing at a group level.'
But Karen Hunter tweeted, "Simply put, West was as good as he was".
'But I don't believe in supporting a person who advocates an idealism that is harmful to my community (such as buying their music or clothing or supporting their 'art').
They are free.
We too", he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that his name was now officially Kanye West.
He was not the first person to change his name, but diddy, puff daddy, puffy or p diddy also changed their names.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion. Similarly, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then reverted to his original name of Prince.
A murder charge over a Belfast restaurant shooting
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Belhihakamore, police said.
On Monday, the accused will appear before the Magistrates' Court in Belfast.
The Public Prosecution Service will review the allegations.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington kicked off against the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-wielding elder in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, Macho, has spoken out against the concept of heroes, saying that because of such roles on screen, boys often face the situation of thinking that they will get respect only if they are tough.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt "something was wrong" and that action was needed against toxic masculinity in today's #MeToo era.
Kit, who is married to Rose Leslie, 31, a co-star of his Game of Thrones series, said he intends to address the issue.
He felt that when he felt strongly about this personally, there was something wrong with masculinity.
'What do we teach boys as they grow up? Does this have anything to do with the problems we see today?'
He said that the reason why television has grown to this level of toxic masculinity is because of the male characters in it.
He went on to say: What is inspiration and what is doctrine?
What is it about TV and the streets that makes young boys feel like men?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time. How do we change it?
I'm telling you, something is wrong with these boys.'
In an interview, he said that he would not be bothered by any Game of Thrones when the sequel ends next summer. He said that the battlefields and the horse scenes had bored him.
From November, Kit will star in the sequel to Sam Shepherd's True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his gangster brother.
He said he wanted to meet his wife Rose to get out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show. So this way it provided me with my future family. From here my life started to change,' he said.
Rose Kit was portrayed by John Snow as a love interest, a vignette, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
Jodi and Leslie were married in June 2018 at their family's estate
HIV/AIDS: China sees a 14% increase in the number of AIDS cases
China has increased the number of people living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
More than 8,20,000 people are infected with AIDS, officials said.
In the second quarter of 2018, more than 40,000 cases were reported.
The significant change is that the majority of cases are found to be caused by sexual contact.
Traditionally, blood transfusions have been the main source of HIV transmission in China.
Chinese health officials in Yunnan state said the flow of AIDS has been almost brought to zero by this method.
Year-over-year, China has seen a 100,000 increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
In the LGBT community in China, HIV, which is transmitted through sexual contact, is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people continues.
This is due to the country's traditional values. Studies show that about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Diseases are spread in such relationships because of lack of proper protection.
Since 2003, China has provided universal access to HIV medicine to eradicate the problem.
Maxine Waters, who says GOP senators did not leak, blasts the 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy allegations'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday railed against allegations that one of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican senators and laymen on Wikipedia pages.
He said that right wing pundits and websites are spreading propaganda.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said that the "lies, lies and more vicious lies".
The released information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Arin Hatch of Utah.
The information was found online on Thursday, and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after Kavanagh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites Gateway Pandit and Red State reported that the IP addresses indicated that the source of the posts was Waters Office and that Waters staff members had published the content.
'This anonymous allegation is completely false and malicious,' Waters said.
He said that the identity and security of my staff members would be compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations and that I am in no way responsible for this leak.
'This anonymous allegation is completely false and malicious,' he said.
Waters' statement was immediately met with online criticism. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was among those who criticized it.
'This rejection is outrageous,' Fleischer wrote.
This shows that Waters is not eligible to be a member of Congress.
There is no need to get angry if someone is falsely accused.
They don't have to be so aggressive.
He does not have to say that the accuser is malicious.
They should be calm and patient.'
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrat's criticism of Justice Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh appeared to be very angry by Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, shared his thoughts on Twitter.
'This is big news in Satyavendha,' he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that the fraud claims have been reported to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies.
'The people behind this incident will be exposed,' Waters said, 'and those who have acted in a manner destructive and dangerous to my staff will be held accountable for their actions.'
Johnny English Strikes Again review - The spy film by Rowan Atkinson
The British cinema is as it is today. The Brexit issue is not going to be a big part of it. The comedy of the series Johnny English is also a big part of it.
Is it ironic self-deprecation about the fact that we have clearly performed poorly as the nation's new export leader?
In any case, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has a license to update his material for the second time - a name that suggests he designed the comic structure for non-English-speaking cinemas, above all else.
He is of course a Daft Secret Agent who has had a bit of a comeback despite his bizarre pretensions to glamour, as evidenced by his early contribution to Mr. Bean's ragas and a note of the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He is basically the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials' international figure of the mystery Actinson, who has confused people by waking up.
There are one or two happy moments in this recent JE tour.
As I approached Johnny English's helicopter, I was really pleased to see the medieval suit he was wearing and the rotor blade that was rolling near him.
Atkin Sun, gifted with physical humor, was now performing, but the humor seemed powerless and eccentric, especially compared to "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible, which now exactly offer humor as a part of the plot.
The humor in it seemed to be more aimed at children than adults, and I felt that the mischief of Johnny English was uncreative and unfocused and that the character of Bean was focused on the morbidity of Atkin's son in the manner of a silent film.
Now the more topical premise is that Great Britain is in deep trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret web network, revealing the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, much to the dismay of agents on duty.
This would be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and courageous man, already suffering from a complete meltdown from political infamy: Emma Thompson does her best work with this quasi-Theresa-May character but there is nothing much to work on the script.
Since every secret agent has been compromised, her intelligence advisors tell her that she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
The main implication of this is that Johnny English, who now works as a school teacher in some luxury institution, is being bullied, but without documentation, about how to operate in secret: some of the best jokes about this is that it provides a school like the Rock-type academy of English intelligence.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency explanation and is merged with the long-suffering sidekick Bow, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Beau is now a married man who has hit the Submarine Commander, a role played by Jali-Hawkey-Sticks, in which Vicky Pepper is a bit of a waste.
As Batman and Robin have made terrible mistakes on Her Majesty's Secret Service, Olga Kurylenko is faced with the beautiful Femmi Fatale Ofelia Buletova.
Not only that, but the Prime Minister is under threat from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: Synecdoche Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bowe begin their act of satirical hi-jinks as waiters who set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle in a luxury yacht on the Volta; and the Volta induces the pure English anarchy to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of the house.
That last sequence definitely takes out all the stops, but it's friendly and lively.
It's a very moderate thing.
And I couldn't think, like other Johnny English films: Can't the British film industry really do justice to Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Britain is working on a plan to pay for four days a week but five days, and the workers are refusing to do that.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but paid for five.
The party wants company bosses to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees an extra day off.
This is where you see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - yet taking home the same amount of pay.
The idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in the workers' favour, sources said.
The Trades Union Congress has approved a change to four days a week as workers take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'Such work does not happen overnight but the four-day work week is a party approach to balance the economy in favour of the workers and is in line with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Green Party had pledged four days of work a week during its 2017 general election campaign, so Labour would not be the first to endorse such an idea.
However, this ambition is not fully endorsed by the current Labour Party.
As one Labour party man put it: 'A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonell has worked hard to push the vision of socialist revolution in the economy through a labor conference last week.
Mr. McDonnell said that the decision was taken to take back the power from the 'faceless directors' and 'beneficiaries' in the utility companies.
Shadow Chancellor plans that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full stake back, as the Labour government can make 'reductions' based on perceived fault.
He secured a plan to incorporate workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds for private sector firms to hand over 10 per cent of shares to employees, who pocket an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graha, John Kennedy says "60 Minutes", as if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would change their minds.
An FBI investigation into allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, and has raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could motivate any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could catch anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more free than his South Carolina counterpart.
"That means, whatever", Kennedy said.
"I said that I was going to trial, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that charge came out, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unwavering".
However, Ghamam's determination was as firm as a rock.
"My mind is made up about Brett Kavanagh and it takes a charge of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it, citing Christine Bresley Ford.
"And everyone they named was not verified to them.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and have you done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York hosts the Global Civilization Festival, an annual concert showcase of stars and an equally impressive mission; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Civilization Festival will celebrate Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Day, declared in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to complete a number of tasks or volunteer, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has global civilization been when it has been 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is the thought process of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade people for a call, or is it another case of what is called "click vision" - people thinking they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Civilization claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, which have different goals.
It said these actions have helped to motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion with the aim of impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that safe funds have directly impacted some 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments of Nutrition for Nutrition, a Russia-based partnership that "helps investors and their implementers raise children", which promises to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens. Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Russian government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
After the Russian government took more than 5,000 actions to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions, the group said.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website, "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's Answer: "It's a very long and difficult path - sometimes we stumble and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Monie will perform at this year's event in New York, which is hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as "blockade" to impede Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Secretary Ray Ginkley revealed that Washington will use its US Navy in the interior "if necessary" to hide Russian power in markets, including the Middle East, as the Washington Examiner put it.
Russia's involvement in Syria, mainly because it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - a pretext to explore new powerful markets, alleged the deer.
"I believe they want to be in Eastern Europe, in the middle of southern Europe, as a mediating power because they are in the Middle East", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"With our Navy, the United States has the ability to make sure that the sea lanes are open and to blockade if necessary, to make sure that their power does not go to market", he said.
Zincke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Power Alliance, which describes itself as the "voice of consumer power" in America.
He went there to compare Washington's methods in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were effectively identical.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is more or less to control and substitute fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "a smart horse" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has replaced Russia with the intention of exporting its liquefied natural gas to Europe, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that effect, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, was a "prisoner" of Berlin and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of dishonest competition.
I believe we share the view of Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, who after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, said that Russia cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers.
The US stance has been met with backlash from Germany, which has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a big problem when a third state interfered in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator says Elizabeth Warren had "hard labor" when running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would face "hard labor" running for president after the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and the issue of women holding a better position", she told Hill.
"After November 6, I will work hard to run for president".
Warren pressed President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying, "He's taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I worry about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has spoken out publicly against Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "We need an FBI investigation before the vote".
In a poll released on Thursday, a majority of Warren's units showed that they do not plan to compete in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, fifty-eight percent of "probability" Massachusetts voters stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported such a contest.
A contest poll conducted by former Governor Deval Patrick showed the highest support at 38, with 48 percent of people saying potential driving and 48 percent supporting the idea of a car.
Other top Democratic names discussed regarding the 2020 eventuality include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would formally decide by January.
Sarah Palin has called for the removal of PTSD from the Trump administration.
Track Paulin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 26.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night
"I can relate to what my own son is doing, what he's doing after he's back, with other families who are experiencing the severity of PTSD and with the families of our soldiers who have come back wounded", he told the audience at a meeting for Donald in Lusa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called her confinement "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back with a firm mind, they wonder with reverence about what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military has contributed to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence, domestic violence against women, interfering with the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon during a report of domestic violence and rape, a Des Bennett Wasilla police department spokesman said.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to those fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a brief with the Friends of the Court in Washington on Friday to support those who challenge the policy and seek asylum, NBC News reported.
Grace v. Nassy Plentyff is the full name of an unsealed lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy in August.
She told her partner and children of his violent gang members that she had been abused, but U.S. authorities denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting GRACE described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that generate large numbers of applicants for U.S. asylum, as the nations face widespread problems with kidnapping and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who had not fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law", District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Recin said in a statement Friday.
The court's amicus brief stated that "all claims for asylum under federal law must be determined on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, and such a listing would violate that principle".
The lawyers argued briefly that the policy of denying immigrants entry would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential workers".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judge to no longer offer shelter to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution through race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said of the June 11 policy.
Ashlam will never be able to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day and even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue efforts in the search for survivors as the death toll in the race doubles
For the survivors, the situation was even more dire.
"It's very stressful", said mother Risa Kusuma, 35, as she comforted her son at a center for transferring a fevered infant to Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Clean water is very scarce".
The image was of residents returning to their destroyed homes, picking out their submerged household items, seeing if anything was worth using.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were flooded by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwai Harris, who suffered from a fracture of his back and shoulder, were laid to rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to lack of space.
He was crying with his wife and children, saying that the earthquake shook his fifth floor hotel room.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I got caught in the debris of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, saying his family was in town for a wedding.
"My wife was crying out for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' through propaganda ads
The US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US media to its advantage after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily describing the benefits of China-US trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of trying to influence the U.S. congressional elections that begin on November 6th, after a paid supplement to the Iowa Daily best-selling newspaper appeared on the Des Moines Register on Wednesday.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election is part of a push to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run newspaper ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war and have moved to increase tariffs on each other's goods.
Chinese and American manufacturers say China has imposed tariffs on American manufacturers in a way that would give an advantage to exporters in states like Iowa, which has supported Trump's Republican Party.
According to Terry Bryanstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, China has been a major agricultural exporter to China, and China has been taking advantage of American workers, farmers and businesses.
As Brian Staud wrote in Sunday's Des Moines Register, 'China is now trying to cook its own pie by advertising in our open newspapers.'
"The American tradition of open journalism has allowed China to bake a cake, as the advertisement in Des Moines Register demonstrates", writes Brian Stead.
"In contrast, if you visit China at a newsstand in the alley of Beijing, you will not find any comments against the plight of the economy, and the media, which is run under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
"One of the leading Chinese newspapers hesitated to publish my article", he said, without naming the newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans against voting for women in Kavanagh
As Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, is being defended by several top Republicans, analysts warn that he faces stiff opposition from voters, especially women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Sentiments on the issue are so high that most Republicans are officially saying they want to vote.
We can't back down on those issues", said Grant Recher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Senator Jeff Fleck said he doubted that the FBI's last-minute attempt to investigate would be enough to anger angry voters.
"Women may not be able to forget what happened yesterday - whether it's tomorrow or November", senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MovOn, Kerin Jean-Pierre, told the Washington, DC, daily on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters demonstrated in the Senate's hallway, shouting "November is coming!" However, Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination. Meek reported that Dr. Christine Blasey's statement was ignored.
"The Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation is unprecedented", said Stu Rothenberg, a conservative political analyst, to the news site.
"People are saying that this is already happening.
But it may be higher, especially among women who are switching parties and young voters, 18-29 years old, who live in the suburbs, who don't like the president, who often don't vote".
Analysts had said before Ford's public comments on the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee that Republicans may face stiff public opposition in the future to pursue the nomination.
"It's complicated as far as the GOP is concerned", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets on the bench, but how Republicans handled this and handled her", Guy Cecil, director of Priori USA, told the news channel.
Americans seem to be a little confused by the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, and most seem to be a little more pro-Ford.
A new poll by YouGov found that 41 percent of people trusted Ford, while 35 percent said they trusted Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of people think Kavanaugh lied during his interrogation, compared to 30 percent who think Ford might have lied.
The FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations after the Flake case was brought. The FBI has several other allegations against Kavanaugh, including one by Deborah Ramirez.
Ford has alleged before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he sexually assaulted her when she was 17 years old, in a drunken stupor.
Ramirez alleged that Cavanagh had exposed his penis while attending a party while they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Google and Facebook are the world wide web search engines
World Wide Web pioneer Tim Berners-Lee is set to launch a new startup that is set to take on Google, Facebook and Amazon.
Inrupt, a new project from technology legend Lee, is building a solid open source platform.
With Solid, users can control where data is stored and who can read what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of Inrupt was to "conquer the world".
"Let's do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic occasion".
Using Solid technology, people can create their own "personal online data store or pod".
This includes providing contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It works like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all in the same browser at the same time.
The unique aspect of personal online data store is that who should use what is entirely a matter of the user.
The company calls it 'personal empowerment through data.' "
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind InRoad is to provide the company with the resources, methodology and skills to make solid everywhere.
The company currently has a community of developers and volunteer coders who have been hired to work on the project, including Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, and a team of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the InRoft website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "don't talk about suddenly introducing a way for Facebook and Google to change all of their business".
"We don't have to ask their permission".
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee said, "InrapT aims to build a commercial capability and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web being built on solid ground".
In 1994, he started the revolutionary Internet with his research on the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been one of the most influential voices in the net neutrality debate in recent months.
While launching Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee says he is very optimistic about this next era of the Web.
Bernard Van: A memorial to the Victorian Cross winner of World War I
The priest, who was a recipient of the Victoria Cross in the First World War, was commemorated in his birthplace on his 100th birthday.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the Victoria Cross for the attack on Bellingly and Leichhoff on 29 September 1918.
But four days later he was shot dead from a distance behind the scenes. He was not left to enjoy the Victoria Cross, the highest military honour.
His granddaughter unveiled a memorial stone during a recital in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was symbolic that this statue was being erected in his memory 100 years after he received the Victoria Cross.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann marched with his battalion to the Canal de Saint-Quentin, where the enemy machine guns were firing a barrage of heavy fire in the dense fog.
He then went to the front line and single-handedly used his field gun to repel three enemy guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was shot by a German assailant from behind a curtain on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Vann, 72, said: "I can be very humble, but I cannot replicate what my grandfather has done in his life".
After the military parade, he laid the foundation stone with his brother Dr. James Van. The event was organised by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said, "It is an honour to be part of this event" and "It is a tribute to the bravery of the Appaata Hero and the support of so many people".
MMA fans who waited all night to see Belator 206 got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you have stayed up all night to watch Belator 206 but missed the main event.
Bill of San Jose had a total of 13 fights, including six on the main card and it was shown live on Channel 5 all night.
At 6am, when Gerard Moussy and Rory McDonald were getting ready to go on the air, the UK fans were shocked when Peppa Pig came on instead of the coverage.
Some of the fans who had been waiting till early in the morning for this fight were understandably angry.
A fan on Twitter railed about the children's cartoon show being aired as 'a bad joke'.
"The government's broadcasting policy was that the Fight show at 6:00 a.m. was inappropriate, so they had to broadcast the children's program", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator.
"Peppa the Pig, yeah".
Scott Cocker, President of Bellator, said that in the future he would be planning the programme with the UK audience in mind.
"It's my opinion that maybe we can set the replay time to fit the UK", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning. But we can't set it to our Sunday time, which is their Monday time.
We are trying to correct this.
Yes. They were all angry when we had to stop broadcasting.
We are trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical problem.
But this is not the case, they are following the instructions of the government.
I can assure you that next time this will not happen.
We can take it to five fights instead of six, we were doing five fights before, but we were wrong to think that our fans would have one more.
This is an unfortunate situation", he said.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly's infamy about sex is a little more than a little bit.
Tom Daley, an Olympic diver, says that he feels disrespect for his sexuality, but that it's what motivates him to achieve, and what led to his success.
He didn't realize that everyone was not like him until he was 24 years old and in secondary school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren LaVerne, she spoke about gay rights to provide hope to others.
He said that being a parent has made him less concerned about the Olympics.
Kirsty Yang, who regularly oversaw the show, took several months off.
Daly, who appeared as a cast member on Laverne's show, also said that liking boys and girls is not considered normal even though he feels inferior to others.
He says: "To this day, feeling inferior or different has given me the strength to succeed".
She wanted to create an environment where no one would feel anything even if they knew about their sexuality, when they wanted to show off.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT campaigner, pushing more countries to decriminalize homosexuality during the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said that he was happy to be living in freedom and working to inspire optimism in others.
In 2013, she fell in love with a man who was a surprise to her. The man was U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daly married Oscar winner Lance Black, who was 20 years older than her, last year, but she felt the age gap was not a big deal.
"I have had a lot of ups and downs in my life", recalls the 14-year-old, who won her first Olympic medal. Three years later, her father died of cancer.
The couple adopted a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley. This development changed the way Daley lived.
"If you had listened to me last year, I would have been talking about winning the gold medal.
"You know, there are things in life that are bigger than Olympic gold medals.
Robby is my Olympic gold medal".
He named his son Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly says that his father, Robert, did not want to die. He always asked if he could get a ticket to sit in the front row at the 2012 London Olympics.
"But how can you say that you can't be in the first line", Daley asks.
"I held his breath as if I held his hand. I thought he would hold on to life until his breath stopped. But when death became firm, I realized that he was not eternal".
Marvusha Daly won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"It has been my lifelong dream to dive for my country at the Olympic Games, and to win a medal there is the greatest feeling I can have".
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice, Heather Small's Proud, which not only resonated with the Olympics, but also filled the room with excitement.
Desert Island Discs was broadcast on Sundays at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
The Ryder Cup rest on Saturday for the losing Michaelson.
American Phil Michelson was scheduled to play his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to return to form if he wants to reach the milestone.
Michaelson, who is competing in the biennial tournament for a record 12th time, was rested by team captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's Four Balls and Four Sums.
The four-time major winner, who has been a standout for the United States and a star at the Raiders Cup, spent the day as a cheerleader and focused on improving his game.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old Lee, who never scored straight, was not a role model for the National Golf Course, which punishes long, rough, faulty shots.
Although the course is not that challenging, Michelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, having won all four of his matches with Tommy Fleetwood this week.
The Americans are four points short of starting 12 singles matches, and Mickelson's match will be a complete highlight in the hot start force.
Fury said nothing but expressed confidence in his teammate.
"Today they understood what their role was. They had my back and their arms around me and said they were ready for tomorrow's game", Furik said.
"They have a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past.
I didn't think he would play only two matches.
I thought I could win more, but it was like this, and we felt that it was the right decision.
He wants to stay here like everyone else".
Michelson is set to break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
This marked the end of a Ryder Cup career that did not match the height of his personal record.
Furyck stated that Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though his presence has brought some distortions to the team.
"He's funny, he's got a sense of humor, he likes to make people laugh, and he's a good guy on our team", explained the director.
The younger players used to have fun going to him, and even this week, I think it's a fun thing to watch.
They offer more than just a game.
Thomas Jorn, the leader of the European Commission, says that a large amount of lead is about to disappear.
European captain Thomas Jorn knows from experience that a key lead in the singles match on the final day of the Ryder Cup tournament can easily turn into an unpleasant ride.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the Save Ballesteros-led team scored five points over the Americans but only got a finish line to their nose in front by narrow margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"After seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 in the League of Golf National Championship, you'll remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only", Jorn said.
So history will show me and the rest of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow will be very boring for everyone.
Go out there and do the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have said everywhere, I will focus on the 12 players in my team, but we are well aware of what is on the other side, the best players in the world".
Jorn said that he was happy to see how his players performed on a tough golf course.
Tomorrow will be different.
The individual performances are coming up tomorrow, and it's something else to do.
It's good to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're out on your own, your potential as a golfer is put to the full test.
The message is that you should contact the players, you will get better results from them tomorrow.
For the time being, let your companions go and they have to go and expect the best from them".
In contrast to Bjorn, opposing number Jim Furik is performing better than he did as a partner, while Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored three out of four.
Furik himself was on either end of that last trade, part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser as Europe exited in "Madina at Medina".
"When I asked Ben Crane Shaw, who was captain in 1999, how he put his players together for the last day, I remember every bad word of it", he said.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start fast as you saw in the medina, as you saw in the brook line.
When you're fast like that, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle fights.
We'll adjust our line-up accordingly and we'll train the boys in the way we think, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter facing the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in the move because I think it's going to be a cover all the way through", Jorn said of his singles choices.
The new German battleship was delayed again
The new fleet of the German Navy was supposed to be deployed in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleships, but due to faulty systems and snowball cost, local media reported that it would not be possible until next year.
According to the newspaper Direct, citing military spokesmen, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates "Rhineland-Pfalz" has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to have joined the fleet in 2014, but some post-delivery issues spoiled the ambitious project's future.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class battleships.
They are known to contain powerful artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some covert technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include longer maintenance periods, which can be deployed from major local ports for up to two years.
However, because of the constant delays of the advanced battleships - which are said to allow Germany to project power abroad - they are already obsolete by the time they enter service, says Dirck.
Unfortunately the F125 battleship was refused last year to be kept as an official ship of the German Navy and made headlines by being returned to the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reason for the withdrawal was little known, but the German media noted that there were several critical "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the warship useless if deployed in combat.
The Baden-Wurnenberg class is operated by about 120 Navy sailors, so software deficiencies may have been a major part of the problem - it uses half the manpower of the older Bremen class.
Also, the ship is overweight which will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Pfalz" is believed to have been twice as heavy as the same-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the staff - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have increased from €2.2 billion initially to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
These difficulties are especially important in the face of new warships being acquired under recent warnings that the naval power in Germany is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was in fact "falling short of ships of deployment-capability".
The officer said that over time the problem grew like an ice ball as the old ships were scrapped but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were able to rejoin the fleet.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research is underway in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the terrain for their prey for food.
It is believed that the findings on the behavior of the unique flying mammals will shed new light and guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland followed common and soprano pipistrels, including brown long-eared and dubentone bats.
Special recorders are placed at key points of their movements to track the activities of bats in all seasons.
NHS staff and volunteers are also conducting surveys on mobile using hand-held detectors.
Expert voice analysis of all the recordings will confirm the bat's call frequency and what species is doing it.
A habitat map and report is made to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS nature conservation consultant Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the bats and how each species uses them.
This information helps determine the benefits of habitat management such as grassland creation and how to better manage woodlands for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work, which affects poultry and habitat loss.
Some chemicals in fly papers and building materials can cause damage, as well as wind turbines and lighting on pet cats can pose a risk.
Bats are not really blind.
However, since they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS is also very serious about bats, as it is responsible for overseeing over 270 historical buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
It has ten trained specialists who constantly conduct surveys, inspections and sometimes defence.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only reserve bat conservation centre at Threve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson says the estate is a good fit for him.
"We have a good area for bats in Thrive.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and all good habitats.
But we don't know enough about bats, so we're working here and helping other places understand more about what they need to do to thrive".
He stresses the importance of testing bats before conducting site management, as 400 female species and younger generations were lost, perhaps the entire population, without proper maternal care.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their offspring.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He says: "We still have to know about our bats and for many of our generations we don't know how their populations are going".
Ronaldo rejected a rape claim as lawyers sued against German Meg Jean
The claim of a rape against Cristiano Ronaldo was branded "fake news", with people using his name to "promote themselves".
His lawyers are prepared to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward are accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that he was alleged to have paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video with his 142 million followers just hours after the claims were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo said it was all "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. It's not the same.
He said that today, fake news, five-time Ballalen Divorce Winner told in front of the camera.
"They do this to spread my name and to promote themselves.
It's common.
They are using my name to make themselves famous, but this is part of the job.
I am very happy and all is well, just another player joined", he laughed.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel, which they have called "an inadmissible report about suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Skerts is seeking compensation for moral damages in an amount "proportional to the violation, which is one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years".
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, according to papers filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, Ronaldo and Majorca went back to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
After the alleged incident, Ronaldo came to my feet and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good guy".
Records say Ronaldo confirmed the couple had had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayagra went to the police and gave them photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she was shocked by the alleged incident and was now trying to cancel the settlement.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the allegations and had agreed a €100 million deal for Italian giants Juve this summer.
Brexit: the UK will forever mourn the loss of its car manufacturers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Barnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border delay of the No Deal Brexit event could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, which makes Toyota's Yaris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain is knocked out of the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about leaving the EU without any deal on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has said it will close its mini-plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The problem for carmakers is that there are risks to supply chain issues in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "only-time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
The industry says that if the UK leaves the EU on March 29 with no deal, there could be a disruption at the border due to delays and a lack of spare parts.
Toyota has said that it is impossible to keep a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We have to make a deal. We want to have the best deal that we can allow as I say to enjoy the current success", he told Today's Show on BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers that we should be fully capable of continuing the very successful supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, the extra costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately hurt jobs.
Peter Tsauvaleris, who worked at Barnaston for 24 years and was a union conveyor at the plant, said members were more concerned: "My experience is that once these jobs are lost, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
As the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, Donald Trump may "defer" a high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for another week, the White House said Sunday.
Due to Russian election interference, Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating links between Trump aides and Russia and obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump would take the deputy attorney general on a limb and risk Mueller's freedom for it has been a hotbed of Washington air for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House despite reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to shoot Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual abuse, have testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting, Rosenstein said: "There is no date set for it, it could be this week, I could see pushing it back another week given everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see it and I always want to keep the press updated".
Some reporters contest that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Rather than being a victim of a lack of attention, Sanders said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they're distracting".
He then suggested that there would be more direct contact between Trump and the newspaper.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president", he said, without citing evidence: "We've seen numbers like that".
Briefings still occur, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's infinitely more than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of that, and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and when you talk to the president of the United States, it's going to be in the press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
One-on-one press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York the president probably demonstrated with freewheeling and sometimes bizarre-looking reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express gratitude for the country and wish it to be in a post-Brexit position.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter of less than six months until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the costs of status applications settled for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letters, Miss Freeman wrote: "As the summer is over, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are continuing, with a decision expected this autumn.
But the UK government is ramping up its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize how much I value the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
The valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work will benefit colleagues in the EU and beyond, and the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would very much like you to stay".
Kristen Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after suffering a 31-27 loss to the Wonderbilt Commodores for a head injury, reported the Tennessean's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
"They came to the party, what a fall", Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen before coaches and medical staff put him on a stretcher and returned him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of the W.S.M.V. in Nashville, Tennessee, that he was out having a surgery on Abercrombie at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there were "no details yet on the extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Harris said "there are no details yet on the type/extent of the injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Under new Tory schemes, foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK with extra money to be used to help the homeless.
This move would neutralize the success of the Carbine drive to attract young voters.
Stamp duty increase for non-payers of taxes in UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - extra money being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide affordable housing to young voters and target high-income earners.
Stamp duty increases will be levied on individuals and entities that do not pay taxes in the UK, the government is set to impose additional money on those who do not pay.
The surcharge - which includes the higher levels and opportunities to buy introduced in second homes two years ago, in addition to the current stamp duty - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million pounds annually with this measure.
Non-UK residents buy 13 percent of new properties being built in London, making prices skyrocket and making it unaffordable for first-time home buyers to own their own flats.
As large numbers of foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, many of the country's wealthier areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns".
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused the big construction firms of squandering land and inflating property prices by not using it, and urged Mrs. May to cancel the quota of affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing scandal".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing reforms including rent control and ending "no-fault eviction".
He has demanded that councils be given more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring British love - life better for every new generation.
This means that we have to fix our housing market which is in a bad shape.
Britain is always open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, individuals and foreign-based companies who do not live in Britain cannot say that it is as easy to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For many people, homeownership has become a distant dream, while the dreary life of sleeping on the streets has continued".
Jack Ross: 'Managing Scotland is my ultimate ambition.'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said that his "ultimate ambition" is to manage Scotland at some point in his life.
The 42-year-old Scott, who has embraced the challenge of revitalising the North East club, is currently third in League One, three points behind the first-place finisher.
He returned to the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and it was like this", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hampden from a young age, and that's always been something that has stuck with me.
I will only get that chance if I am successful in managing the club.
Previous Sundarland managers have included Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Aloha Athletic chief says he had no qualms about joining such an established line of names at such a big club.
"How can I take this club back to the Premier League?" is the only criterion by which to measure this time.
There is no doubt that this is a Premier League club because of the structure and facilities at this club.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but if I can get the club back there, I feel I've succeeded here".
Rose has only had a managerial career for three years, serving as assistant head at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped recover Alloa, who had slipped to third place. By the following season, St Mirren had been converted from a relegation to a Championship title winner.
Rose says he now feels more comfortable than he did in his previous career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a really confusing time", he recalled of his time in Aloha.
"I honestly believed that management was better for me than playing.
It's weird because I've done it right, and I've earned a lot, and I've reached a lot of heights.
But it's really hard to play.
There are many things you have to do once a week.
I cannot escape from it in terms of work pressures and stress, it will continue. However, management seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel like it's the most comfortable thing I can do in my entire adult life".

The best time to have a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to the survey.
The summer heat has boosted sales in struggling Britain's pubs, but at the same time, it has increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales in pubs and bars were up 2.7 percent in July - but sales in restaurants were down 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of business consultancy `CGA`, which compiled the figures, said: "Due to the heat and England's longer than expected World Cup participation, pubs saw sales up 2.8 per cent in July, compared with the previous June, while restaurants faced even more difficult days.
The decline in restaurant business, which was 1.8 in June, was even more severe in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are the main selling point are doing better than restaurants in terms of business.
Even though the sun's heat has affected festivals where food is the main dish, it is not as serious as for restaurant owners.
It seems that people want to go out for a drink.
Alcohol sales in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent monthly while food sales decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analysts ∀RSM said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in an outdoor or out-of-home market, the influence of weather and major social or sporting events remains the biggest determining factor.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to be in a constant state of distress, for while sales are down 4.8 percent year over year, on the other hand, operating costs are rising.
The long summer should not have come on days when food-centric restaurants are in distress. Time will tell whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August provide the much-needed relief".
The total sales growth of all pubs and restaurants, including newcomers, in July was 2.7 per cent, reflecting the slowing of product launches by brands.
The 'coffee peach tracker' is now the established industry standard, collecting and analysing performance data from 47 management teams who track sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, totalling more than £9 billion in turnover.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that their parents don't know about
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - secretly have social media accounts without their parents and teachers knowing.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, are secretly creating social media accounts without the knowledge of adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students told their parents that they had a "pure" "main" account and that they had private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website says that the teenager insisted on social media that she "rape me".
In research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds said they had two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
As Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, puts it: "It is alarming that many teenagers are succumbing to the temptation to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Elide Doyle is the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Welcoming Doyle as Scotland's most popular track and field athlete, President Ian Beatty said that the broad experience of Elid at international level over the last decade was a great opportunity to take advantage of the sport's mentorship.
"Elid is held in high regard in Scotland, the UK and across the world athletics community. I am confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by having him on board", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be a voice for athletes and I think I can really contribute to the direction of sport in Scotland".
The American, who won a total of four gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, is now a regular pundit on the BBC. However, he is unable to walk after suffering a 'transcendent ischemic attack'.
On Twitter, he wrote: "On this day a month ago I was suffering from a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether I will recover or to what extent.
It was a tough job, but I made a full recovery. I learned how to walk again.
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Pro-anti-breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows
Both online and offline have expressed opposition to the Breast Pump ad comparing mothers to cows.
Consumer tech company Elvie has released the world's first silently wearable breast pump, along with a hilarious music video showing how the new pump empowers mothers to express themselves.
This video features four mothers dancing in a straw shed: Yes, my milkman says, "But you can't see any tail. If you think these are the cows, you're wrong. These are my breasts".
The lyrics continue: "Pump, pump, pump, I'll give the milk to the children... pump, pump, pump, call for the milk of the mother".
The ad on the company's Facebook page has sparked a lot of controversy online.
The video has already been viewed by 77,000 people and has hundreds of comments. Viewers have given mixed reactions, saying it has taken the "terrible" dairy industry for a joke.
"It is a shame that the cow was used in this breast pump ad.
Like us, cows are pregnant, they give milk, but their calves are stolen as they are born".

Another said: "I know it's hard on both mother and child.
But why not use this breast pump for the advertisement of those who keep their children?"
Another said: "It's nothing but a headless advertisement".
Inaro defended the ad, with one woman responding that the song was "funny".
"It's a common idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have bought one of these.
It is true that there is a feeling of thirst during pumping.
Advertising may sound a bit crazy, but it's also a bit true.
Inaro wrote that this is a product of genius.
Another comment: "It's making fun of mothers who feel like they're really cows when they pump (in workplaces and toilets)".
This is not an ad that praises or disparages the dairy industry".
Finally, the commercials show dancers wearing breast pumps inside their bras.
The principle behind the campaign is an insight that many mothers who use a breast pump think they are bitches.
The LV pump, however, works completely silently. It has no valves or tubes. It fits snugly into the breastfeeding bra.
Anna Balerin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: "LV Pump is a revolutionary product.
We wanted to talk about breast pumping and its challenges by showing the equality between women who express themselves and dairy cows, and by telling it in a fun and relatable way, we wanted to show how a new pump can make you feel independent.
This is not the first time that Elvey Pump has appeared in headlines.
Two children were catwalked using a product for designer Marta Jakuboski during London Fashion Week.
Hundreds of children quietly migrated to a tent camp on the Texas border
The Trump administration's strict administrative measures have made it difficult to provide guardians for refugee children, leading to a sharp increase in the number of children detained at border crossings, even though the number has remained the same over the months.
Traditionally, those who want to adopt such children are themselves refugees, and when their lives are in turmoil, the desire to adopt such children makes their existence in the country even more turbulent.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities said that individuals or families wishing to adopt children must provide fingerprints, which are then provided to immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that his agency had arrested dozens of people who had taken in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal background.
"Around 80 per cent of the individuals are either sponsors or sponsors' family members who are staying here illegally and most of them have a criminal background.
So we are trying to catch these people", said Albenz.
In an effort to speed up the process, authorities have introduced new rules that require children to appear before a court within one month of being detained.
Most of these do not have to appear in person, but instead present their legal status by video call, which is heard by an immigration judge.
Those not eligible for exemption will be deported immediately.
Children who are in custody for long periods of time may become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent emotions and a tendency to escape. Shelter workers have observed and reported this.
Advocates say that such opportunities are more likely in large facilities such as Tornillo, which are too small to care for children in need.
The tent workers feel that moving the children to the tent city without any time to prepare them emotionally and without even allowing them to say goodbye to their friends will only add to their pain.
Syria calls for troops from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem urged Syrian refugees to return home as the Syrian war entered its eighth year.
Deputy Prime Minister Moallem said that foreign forces are illegally entrenched on Syrian soil and fighting terrorism is their pretext. He also warned that action will be taken against these forces.
"They should come out immediately and unconditionally", he said during the plenary session.
According to Mauleem, Syria's "war on terror is almost over". Since 2011, 360,000 people have been killed in the war and more than a million have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue its fight until it gets its hands on Syrian territory, and would fight against terrorism and illegal foreign forces.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training Kurdish and other Arab forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Mauleem said that the time is ripe for them to return home.He said that some Western countries are creating unnecessary fear and hindering the return of refugees.
"We appeal to the international community and human rights organizations to allow such repatriations", he said.
"They are actually doing politics on a matter that concerns humanity".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any assistance to Syria's reconstruction unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
The UN ambassadors expressed hope that the talks between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, would create a favorable environment for the start of political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided the possibility of an attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the state, which is home to millions of people.
There is a "clear timeframe" for the deal, and Maullem said that the Syrian offensive would be directed against all jihadist groups, including the al-Qaeda-backed Nusra Front, and that they would be completely destroyed.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is hopeful of forming a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution in Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mauleem also mentioned the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that there is no interference and that the purpose of the constitution drafting committee should be limited to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution.
Trump will be president again, how?
If Trump doesn't lose the presidency through a smear campaign or a scandal, he will be president again in 2020 - contrary to the optimism of most liberals.
So this is going to be 'the most dramatic presidential contest ever!'
There is no basis for spectators to complain about it at this time.
CNN's prime-time ratings have doubled since 2014 to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's ratings have tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime time viewers, according to Nielsen, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" was the top show with 3.5 million viewers.
"It's a crowd-pleaser. We don't understand what it is", says Neil Baer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor". In this drama, an attack destroys the Capitol.
Neal Scaval, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" and a veteran humor writer, says otherwise.
He also recalled a cab ride before the 2016 Boston elections.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" asked Nell.
They said, "They laugh at me", "Miss Scovell told me.
There is an entertainment in these distractions.
Of course, more than anything else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, or the global economy can be improved.
Change is the wish of the most privileged.
But the "deep background" of Bob Woodward's book Fear is that it's a resource. Watching experts on TV discuss Paul Manafort's $15,000 dollar ostrich leather jacket (the Washington Post called it Garment Think With Hubris)... watching star Daniels's description of Trump's impact on the world - that's not enough information for us.
I can't even see Super Mario in the same way.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of 'Powne Stars' creator Wheelhouse Entertainment, said that there is a sense of a reality show every night. Trump is feeding the debate. Whether it is a conflict with the NFL or praising Kim Jong Un, there are plenty of twists in the story.
They feel that even if they miss one episode, they will be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was taken inside while watching MSNBC on CNN.
The future of Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court could be balanced against him facing the Senate Judiciary Committee, rather than himself.
"I remember we were doing all those great shows and people said to me, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'

Tight midterm election house races are spilling money out
It's no surprise to see Pennsylvania's 17th money flood, thanks to the rearrangement of congressional districts that has landed two contenders in the same seat.
This recently reconstituted suburban Pittsburgh district is the pits of Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb - who last won his seat in another district in a special election.
Lamb is currently running against another seat, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were recreated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered in favor of Republicans.
The new 17th contest touched off a campaign finance slug fest between the main party's financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb gained prominence in Pennsylvania after being widely watched in a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been contested by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats some heat.
The U.S. was fined for supporting El Salvador, then supported China
Diplomats noted that Beijing, now in Washington, identified with the Dominican Republic and Panama.
Mr. Trump had an intimate meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization's management team.
"The State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over their decisions to recognize Taiwan in the future", Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalty was only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, a step in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But by mid-September, they made it clear that the conference of top executive officials would continue, effectively ending any consideration of a fine to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now addressing a conference scheduled for mid-October, the diplomat said, as a sign of the administration's importing of places.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, as described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
His accounts were confirmed by outside analysts close to the administration and he also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study history is
The next target may be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of justice, which now has enough evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller reportedly changed his investigation to see if Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
As Mr. Trump prepares to go before the electorate again, Congress must change hands and finally his friends' verdict is final.
It was a lot of things, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable or that there is no equivalent of him in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect how long the fight can last.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to stage a revolt against Hitler, only the Westerners opposed them and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the chance to avoid a subsequent genocide.
The course of history revolves around such reflection points and the inevitability of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several of these conspiracy elements.
What do we need to do if Mr. Trump is going to take on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the future of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Last year, Rosenstein became a federal judge after this paper reported that he had ordered the president to be secretly impeached and that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times account is not correct.
"How do we respond to the newly requested F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh's investigation was not complete or legitimate or he was confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and disingenuous evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the middle for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail such tests, democracy will be in chaos for a long time.
But I hope that we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied my embassy.
She survived, then immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
Like my heritage, can't I be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger Graham Dorrance was optimistic before the Rapid Vienna collision
Rangers' victory against hosts Rapid Vienna, the Austrians, on Thursday, puts them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League, after an impressive win against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance was prevented by a knee injury from making his first 2-2 draw with Villarreal but believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for more.
"It's a happy thing for us because Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
We might have won it in the end, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were a better team.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it's a tough game and they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can go on and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly tough, but between my injuries and everything that happened with the club changes, there is now an emotional element about the place.
The team is great and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is great.
Hopefully, we can now come back, we may have beaten ourselves last season and now we have a chance too".
Women are losing sleep over the fear of saving during retirement
Even though the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of themselves, few people talked to their family members about it.
He said that half of the individuals in the nationwide study are talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them but they are not taking steps to engage in the conversation", said Holly Sinder, vice president of life insurance business nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not convey your congratulations ahead of time, you will not be able to prepare your family.
Talk with your counselors and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as such choices can play a major role in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you suggest ways to pay for such expenses.
Your long-term care options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy, or a self-insurance policy to help you with these expenses as long as you have money.
Get your legal documents out: Face legal battles in the PAS.
Get a health care proxy so you can assign a trusted person to know about your medical concerns and ensure that your professional follows up if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
If you are unable to make financial decisions and pay your bills, you may choose a trusted person.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
You can prepare yourself by putting those details in writing.
"It's not just a game of finance", Martin asks, "but who is the doctor?"
"What are medicines?
Who cares for the dog?
Put that one idea into practice".
A man with an air rifle fired several shots at Lifracombe
One man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home at night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Lifracombe, Devon, when he was shot, with blows to the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials describe the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "random act"
The injured man did not see the person who attacked him.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police appealed for witnesses.
The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
Due to damaged communications, relief authorities were unable to obtain any information from Dongola Regency in the northern sector of Palau, an area close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu since the disaster.
Some highlights about the island of Sulawesi and the Dongola:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a steep bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
The regency of Dongola extends for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, the administrative division at the bottom of the region, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic backbone of Central Sulawesi is fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also prominent in the region, but it is mostly specialized in the coastal area opposite Sulawesi, in Morowali.
According to the Indonesian Relief and Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongola have been hit by a number of tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died and hundreds of homes were destroyed in Dongola due to a tsunami.
A tsunami caused nine deaths in Western Dongola in 1996.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an earthquake zone, and is therefore always affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the top earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of North Sumatra, Indonesia, on Dec. 26, hit 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of that occurring in Aqaba.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Region.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, creating waves 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and injuring about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake once again hit the P.D. Jaya Regency, as people remember from the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami, and caused destruction and panic.
This time, no tsunami caused any damage, but more than 100 people have died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the northern part of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily disrupted thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Former Alaska Governor's eldest son, Trak Paulin, and vice presidential candidate Sarah Paulin have been arrested on charges of assault.
A man named Pauline 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, who oppose interference and detention in domestic violence cases.
According to the police report, when the woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away from her.
Pauline is being remanded to the Mat-Su pretrial facility and placed in a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "definitely, not guilty" when his appeal was heard, the network reported.
Paulin faces three Class A felony counts, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, sentenced to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This was not the first time that criminal charges were filed against Pauline.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Pali, was charged with assault.
Her mother, Sarah Pauline, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and being a drug addict in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior arose from his service in Iraq for PTSD.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people dead
An earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday killed 384 people.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communication networks have been disconnected with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors seeking the unusual death penalty for a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York have executed Syfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attacks that killed eight people -- a rare sentence for a federal crime that hasn't been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rented truck to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan.
To justify the execution, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent seeking the death penalty, filed in the Southern New District.
According to court records, both of these counts carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Siopov on a 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of murder with the aid of a gang, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and assault and destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required "considerable planning and pre-emptive preparation", with prosecutors describing the method used in Saipov as "brutal, cruel and fraudulent".
"Diego Enric Angelin, Nicolas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Méndez and Alejandro Damian Pagnuch were among the families and friends of the Safiullo Habibullahovic Saipov who suffered injury and loss.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last tried a death penalty case.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953 when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed after conspiring to run a church for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenberg and the other were executed by electric chair.
A resident of Saipaw, Uzbekistan, displayed a lack of compassion in days and months, according to court records.
He said he had a good feeling for what he did, the police said.
According to the indictment, Saipav told the authorities that he was inspired after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that an ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
22 He also pleaded not guilty to the count of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender representatives representing Sipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" with the outcome of the lawsuit.
"The decision to commute the death sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole will drag out everyone involved for a long time", Patton said.
The judge was asked by the Saipaw's team not to impose the death penalty in the past.
Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage today pledged to 'mobilize the people's army' during protests at the Tory conference.
For saying that he should take charge of negotiations with the EU, as suggested by Theresa May's MP - a former UKIP leader - the Euroskeptics said politicians should 'feel the heat'.
Peter Bone, Conservative backbencher (leader of the opposition) said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have already left if Farage had not been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Ms May faces is different. She highlighted the separate struggle being waged by those who want to stay in the city in the anti-Brexit movement.
The Prime Minister is struggling to track his Chequers compromise plan amid an onslaught of Brexiters, Remainers and Europeans.
The allies insisted that she would go ahead and make a deal with Brussels despite the heavy opposition - and forced the Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between her package and the 'disorder'.
Bonn said he wanted to 'check out' at the Live Means Live (BD means leave) rally in Solihull.
He suggested that Farage should be made a peer and be given the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels.
'If they had been in charge, we would have already left,' he said.
The Welling Borough MP said: 'I'm for Brexit but we have to check the chequers.'
He said: 'We did not fight happily in the world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay out of Brexit is completely false".
Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, telling reporters: 'My one small suggestion: listen to the people, Prime Minister.
'Checkers are not popular in the public sphere, the opposition parties don't vote for them, it is not popular in our party and even in our activist sphere, really these activists are fighting in the streets and electing us to be the first.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Mrs May, he said: 'Prime ministers keep their promises and keep their position.'
Faraj said that the politicians who are holding the rally should be 'hot-tempered' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between our people and our political class", he said.
'We are here today to make it clear that they are trying to betray Brexit and we will not let them do that.'
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to warm up our political class to the betrayal of Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the people of this country who gave us victory at Brexit and will never rest until we make our country an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remains marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
The group started this weekend after activists waved Tories against Brexit banners.
Labour peer Lord Adonis satirized the Conservatives over security issues he experienced on the party app as the conference opened.
'These people will tell us that they can have IT systems with Canada etc. etc. and they can have all the technology with Ireland, a frictionless border and a free border for free trade, etc.'
'This is a complete travesty.
There is nothing better than Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to make the 'hard decision' to run for president of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "make the tough decision to run for president" after the U.S. election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future actions at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Jeff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the center of speculation that she may defeat Trump in 2020.
The event at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting Trump has held with entities using the town hall format since taking office.
The people who attended the meeting asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes women in high places", Warren replied.
Sims murdered by LSU team - killer arrested
Police in La Baton Rouge announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of a man named Daitian Simpson 20 at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He had released a video of the shooting of the murder on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and eventually he died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247 Sports reported.
Wade stepped forward to save his friend and shot Simpson.
Simpson was questioned about the incident and admitted that he was the one in the room with the gun and that he shot Wade Sims.
Without any resistance, Simpson was arrested and taken into the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6-inch Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, including 10 starts, and averaged 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes the World Championship round after winning against Sebastian Vettel after team order
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a bigger role in the race.
From the pole, Botas got off to a great start and almost scored Hamilton no points as he defended his position in the first two turns and thus invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Wettell went to the pits first and let Hamilton run behind the group in traffic, which was crucial.
Mercedes then pitched a lap and Vettel came out back, but Hamilton went ahead with some wheel-to-wheel action that allowed the Ferrari driver to pass through the inside reluctantly after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He held onto his tyres for the majority of the race as he was able to finish the race quickly and push Kimi Räikkönen to fourth.
He finally got to the pits on lap 44, but couldn't pick up speed for the remaining eight laps as Rykonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did all the work in a weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a two", said Hamilton.
It's really bad sign language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feines Tane at a rally on Saturday, after Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh insisted that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing her of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that people had shown "selfishness and disgust and falsehood" about what was going on in the Senate.
"One of the things that has been happening in the Senate over the last few days and it's a beautiful thing is that when you see anger, what it feels like when you see people who are angry and mean and nasty and lying", he said.
"You see the release and the leakage and then they're like, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that".
What is the meaning of the word "remember"?
Diane Feinsten, have you been leaked?
Remember her answer ... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I was just...
I did not leak".
Well, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn't", he added, quoting a senator.
A letter explaining the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford was sent to Feynman in July, and it had been leaked earlier that September - but Feynman denied that the leak came from his office.
"I am not leaking Dr. Ford's allegations, I am not leaking her story", Feins told the panel, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked".
But his refusal did not seem to have caught on with the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday night: "What can I say, that's really bad slang.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst sign language I've ever seen".
Defending the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president accused Democrats of using the allegations for their own ends.
"He is determined to withdraw power by any means necessary.
You see all the selfishness, the ugliness in them, who they hurt, who they don't even care to drive to get power and control", the president said, Medianite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against the Bell Fast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for their Elite League defeat against Bell Fast Giants by winning the return match in Dundee on Saturday 5-3.
The Giants took the lead with two opening goals, thanks to the brilliant strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieuil.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney helped their team to even the Dwyane Giants lead.
Two Lucas Lundwald goals ensured the victory before Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee's goals.
It was Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season, as he came off the bench to beat Dundee 2-1 in a match at Bell Fast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal with a Kendall McFall assist at 3:35 in the fourth, with Beaulieu doubling the lead when David Rutherford Ford provided the assist four minutes later.
Sullivan brought his team into the fight at 13:10 in a tight opening period. Then Cooney closed the gap at 15:16. This was matched by Matt MacWard South.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead to the first break by scoring the night's second goal late in the first period.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard added another goal to the stage with a power play goal in 27:37 minutes.
Together with Cooney and Charles Corcoran, Nelson helped Dundee to take the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured the victory in the final period halfway through their team's fifth period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies after trying to rescue hundreds of people from an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now being hailed as a hero for sacrificing his life to help hundreds of passengers safely get off the ground.
More than 800 people died and about a dozen remain missing after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The city of Palu is in a state of shock, with many people still believed to be trapped under the rubble.
Even though his colleagues all ran away in fear, 21-year-old Antoine Gunawan Agung, who was shaken by the earthquake, did not leave the control tower of the Mutia's Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu Airport.
He was still in the tower waiting for the safe takeoff of Boutique Air Flight 6321, which was flying up from the runway at the time.
He jumped out of the tower, thinking it had collapsed.
And Eith died in Asphrath.
"His decision saved hundreds of lives", said Johannes Sirit, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, as reported by ABC News of Australia.
We arranged for a helicopter to bring him from Balikappan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter could reach us.
"It breaks our hearts to hear this news", he said.
Meanwhile, access to the towns of Dongola, Siggi and Baotong is limited, the country's disaster management agency said.
"Many bodies are still in the rubble, but many are unreachable and it is believed that the number is still rising", said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-metre waves have devastated the share and mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and relief items.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: "Ambulance bodies are coming in every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
John Gell Fund, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross rescue workers are rushing to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already proven to be a disaster, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at the pavilion on Sunday and told the country's military: "I would like to ask you all to work day and night to complete every task related to the tax.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
More than 550 people were killed in an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, earlier this year.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after the Laguna plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean enveloped Micronesia has now officially said that one person is missing, who had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
As of Saturday afternoon, it was not possible to count the male passengers, Air New Guinea said in a statement.
The airline said that it is trying to locate the person with the help of local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the age or nationality of the passengers.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuk Island airport.
Seven people were hospitalized, officials said Friday.
Six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all are in stable condition, the airline said.
The cause of the accident and what happened is still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon area, just behind the runway.
Some witnesses said that the plane crossed the runway.
Bill Jans, an American passenger, said the plane was too low.
"That's very good", said Jans.
Jans said that he and others managed to run through waist-high water to find an emergency exit on a sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were scared and screaming, which caused a small head injury.
Sailors working nearby to improve the wharf, using an inflatable boat to push people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water, also rushed to the rescue, the Navy said.
The Aviation Safety Network figures indicate that 111 people have died in PNG registered airline accidents in the last two decades but none of the accidents involve the name of the airline.
Analyst says nighttime woman burned alive
The prosecution, which had been investigating a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014, reserved its argument on Saturday.
Forensic analyst Paul Rowlett, an expert witness in the field of U.S. intelligence analysis, testified for hours.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers (the victim) on the night Jessica died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones, which showed that Tallis was with Chambers on the evening of the murder, which he denied, The Clarion Ledger reported.
The accused claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, but the data shows that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, when police went to question Sanford.
Sanford had come to testify on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors heard Telles say he had slept in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford was lying, because my truck was in Nashville that night".
Another irony was that Telis Chambers had told me that he had only known me for about two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records indicate that they became acquainted with each other only a week ago.
After Chambers' death, Telles deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone, according to Roulet.
"He's erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense has decided to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The trial is expected to go to the jury later that day, the judge said.

Another black guy?!
A New York court has sued a couple who posted a message about "racial"
A New York nurse has filed a lawsuit against the couple, claiming that the message that was sent to her was "another black person" from a woman.
The couple denied the accusation that they were racist and compared the lawsuit to a "rape".
When new babysitter Giselle Morris arrived at her first day of work in 2016, two mothers named Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman were annoyed to learn that she was black.
"No, another black guy", Mrs. Plasco-Fluxman sent a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maris twice.
After realizing his embarrassing mistake, the "shame-stricken" Placebo-Flaxman fired Morris, accusing the nurse, who was African-American, of doing a bad job and sent her home, and that she was expecting a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for racial harassment based on the message and also demanding $350 a day for six months, without a contract, from the live-in gig she was initially hired to do.
"I want to show it, look, you don't do that kind of thing", he told the Post on Friday, "I know it's racial discrimination".
By claiming that firing Maris from her job was a reasonable thing to do, the couple are committed to the statement that she is racist, accusing her of having insulted her and that they cannot trust her.
"My wife sent me a message that I was not supposed to tell her.
She is not a racist.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post that they were not racists.
"But would you hand your children over to a woman who would treat you like dirt?
What about your newborn?
Tell me about it".
Describing the lawsuit as a case to "get over", Plasco said his wife was only two months away from giving birth and "she's in a very difficult situation".
"Do you trust such men and follow them?
It's not such a good job", said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still in court, the court of public opinion is at the forefront of condemning the couple on social media, with an increasing number blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared it would be difficult to accept the idea of a talking bear, a new letter said.
Bond's daughter, Karen Junkel, who was born after the book's release, said in her letter: "It is very difficult to play someone else, even before this book was printed, reading it for the first time.
It is truly amazing to think about the secret behind the incredible success of Paddington".
Talking about her father, she said that he was a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a bear toy and wrote a children's book. He kept his faith in his work even when his book was rejected.
Apart from Paddington, she also considers Paddington "like a member of our house of honour", she says of its phenomenal success.
"He was the least talkative of the men who never spoke", she added. "He never boasted about his accomplishments".
"But Paddington was a real person to him. It's like what it would be like if you had a successful child in front of you, like: you're not proud of what you've done, either.
I think he saw the success of Paddington as that.
Even if it was his creation and conception, he would give the full credit to the Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where all the doctors' efforts to save her life were in vain.
"Nad was calling repeatedly. It was really serious, to say, and she didn't expect to receive that call", said Mrs. Ednan-Lapperhouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I will join you soon.
I'll stay with you.
The medication the doctor had given her to pump her heart slowly fell out of place and she died.
She had died a short time before and the body was neutralized.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all pre-ordained.
I was surrounded by my family members and others, so I couldn't shout or scream or cry.
I had to really hold it together".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Lapper House, now grieving the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - forgetting the ordeal she was experiencing.
"No one knows", she replied.
"I kept my head down, and I would cry the whole way.
It's hard to describe, but it's in flight that I expressed this indescribable compassion for Nad.
He needs my guidance and love.
I know how much he loved her".
Posters of a woman grieving to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Two women, Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, are posting inspirational messages on Welsh Bridge, as well as giving out a phone number for anyone who needs help or comfort.
When Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old, he began to suffer from depression. When he was about 18, he committed suicide.
"I wish that no parent should have to suffer the pain that I suffer every day", he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious sense of humour.
"Everyone was overwhelmed by his laughter.
His smile would brighten any room".
He too had to give up his work before his death. He thus "was truly in the place of darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was only 11 years old at the time, took his own life, and he became the brother he had found.
"I was always worried that something bad would happen", said Mrs. David.
Mrs. David created the cards because "even in the midst of grief, there are people to talk to, people to share your pain with, and a friend.
Don't sit alone and be silent - you need to speak now".
Mrs. Humphreys, Davis' girlfriend for many years, lost her life partner of 15 years, Mark, after his mother died.
"He never told me that he was depressed or sad", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in Chris' behavior.
He was in the room on Christmas Day - when the children opened their Christmas gift box, he didn't even look at them".
She said that his death was an irreparable shock, but they tried to get over it: "It left a big scar in their family.
It separated us.
But we accepted it and fought".
If you are experiencing sadness or depression, please call 116 123 (UK and Ireland) or email jo@samaritans.org.
The FBI is continuing its investigation, and Brett Kavanaugh's future is in doubt.
"I think we'll get a little bit of whatever he's asking for - the time of investigation, the scope is very limited. We can bring some unity", Mr. Flake said.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican friends want an FBI investigation?
Their hesitation is because of the present times.
With the midterm elections on November 6th, which are just five weeks away - as expected, Republicans will not get the results right. They will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they want to the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush called senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House, and through him we met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
I still don't understand. Mr. Kavanaugh needs at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, so who let Mike Pence, the vice president, end the tie and tell the Supreme Court?
The number of North Korean defectors 'shrunk' under Kim's regime
A South Korean lawmaker believes that the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
South Korean Minister of Integration Park Byung-seog also provided supporting figures. According to him, 2,706 people fled in 2011, compared with 1,127 the previous year.
According to Park, this is due to the tight border zone between North Korea and China and the double fees charged for human trafficking.
Pang Yong has not made any official statement on the matter.
Most of the people who have fled from North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that some 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the 1953 Korean War.
Most people have fled the country through the Chinese border, which shares a long border with their country, rather than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats those who have fled as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and in most cases they are returned to North Korea.
North and South Korea are still technically at war, but relations between the two have improved in recent months.
The leaders met in Pyongyang earlier this month and discussed disarmament.
The development came after a historic meeting with Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, in which the two spoke about how to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho condemned the US's contribution to development.
"Without the confidence of the United States, we cannot unilaterally disarm our national security", Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh "mad", and thus unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "insane" and expressed the opinion that he is temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that when a woman ever acts like that, they call her 'crazy,'" Pelosi said Thursday in response to Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
He denied the allegation that the abuse occurred when both Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford were teenagers.
He openly denounced the Democrats on the committee, feeling that the charges against him were a "murder of the vicar and organized characters" organized by liberals. He expressed outrage that this is why Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her belief that Cavanagh's testimony proved the opinion that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it pointed out that he was biased against Democrats.
"With those statements and his comments about Clinton and the Democrats, I think he disqualifies himself", he said.
Pelosi was disappointed when asked if she would try to impeach if Cavanagh was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he hadn't told the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only would he have been in the Supreme Court, he wouldn't be in the court right now", Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the Affordable Care Act or the rulings of Kavanaugh against Roy V. Wade, because she considered Kavanaugh a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Cavanagh did not answer questions about whether he would revoke some of the rulings he had made in the Supreme Courts.
"This is not the time to expect a person with a bigoted and biased attitude to go to court and say, 'That's not cool,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It was the anger of a righteous person, and even after months and years, the anger comes out, and she can't get it out without crying.
"When we're angry, we cry", Steinem, 45, told me later that year.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
She continued, "One of the female officers helped me a lot, she also said that she cries when she is angry, but she developed a technique, which meant that when she became angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "I'm crying because I'm sad, you can think that.
I'm really angry".
Then she would go on.
And I thought it was amazing".
Tears have been considered a way to vent anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
My first memories of the job were in a male-dominated office, where I was crying with an inexplicable rage, when an elderly woman grabbed my neck belt and pulled me down. It was a little scary to see who was pulling me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know if you're angry.
They may think you are sad and they may rejoice in your sadness".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential contests.
In 1987, when she was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Hart Monkey Business and walked away from this embarrassment, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed, thus finding that she had no reason to withdraw from the presidential race.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign had already started too late, and she had been late in collecting the donation, having pledged to raise $2 million, and said she would withdraw from the contest if she did not do so.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that some of her supporters had given $1,000 to men and only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech announcing that she would not launch a campaign, she came out of her emotions - thanking the people who had supported her, finding it very difficult to raise money and reaching the goal. Expressing her frustration with the system.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", recalled Ms. Schroeder, describing how the press reacted to her.
"You thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what they would write on my tombstone.
"She is a witch"?""
How the US-China trade war has done Beijing good
Experts have expressed the opinion that the trade war between the US and China is not going to be a thing of the past, and while war is far off, the rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump first sent a warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important development is that this week's imposition of tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods will be affected, with half of all goods coming to the US from China effectively taxed.
Beijing has also retaliated on each occasion, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to join the US, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to be much smaller anytime soon.
To push back on Washington means to fall prey to demands, but to bow to America in public is very embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game properly, the pressure of the US trade war will positively support China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Experts believe that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would shake both economies, and that this is more dangerous than previously agreed", said Abigail Grace, a co-researcher on Asian affairs at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syrian 'ready', foreign minister says refugees to return
The government, which is determined to rebuild the country after seven years of protracted war, has asked the refugees to voluntarily return to the country to help.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said that the situation in the country is now improving.
"Today, the situation is very stable and secure. I thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The Government will continue to work to bring back the normalcy of the areas ravaged by terrorism.
It is time for those who have left the country for their lives and livestock due to the effects of terrorism and one-sided economic policies to return voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that about 5.5 million people fled Syria in 2011.
Six million more people live in this country and they need our humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian government welcomes those who help rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not accept aid from countries that had helped his country's coup or provided conditional aid.
Europe's team to win the Paris-Ryder Cup
Team Europe defeated Team USA by 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France to win the 2018 Ryder Cup.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish-born captain Thomas Jorn's team regained the European crown as they reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the USA team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, struggling without form for much of the tournament, submerged his tee-shot on the par-3 16th hole, which he lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, making him one of only 1 of 4 players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was eliminated in the 5th and 4th rounds by Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
World top-ranked player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who played perhaps his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia was named the all-time winner of European tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It has been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for trusting me.
I am very happy, very happy to have won the cup back.
"I am happy, I am happy to have contributed to the team's victory", said Garcia, who was emotional after winning the European Cup.
He handed the puck to fellow countryman John Ram, who beat US golfer Tiger Wood in the singles on Sunday 2 and 1.
"I'm really incredibly proud", said Rahm, 23. "I can't believe I beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him", said Rahm.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It's really strange that Tiger Woods has the most titles after Jack Nicklaus, 14 major titles.
The American team was very hungry this weekend, but only Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau played their best game of the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk, speaking after his team's disappointing performance, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought well.
This morning we got a bit hot for the Europe team.
But we ruined it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll be back, I'll be working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 players and am proud to serve as captain.
I salute you.
We played well".
Red Tide Update: Algae concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manate and Sarasota
Red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area are showing a general decline, according to a new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission.
According to FWC, pachydermal bloom conditions have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties - indicating that concentrations are decreasing.
When the Red Tide is strong, it stretches for about 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas in the north to Lee Counties in the south.
The impact of the Hillsborough landslide was felt along the coastline for 10 miles, but it was less than a week ago.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported in Pinellas County or its coastline in the past week, with a lowest concentration in Hillsborough County a short distance from the coast, a high concentration in Manatee County, a high concentration in Sarasota County or offshore, a low concentration in Lehigh County or offshore, and a low concentration in Collier County of eel eel or red tie.
Cases of respiratory irritation have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
No cases of respiratory distress were reported in northwest Florida last week.
