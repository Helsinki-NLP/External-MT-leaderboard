"Beautiful Munich" in 2018!
This afternoon, our candidates will be in for another surprise: they will not be competing alone in the romantic candlelight shoot before MY SOLARIS, but alongside male model Fabian!
- Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - not easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
But the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates are doing just fine shooting with People photographer Tuan, braving wind, rainstorms and rain like true professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB-Chief Grindel sees no basis for Ozil to return
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends on having a conversation with him, on having a conversation with him about why he felt the way he felt in his statement", Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months-long debate over Ozil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92 times national player Ozil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Ozil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case up to a certain point", Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had announced his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified this by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB-Chief reiterated his criticism of Özil, that he was not ready for a conversation with the German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to put pressure on him, but he knows from football that "when you leave a team or change clubs, you talk to your coach about it and I am sorry that this conversation has not happened so far".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergarten settlement burned down
At 2:13 pm, the professional fire brigade in Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in short supply.
The occupational fire brigade went out and found the hut on fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and the fire debris removed to the extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had a battery for the store at noon.
That could be the cause of the fire.
Anyway, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
It must have been considerable, however, for the owner had many collectibles in his garden shed.
Angry mother defends herself as Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on public street
What could have possibly driven Lindsay Lohan to this most bizarre action?
She was apparently trying to snatch the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has been streaming live, apparently trying to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Kissed for Luck" with Lindsay Lohan.
In the clip, Lohan is seen getting out of a car and walking to a possibly homeless family who she claims are Syrian refugees.
As the family flee the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of children against the dangers of exposure to ionizing radiation.
She doesn't provide any evidence of that in the video.
"The whole world is watching", Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from their parents.
Eventually, though, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
Looks like she's turning around and Lohan's gonna get a slap on the wrist.
The actress then tears as she confesses her shock - and keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It's supposed to get close enough to the Ryugu asteroid to suck material from its surface and bring it back to Earth.
The Mascot lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: death toll on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi has killed at least 420 people.
The death toll could rise even further.
Rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated and isolated areas.
Elon Musk is stepping down as Tesla's chairman
It started with a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused a stir in the stock market in early August when he announced the electric car maker's withdrawal from the market.
The SEC sued him for fraud, but now they've settled.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is stepping down from the board, but he's allowed to stay on as CEO.
The British Conservative Party
The Tory Party Convention - under heavy guard
Birmingham becomes the scene of a power struggle.
The four-day conference is expected to focus on foreign policy, trade and development, but it is overshadowed by a row between Prime Minister Theresa May and hard-line Brexiters, led by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum on the new name of the state
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed on a
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name-crosses for years.
Now they've come together.
The state of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia in future, and the people will vote on this Sunday - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" - meaning Jair Bolsonaro, who is not a member of the party.
A week before the presidential elections in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is the anti-system candidate and thus leads in the polls.
His most bitter rival is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: 'Dieselgate' is taking longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce is still in existence", said Peter Mertens, head of development, to the industry magazine Automobile Week.
The imprisoned and dismissed Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combination tests are expected to be completed", he said at the time.
Mr Mertens said: 'In early July, we reached an important milestone in the process of dealing with the diesel crisis.
We've completed internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was established in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" to ensure that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss it on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false emissions values after the emissions scams became known.
He either knew about the manipulation or deliberately ignored it.
Currently, sales manager Bram Schot is running the company as a temporary CEO.
The Commission has already decided to grant a loan of EUR 1 million to the German company Audi AG for the construction of a new plant in the city of Bremen.
In principle, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the Audi A6, A7 and A8 models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult", he said.
Schot is betting on electric mobility.
The e-tron, Audi's first electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm to the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the office of DFB president next year despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup-out and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can", said Grindel as a guest at the ZDF's "Actuelle Sportstudio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "strange", in his own words, if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the tender for the football European Championship in 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the Summer fairy-tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote is scheduled for the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB board, according to Grindel.
'I would be happy if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he could continue to consult in the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be invited to share his experience on sporting issues,' said Grindel.
He did not want to be involved in speculation about whether Lahm could succeed him as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
The current office holders are Cacau and Celia Sasic, both native Brazilians, the latter with family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says 'this issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration has to work", Grindel said.
Weighing correctly with half-smarter scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also measure muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index is calculated by the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about me replacing fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear starting lineup for Berlin and Oldenburg is
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has won a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball-Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game for over 40 minutes.
Neuzugang Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his debut in the national team.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory match debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the top scorer with 24 points.
The German team was led by Gabriel Olaseni, who scored 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Giesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings led the Oldenburg team with 25 points.
The Brunswickers, of which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the beginning of the season, were disappointed after a good first quarter.
The Baskets' one-run fast provided clear proportions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Mr Erdoğan had earlier met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gulen supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and damage German-Turkish friendship", he said.
The opening of the Ditib Mosque had partially closed down the city centre of Cologne.
Several thousand police were deployed, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized because it is considered an extension of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: stars, hoars and the second of horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have joined forces in a concert in New York's Central Park to promote greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Get involved wherever you can", Mendes told the festival on Sunday night to some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming. This is a dream.
Cardi B came out in a red outfit with fringes and a gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and relief agencies, also appeared on the stage during the hour-long spectacle.
But there was a moment of terror in between, when many onlookers mistook the sound of a tumbling metal barrier for gunfire, became frightened, and tried to escape.
In a moment, panic set in, people ran in a panic.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said event organizer Hugh Evans.
But the NYPD and musician Chris Martin then calmed the crowd from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anybody", said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival concert were free on the Internet, as they have been every year.
To gain access, they had to read and share online, photos and videos of the global fight against poverty and disease.
The crowd cheered and applauded the many musicians and actors, but the Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
But on Friday, Flake had come out in the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and that was a blow to the head of many women.
At least three women have filed charges of abuse and attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who claimed to have been sexually assaulted, confronted him in an elevator on their way to a parole hearing.
"You can also come with me in an elevator at any time", Flake told the crowd at the New York concert.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's expulsion from office
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a strong disturbance which is unacceptable.
He had security escorts escort the man out of the building.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Chancellery.
This applies irrespective of whether the concern is legitimate or not.
The rules are the rules.
Turkey has a lot of journalists in prison.
Many of them are accused of espionage, supporting or belonging to banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership holds the movement responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was only in early September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel have caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, the trials against the two are still ongoing in Turkey.
Florian David Fitz is drunk with Ina Müller
Fresh and handsome like his fans usually know him as, Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice to know that this is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfischposten".
The host, Ina Müller, offers her guests some beer, some wine or even high-profile drinks to lighten the mood and loosen the tongues.
Many celebrities are also encouraged to join the obligatory vocal group.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was taped.
This time, we're joined by actor Florian David Fitz, known for such films as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" and "The Hottest Day".
The Munich man didn't take the trip to the far north well.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed, his eyes are only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely wasted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a mighty hangover.
He posted some - perhaps not entirely serious - insights he has now gained to his fans: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas's.
Rule number two, never drink the black sauce.
And a needle.
And the round of eggnog that Ina throws at half past three, you'll have to leave out.
The 43-year-old's drinking is clearly on his face.
His fans posted some tips on how to combat the aftermath.
They were filled with instant soup, fish sticks, or -- probably most effective -- headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking is not yet known.
But since she has been hosting TV entertainment at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and unrat.
The entrance to the 36 km long cycle path in the Red-Cape region in Treysa is difficult to find and is very crowded.
Recipes for the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly in sight.
The first stage of the cycle path on the Haasse hill in Treysa has been presented by Längerem as broken pieces, cigarette butts, garbage and trash, demolished garbage cans and now dismantled signs.
For the model railway bicycle path in Rotkäppchenland, this is a more than shameful sight.
Members of the local ADFC Schwalmstadt group have been working on the subject for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised at the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the rule of the hour - regardless of any further activities", says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he also brought the issue to the local council.
It's not just the rubbish that's driving cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular place to party on weekends.
Not only is there often a lot of noise, but the shrines are also destroyed: posts are pulled out of the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are knocked over, seating is smeared.
Volunteers have been cleaning up more often, says Susanne Klippert, a member of the ADFC.
The actions, he said, were just the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They're upset that the bike path in Treysa is a drinking place.
"The entire cycle path is clearly the focus here on Haaße-Hügel", confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also looking after the new cycle park in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it'll be very expensive".
Another idea is to have video surveillance on the hill: "This could raise the threshold for seizing common property considerably.
That would require a police patrol to come by in good time.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants to develop the Haas Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The number of cyclists on the road so far is very satisfactory.
The tourist market is still in its infancy.
Our cycle route is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany", say the ADFC members.
The situation in Ascheröder Street in Treysa is considered to be a very critical danger point.
There's no turn sign on the Haass Hill.
"In busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two-way traffic", she explains.
The Commission has also decided to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the 'neutral' approach.
Music contest at the cultural station: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
The appeal of the Stadtteiloffensive Hiltrup is to present a song for the aid corps in the "music contest for young and experienced musicians, big and small".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together over coffee and cake by the volunteers of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations appeared, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time resident of Albachtener in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see as their bond?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the towns.
Rolf Ihmig cut the alley in his hit-song to the "Ko von Hiltrup".
The cultural railway station was also honoured.
Again and again, it was about the experience of being together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke enlivened the short pauses with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So Humberg was discovered to have studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke was able to report that the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has posted a lot of stuff on YouTube.
"It's not about winning", Franke had said.
In fact, all the participants received a gift from the Help Group's Gastronomy.
But there was something special about the jury's favorites - so that others could hear their songs.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all the children, they performed again at the finals - and sounded "really good", as Franke said, even without electronic support.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, the familiarity of the melody and the recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfalen School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Union, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The city's air offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event a complete success.
All were "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be-filled cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the spell check
The players form two teams, who sit opposite each other.
Each page has a viewing screen, and in it are four cards with keywords, which you can't decipher - the old trick with the red foil - until you put them in.
This ensures that the other party cannot read anything even by mistake.
The cards, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
The second window.
Third dice.
4th party".
These are the terms that must be encoded from now on.
Because it's not the terms we're trying to guess, it's the codes.
One player per team takes turns as the decoder.
He's gonna get a code card that might say "3.4.2".
The goal of Decrypto is not to guess the terms behind the secret foil, but to guess its encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "dice", "fix" and "window" - and in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the cryptographer writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to party; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible, and "Prag" because he has been careful in school and knows the local window crash.
Round by round, team by team, it goes on.
The terms of the other side are not known, but they can be better combined with any information given by the encoder.
So, the transcriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too weird, or you're making it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for a long time and thoroughly before they can finally play.
The explainer video on decrypto.info makes it easier.
But once you've gotten started, you'll be amazed at how much emotion is involved in this unobtrusive game.
But overall, "Decrypto" is not quite as coherent as its predecessor and genre-first "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're all about the guess and not the winning points, you can easily come up with a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harassed guests in the bar
A 48-year-old man occupied the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday exactly twice.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a police parade passing by in the Upper Town, then later he was also found in the Upper Town in a pub, when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly intoxicated and did not comply with the police's refusal to allow him to sit, he had to spend the night in the police inspection station Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In his sober state, he must then also be held criminally responsible for using the hallmarks of unconstitutional organizations.
The Pressig plant was home to the Schublok
The Pressig railway works was the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When one buffer was banging on another, it was heard all over Pressig", recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the town and the railway station.
It didn't bother anyone.
Then the brakes squeaked and the wagons squeaked.
That was a train.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's home press.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald has a place been so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters in height has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, formerly traction and draughting blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshops with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshops, conducting and railway conducting.
"The spinning wheel was a masterpiece, and after a rebuild in 1899 it had a diameter of 18 metres", says Norbert Heidrich, a railway historian from Hirschaid who worked on the railway for 47 years.
The Pressig railway works (BW) which was transferred to Bamberg in 1968 also operated locomotives for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and shuttle units.
From 1977 onwards, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10 000 wagons were still being graded per month.
Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that no consideration has been given to making better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport".
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld, the Nuremberg Railway Board held a pompous station party in Pressig on the day of Pentecost 1989.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here", remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later, it went out.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig railway station was history.
"The railway workers and the railway sweepers did the most difficult work on the trains", recalls Dinkel.
Any miscalculation would have been fatal.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with a first-place finish at the China Open
The European Parliament has voted to approve the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the European Parliament and Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs for human consumption.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next contender for the third place in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina when the Russian, who was seeded No. 13, gave up.
The Schwabe is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the context of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
The organisers and visitors were greatly relieved to see the special "Windspiel-Performance" opening in the open air of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate in Mittelehrenbach.
It is held under the umbrella of the Walberla Tourist Association as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 examples by 20 artists are now on display in Mittelehrenbach.
Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann, the owner of the house, welcomed the artists to the opening of the exhibition.
He's been with us since the first class.
So is Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as a principal organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have been active in the selection of artists and in the design of Flyer in the past.
This year, again, Kunst & Genuss has a special 70 cent stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
The poster for this year's "Betzn austanzen" (French for "Shopping in the City"), designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high level of interest in the special exhibition.
For the musical setting, Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was recruited.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear that the title "Windspiel-Performance" is a formal challenge to artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colored accents.
The "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, is already waiting for the visitor at the entrance of the estate on the right side.
It is a tree trunk, colorfully lit, playfully fitted with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes, and 24 cast-iron pipes as a sounding piece.
With the sun shining through the bush in the background, the object seems fairy-tale and invites us to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to write in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years of K&G.
It's a lot of moving parts in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the field, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy figure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "windspiel-performance" is introduced by strolling through the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition is open to visitors until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Autumn: singers celebrate their 50th birthday with a party
1968 was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albaceteans, too, were expressing their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They were not willing to accept the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sangesleben in the district.
It has become a legend: on a bench in the Tin Bush they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the water.
That was 50 years ago.
The anniversary was celebrated in a big way at the "House of Encounters".
"It will be full today", said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachten singers.
To celebrate the anniversary, they revived the foundation feast.
It was a tradition for years, then it was a pause.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was called for, for festive attire had been asked before.
Instead of sitting in rows, as was the custom in the "House of Gathering", the guests sat comfortably at tables.
In between, the movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It's a matter of honor that the singers of MGV 68 Albachten have voiced themselves.
Fittingly, joyful songs were sung.
I'd say, "Some day, as beautiful as today".
In line with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin term for "hop".
Once again, the chorus was conducted by Richard Homann, one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction", Holstiege said. "He has such a light way, it's a masterpiece he's doing".
The "Hohes C" ladies' choir was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
And then there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until 3 a.m. trying to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to pay for the children of the Albatross Youth Center to visit the Allwetter Zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins the high-class derby against BW Aasee
The lifeguard is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really well situated in League three.
No sign of fear or fright, the independents doing their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee really well.
"It was not a clear-cut decision, but we made an impression", says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied". On the contrary.
The mood was good at a subsequent birthday party for Ronja de Boer, the game was off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it to the finish line, a game like this can go wrong", says Büring, who has been in the business for many years.
Finally, USC, with its routine forces, made it all clear and brought the full bounty to the finish line.
"We all know who's on the other side in a derby like this.
It's not gonna break our necks.
I've seen some really good volleyball", Annacker did not hesitate with the 0:3 - and immediately went on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents is going, after just three days of play, seems unpredictable.
"It's just too early for that", says Axel Büring.
Only in one does he feel validated: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
Regional League volleyball is not even close". They don't want to look down on the fourth league anyway.
If the vest doesn't get dirty in the next few weeks, they'll have to look up.
But you can't draw a balance sheet until you've played ten or eleven games.
We're going to Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee is arriving in Essen on October 14.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dreamship", Heide Keller became a star.
Now she's openly talking about how the show may have had a hand in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the head stewardess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star may have been partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues whom I admired took me on at eye level", says Keller in an interview with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first, she was always just "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the only people the reporters would call are Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much".
She thinks it's possible that her husband at the time may have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans was shy about talking about problems and feelings".
I've always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That's what I meant by "I was pretending", she said.
She always felt like she wasn't good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman, which I was never, even though I sometimes appeared bold and daring on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever".
After a previous marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes once again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the wedding, I was crying in the dressing room, wanting to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why it never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller said that he imagined love at the time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not for everyday use.
I was too naive in my approach to love".
The night butterfly, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort in Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but it's a bit of a light-shy.
And the bright glow of a green carpet on the Sechseläuten square is blinding him beyond measure.
But it's a film festival, so there are celebrities who want to be in the spotlight.
So late Thursday night, he stumbled across the plaza to relieve himself in the Aquaclean WC Oasis.
The name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitation company, which is making its debut at the festival: The toilet on the ground floor of a new pavilion is working hard to create a luxurious ambience.
But tonight, for some reason, the men's oasis is smelling like heaven.
So out here, across the street, the invited guests who just entertained at the highest level in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" are celebrating the festival's opening with a party in the three-storey department store, as they do every year.
Its name is perfectly suited to this film festival: the works shown come from all over the globe .
What do you have to do to avoid being caught in the cross-promotion of the 190 partner companies of this festival?
The butterfly ties a little band around its proboscis, which a good fairy has put on it, and two bulky doormen actually generously wave it in.
Inside, the guests huddle, dancing late into the night to live music or to DJ rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and wash down with exquisite bites of cups.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters await mouths to be sipped, next door the incomparable ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bubbling.
And the thing is, all the store shelves full of exclusive products haven't been cleared for the occasion.
It's been going on for years, so it seems to be working without any major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Please wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he's gotten confused in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construct, and it's certainly saved lives.
In the home department upstairs, the bird is pouring a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", which is the festival's award.
The award for the best drink is not necessarily given to this mixture, which is presented by a capsule manufacturer.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that night either.
But there, between local celebrity, cash tables and kitchen utensils, a face passes by that is familiar to the onlooker: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor won't be far behind.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, almost sixty years old, almost like a choirboy, walks through the crowd.
He is not to be talked to, not to be beaten, but only to be heard.
It is precisely this restraint, often misunderstood as a nuisance, that has made international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with a Cumbia dance
Coach and former soccer star Diego Maradona is happy about his team's victory.
Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled into his new home in Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the booth, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-tier team had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called to a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: League One: ASV Sending after last-minute plate "destroyed to the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball-verbandsligisten ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "broken to the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had played well for many periods, the broadcasters, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst.
"We've been sleeping through the first phase", the coach said.
The hosts led 8-1, and the early break Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit.
"But then, all of a sudden, a jolt came over the team", Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
By the break, the deficit was only two more goals.
Especially the best of the show, Marius Hintze, met in the phase again and again.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was out at 15:15, after which the relay driver led almost completely.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still three goals (29:26).
What's next?
The impartial ones intervened.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But the 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff took was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought hard, they beat seven guys in the back and they kept throwing for goal.
They just can't buy the compliments.
"Now we must win", said the restless Bieletsky.
The first two are the following: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hooking up (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police are digging for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (County Court), the police are still searching for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, emergency workers dug up a road near Marxgrün.
The road was removed and several layers of the pavement were removed, police and prosecutors said.
New evidence suggests that the missing woman may have been buried not far from her former residence.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
The investigators didn't rule out a crime at the time either.
The Hof police have been working intensively with the prosecutor's office on the case since last year.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Landmarks Agency, the investigators came across a remarkable feature under the road at Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained to smell human bones, officials narrowed the area to a few yards.
The results of the excavations should be announced later this afternoon.
The hack of millions of Facebook users is a clear example of the dangers that lurk on the Internet.
However, users can also provide additional security themselves.
Instead of using complicated letter sequences, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates such as for Windows should be installed quickly, and it is also a good idea to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his threatened recall as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages, in which Musk could have lost his license to run a publicly traded company.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will relinquish the chairman's position for three years, a position comparable to the German supervisory board.
The CEO can stay.
In the settlement, which still needs to be approved by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the U.S. Federal Court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric-car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion.
Musk is not conscious of any guilt.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk tweeted to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company public, paying $420 per share, and that funding was secured.
That would have valued Tesla at $72 billion.
Musk later backed off, saying Tesla would stay on the stock exchange.
After the deal, Tesla now has to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team to the match against Chelsea
Liverpool FC came back to win against Chelsea FC.
In the top game at FC Chelsea, the attacker who had just been replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp in the 89th minute for the 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins to start, Liverpool dropped to second place.
Chelsea remain third, and the new top team is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard scored his sixth goal of the season to give Chelsea the lead in the 25th minute.
After that, the Klopp team missed the tie several times.
National team player Antonio Rüdiger cleared the line (31) after a solo by Liverpool's goalkeeper Mohamed Salah.
With the ball in play, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a corner kick.
Record-setting champions Manchester United are sliding deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United deservedly with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days of play only in the midfield of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after Petr Cech was injured.
The match was played at Hoffenheim on Tuesday, and Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0 and Ilkay Gündogan was not used for the new leader.
"Let's dance" judge Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has apparently separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert became famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Sunday newspaper) quotes Lambi's lawyer as saying that the well-known host and dance expert has separated.
"Our clients have parted amicably and amicably", lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser told BAMS.
Their two daughters' welfare is their first concern.
The couple reportedly met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his jury work on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment shows.
Arrested at Barcelona demonstration
- Barcelona Protests in Barcelona on Saturday clashed with police.

A total of six people were arrested.
Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, the GroKo is collecting several polling drops.
The SPD is falling behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Sunday picture for the first time in Germany.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU are also losing one point, and are now at 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union on the Sunday trend to date.
The Greens reach 15%, the Left 11% and the FDP 10%.
If the elections were held on Sunday, the governing parties, the SPD, CDU and CSU, would only get 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
The big coalition has now lost the majority in the Sunday question in all the big research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently receive between 43 and 45 per cent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent.
The other parties also have a wide range: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens are getting between 12.5 and 17 per cent of the vote.
The Left is at 10 percent, the FDP is at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of the vote.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the public think Merkel is the right person for the chancellorship, according to the Emnid poll commissioned by BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wishes the grand coalition to last until the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are in favor of a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday also showed a clear decline in Merkel's popularity.
The German people are also divided over whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
47 percent are in favor of it, 44 percent against it, according to Emnid.
Among those who support the Union, 64% want a candidate, 35% do not.
Aldi's poster: reduced price for love happiness
Aldi is going to Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in the age of Tinder there are no more romantic stories about getting to know each other should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In the age of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place to meet the great love is almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, that's right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts bargains at the barbecue table or the favorite pudding is doubtless still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less of a contact but more of a flirty exchange.
We've taken the test: how do women react when you don't talk about the hot pot for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
The real Hollywood love story potential is when the love story is preceded by a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then also contacts his beloved using the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and his consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is quite reasonable to hope that the author of this advertisement in an Aldi store that we do not know will find her dream husband, with whom she had a brief conversation about the "30% reduced organic veal".
For believing in the magic of analogue learning, she definitely deserves her Hollywood-style happy ending.
Billerbeck: 500 covers for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger school has been taking part in the campaign "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Deckels für ein Leben ohne Kinderlähmung".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by poliovirus.
The disease, called infantile paralysis in German, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease is endemic.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccination so far, according to a press release.
Reus and Zorc demand that Götze be allowed to rest
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate about the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us", said Reus, who was friends with Götze, after the 4-2 win in Leverkusen at TV station Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.
Eberl: No rush in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach is in no hurry to extend his contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even discussed a contract yet.
There's no fixed date when we're gonna do this.
"But there will certainly be a moment when we can sit down and talk", Eberl said on Sunday evening on Sky TV.
The club's first match against SC Altenrheine is a very exciting one.
There were moments in this young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own kind.
The coach of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck, he said, first (inwardly) withdrew to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
Meanwhile, the roundabout at Brandhoveweg is back on.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine is a good proof of this, having only missed the ascent by a hair on the previous season.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We've made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was a real show", Fetsch praised his boys and went to see each one after the game to say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had a lot more playing time in the first half.
And the odds.
But Frerichs, who was 17th, missed the lead, while Luca Rehberg, who was 26th, and Jan Schroer, who was 38th, were in the lead.
This almost came to pass when the SCA in the 41st minute twice in person Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously struck in front of the Wolbecker box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his craft.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 yards missed by a hair.
Schroer was also late to a Thewes re-entry after 58 minutes.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed another fresh cell treatment on the left side.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer knocked Robin Westhues out in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 metres from the guesthouse.
The Gefoulte himself came forward and demonstrated his dangerousness at Standards.
Westhues' thing with the right flap hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1: 0 (71).
20 minutes left, which should be a long fucking time.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute to the leather in the penalty area unfortunately to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) was quick to point out the point.
Jannis Schneider was not to be missed (79).
Wolbeck had to survive a few minutes in the final phase, before Geske had the winning goal in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe too much of a good thing would have been.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the Community's common fisheries policy.

Eintracht Frankfurt wins by 4 to 1 against Hannover 96
Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.
Forward Ante Rebic, who was in the starting lineup for the first time after an injury, was supposed to help.
The midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a groin injury and should prevent the SGE from scoring more goals according to standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
The plane crashed on the tarmac.
All four occupants were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, a tragedy occurred at the Kottingbrunn airfield.
Turbulence was reported during the landing of a helicopter, as confirmed by the police to oe24.
The helicopter was caught in a gust of wind, crashed to the ground, and came down on its side.
Police, rescue and fire services were immediately notified.
With a huge order, the emergency services arrived at the scene.
The emergency medical helicopter of the OAMTC was also called out for precaution.
Injured only slightly
Fortunately, it turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to walk home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident are still uncertain and are the subject of an investigation.
A small fire broke out, but it was quickly extinguished.
The Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
Only 8% of the board members were women at the end of September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented to the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to change their approach, otherwise international competitors will pass them by", said Wiebke Ankersen, the foundation's managing director.
In the USA, the UK and Sweden, with a few exceptions, male-only management teams are no longer possible.
The backwardness makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It's a different company culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German listed companies is also due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the medium-sized index (MDax).
However, according to Allbright, only 6.8% of the board members are women.
However, the figure was 3.8 percent in the previous year.
The proportion of women in the 30 Dax companies - which have been pioneers in recent years - stagnated.
The last time there were 26 women on the boards.
"I am sure that next year the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women - in their own interest", said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had indicated that they would not commit themselves to increasing the share from 'zero percent' to date.
The situation is different in the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women on the boards was 30.5% - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited annually to the board, the figure would reach 40 percent by 2023", says the report.
Some even make a mess: luxury cars: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
The best is Ferrari.
The Italians take 280,000 euros in profit for every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: That slogan still holds true today - in most cases.
Who among the Edel dealers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury car manufacturers make in revenue per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made an operating profit of €69,000 for each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only makes around €800, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of money on each car.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the European Union's automobile industry is not left behind in the market.

The torch relay to mark the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
The tourist association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the club organizes the wine festivals, which henceforth rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Street.
To kick off the anniversary, the officials marched through the town to the festival site, accompanied by the sound of the Spielmann Zug from Wiesenbronn.
The visitors were welcomed by the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, the mayor, Jürgen Schulz, and the wine princess, Lisa Kursawe.
This is something to be proud of", said Mr Starz to all those who helped.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically joined the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way to us after the downwind". Later, "Die Troglauer" set the mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was celebrated, the association had fixed the drinks prices in the afternoon as it had done 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, at the guest's home, before the second round begins a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes into taxi
An ambulance is parked next to a road with severe damage.
A 27-year-old female bystander was fatally injured when the emergency vehicle collided with a taxi.
When emergency medical personnel are called, they are to help - ideally to save lives.
Such a rescue operation ended in death for a 26-year-old woman in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision between a ambulance and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the paramedic and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance had run a red light with a blue light and a Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided with the taxi at a crossroads near the green.
The ambulance slammed into a traffic light and a tree after the collision.
He caught the passenger, who died at the scene.
The driver of the ambulance and the taxi driver were seriously injured.
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the ambulance driver were seriously injured and had to be rescued by emergency services.
The 29-year-old nurse, who was also badly injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian was unable to help her.
Another emergency physician tried to do so, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police are working closely with the Bonn prosecutor's office to determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After a shameful defeat in the League Cup, Manchester United now lose in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU is down 1 to 3 against West Ham United, and the manner of the defeat is still to be determined.
The scene in the 74th minute was symbolic, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly brought the Red Devils back into the game.
With the pass of Mark Nobel suspected of an offside, all the defenders of Manchester stopped, and let Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball to the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously long-standing under-performance.
The mood at United's city rivals Manchester City is very different.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's rival Pep Guardiola, came within a 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the first home team's outsider defense barrier.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool are no longer in the lead
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 draw with Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea.
As in the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the match until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came on in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Better than Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his schlenzer.
So, after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for a second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the League, the Blues Liverpool now also dropped from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
The Gunners fans, who had been impressed by Granit Xhaka's performance, had to wait until the 81st minute for a win against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckily sent Alex Iwobi into the own goal, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil scored the third goal of the season to make the decision.
Arsenal have overtaken Watford for the fifth time in a row and are now just behind rival Tottenham in fifth place.
The Wolves went 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and occupy the eighth place.
The VW brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the spirit of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show is held every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic, but omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not be allowed to go unchallenged by the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products in the French capital next week, along with competitors from around the world.
The diesel is not really a big part of the picture anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which will be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are likely to be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models with them, among others: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart in 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to launch until 2021.
The new number three is the center of attention in Paris.
This year, from 4 to 14 October, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented.
Motorcycle manufacturers, as well as many mobility services and software providers, are represented in their own halls.
The fair, which is celebrating its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well over a million people visited.
The severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami have claimed the lives of at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake was a 5.9 magnitude, the second a 7.4 magnitude.
The damage to communications and transportation has been extensive and the damage to property has been extensive.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami swept over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds gathered on the beach for a feast.
There are fears that the death toll will rise even further.
The numbers are only from Palu so far.
But there are many other communities affected along Sulawesi's west coast.
Some 150 bikers hold a service in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne, Germany, held a final service for the motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Church of Peace in Eveking was the property of the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the bikers' graduation service was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral interests of the PS-strong bicyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional Motorcycle Worship (MoGo) service takes place at the Nordhelle House on the last Sunday of each month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikers had gathered there for a very unusual service.
By 10 a.m., the police cars were lined up outside the church's entrance.
First, the biker breakfast was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek during the Biker Service.
The music was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues-rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetic-calm tones", says the pastor Frank Schröder.
Yesterday was certainly a new day in the history of motorcycle worship.
The home team of the club is having a big party: after the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was active on the day of the action.
She served her hungry guests freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He carried his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished audience the process of the ripe apple becoming apple juice, step by step.
Then, from time to time, Hartmann-Niemerg would hand the field to the children and have them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely ground mass.
Many of the children had no idea how to make a tasty drink out of it.
But they could also see this important step in the work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed into forms and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a bit like chopped porridge, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical assistance, the last step of the work was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually flowed into a large vessel.
But the farmer in the village had already filled some of the specials.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents talked while the children not only watched the apple pressing process but also discovered the bouncy castle.
The festival also included the participation of the Füchtorfer Kameradschaft der ehemaligen Soldaten (Comradeship of Ex-Soldiers of Füchtorf), who invited people to play games at some stations.
The home club will also be offering an action day next year.
In this case, however, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the action will not take place in the home village at the heart of the Savings Village.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also clear from the subject: milk will be the end of the matter.
4 to 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-plate: "Hellish situation"
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals and encouraged them.
However, there were not many positives in the 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out as a team", said 96-year-old football pro Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "It's disappointing, of course, because you always have a lot of work to do".
The lower Saxons, who were drawn further on, and who were only joined by Florent Muslija (86), are two points behind and are a relegation candidate in their current state.
On the other hand, Frankfurt, led by the superior Ante Rebic, celebrated the first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB-Pokal winner, who after the successful general test for the Europa League game against Lazio Rom with seven points advanced to the midfield of the table.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of Hesse in his starting fifteen and could never get a grip on Hannover's defense.
The long-beaten striker after the World Cup showed with his pace and determination why he is so valuable for the unity.
Along with Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned from FC Liverpool, was in the starting line-up for the first time, which started strong.
A head-ball from Lucas Torró (17) hit the net was the first to pose a threat.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position in the last moment by the 96 defense by the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term out Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the house owners fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic took the ball into the penalty area after a corner, Haller extended head-first into the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
The goal was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came from second-tier French club AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still in the lead before the break.
This time Haller passed on his partner Rebic, who skillfully filled and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the second half, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons now played a little bolder forward, but the ideas remained until the end, when at least the final goal was still possible.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After almost an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put across on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show run for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, even Jovic hit a minute before the end.
Morlaix Place is turning into a party mile .
Despite the cool temperatures, the Oktoberfest in the city center was a good mood.
Munich's Mayor Dieter Reiter made it in front of a million people at the opening of the 185th.
Munich's Wies'n with two strokes last week.
Geisingen: Christians from Geisinge celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross
The Catholics of Geisinger celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The festival service takes place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, which dates from the Thirty Years' War and which according to legend was shot by a Swedish soldier.
The gunshot wound then started to bleed.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still unfinished today, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite its importance to the parish of Geisinger, the service was not well attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended with the final blessing.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has invited the secular part of the celebration to the Catholic parsonage.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty meals, a wide variety of cakes, and farm ice adapted to the weather.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours of the church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the pending construction measures that will continue until next year.
The structure has been in place for some time, so that the damage can be more precisely identified and the individual tenders can be more specifically prepared.
It is certain that the renovation will cost more than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become larger, but more have also been identified, which was made possible only by the opening inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base-plaster work is completed, the natural stone work is to be started before winter and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Opening of the new residential building in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Life Support Foundation is opening a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstrasse.
That a "very special house" is now being handed over to its intended purpose in the Münsterblickstrasse - all those present agreed on this at the inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Donau-Iller assisted living centre for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
The architect Rudolf Bader has considered wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access to all areas in his design.
The initial planning began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officers' building was put on the test for residents with Handycap: "The house had aged and was out of date in its furnishings", Bader said in retrospect.
In 2016, the diggers moved in to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable, according to the architect.
Donau-Iller is opening a new home
The new building cost the life support about 4.6 million euros.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
The construction work has been carried out within the planned framework, according to architect Bader, both in terms of time and money.
Jürgen Heinz, the managing director of Lebenshilfe, also thanked him for this.
The balance between an accessible and a fireproof construction was not always easy.
Yet, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many features that would allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move around without outside help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need aids to be mobile".
The combination of living and working was a good one, said Kreutmayer.
And then, "The property in this situation is a real luck, because it is no longer possible to acquire in the current situation".
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstrasse offers space for 30 disabled people in three housing groups on an area of almost 1500 square metres.
Heinz, the director of Lifelong Learning, is proud of the 11 full-time workers, all of whom are employed on a fixed-rate basis.
Germany: Sessig complains about East-West differences
- Before the Berlin Day of Unity, the SPD deputy leader Manuela Schwesig appealed to all her countrymen not to accept the discrimination against East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences", the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but received 15 per cent less pay.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German reunification", said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this clean dog end the Korean conflict?
The year-old Pungsan Hound is meant to smooth the rifts between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease tensions with Seoul, Pyongyang has gifted South Korean President Moon Jae In with two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They then passed through the border town of Panmunjom with three kilos of dog food to help the animals "ease into the environment".
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears, and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are a national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North's friendship gift was announced at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to jointly participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly bid for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri missile propulsion test facility.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
The 100th anniversary of the Republic, which is now nearly ten months into this year, has seen the publication of a number of new books which answer this question, usually in the light of the past hundred years.
In contrast, historian Wolfgang Maderthaner, director general of the Austrian State Archives, has a different view in his magnificent "Picture Book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to business - that's the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's work week starting today.
I am not sure that the Commission is prepared to accept the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, but I am sure that the Commission will be prepared to accept the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask the legitimate question, what is the difference between work and manual labour, but that is all.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its task of governing, it should not be held back by a debate on the terms of the Treaty.
The Union and the SPD can still achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the past few weeks, perhaps as early as Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to call this round regularly now to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the dispute.
The first is that the diesel retrofits and the skilled immigration law are once again a contentious issue.
The CSU transport minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, while the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesels.
The EU and the SPD are still far apart on the proposed legislation on the immigration of skilled workers.
The SPD is calling for a prospect of staying for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is firmly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another fight between the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
The Group was not formed by the combination of the same partners, but by three partners with very different social views and priorities.
Fighting is good.
A society with so many diverse and sometimes conflicting interests cannot progress without conflict.
But in order to be constructive, the debate must not be turned into a question of being or not being for party tactical reasons.
This is still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight, but always keeping in mind the realities of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
This guiding principle will help to resolve the diesel and the change of track problems in a pragmatic way and thus to regain confidence.
That is the main reason why the people's parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the crosshairs
Does the Minister of Labour violate the law on the service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
The Commission's proposals are not only a step in the right direction but also a step in the wrong direction.
The Commission has also been asked to examine the possibility of a new directive on the protection of the environment and the environment against pollution from the production of certain substances.
It is assumed that "the Minister was merely expressing her enthusiasm for the work of her team and in no way was she announcing breaches of the rules of the service in front of the cameras".
The Commission has now asked questions to clear Hartinger of any suspicion.
Police tear up a street looking for women's bodies
The police would not comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, digging is taking place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
The investigation had previously been led by an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained to detect the smell of old human bones, was able to narrow down the relevant area to just a few metres, in cooperation with his handler, on several occasions.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Supreme Landmark Protection Authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the road section.
For more than a year, the prosecutor's office and the Hof Criminal Police have been working on the case of the missing person.
A cycle path was closed and examined with sonar equipment because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been blocked here during the construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Paint and eggs: rioting in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia's anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But before that, there's a riot.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who participated in the illegal referendum last year with a rally.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting was accompanied by violence.
Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also left the country.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
The new Catalan government took office in May and the compulsory administration was ended.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
The European Union has already taken a number of measures to combat the illegal trade in tobacco products.
Red-White Ailans continue to move in.
The result was a 0-0 draw at the Gütersloh.
The final light and the third last revealed them to 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium as a collective bewilderment.
The first half was a little too much fun.
So if you wanted to grab a beer or a hot dog, you could do so without worrying.
There was no danger of missing a chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
The first goal of the match was scored by Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - opportunity the Ahlens had was when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters just over the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it went smoothly.
The quick-playing counter over Sinan Aygün was "crowned" by Nick Flock (62.) with an albeit coy shot in the arm of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also put a head ball from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, bringing first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.). He was replaced by Marko Onucka for the final two games of the season.
It worked - nothing.
The Chosen achieved nothing more than visual superiority through their own initiative.
It was in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had his last chance, but it didn't bring any profit either.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent did not want to play here", stated RW Ahlens's interim trainer.
Offensively, "it was a little bit of a slap in the face" against a team "that was just trying to defend.
I didn't feel we could get a counter-goal", said Daut.
Unfortunately for him, the spectators did not feel that his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
The crop farmers' market in Reckenfelder: there are enough
This is the pleasure of Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler of the Reckenfelder Tafela distribution center, to whom these donations are destined.
The volunteers assure us that these donations will remain in Reckenfeld.
The opening was bright blue, and the space was still somewhat empty, but that was to change as the day went on.
"It's so nice to be here, that's why we're here today", said one visitor.
The organizer of the party, Franz Josef Holthaus, welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a decent sense of humor.
The Brockmanns, who were supposed to be weighed against food, were replaced by Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer.
Verena (Ferdi Kreimer's daughter) has been taken ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" was always busy entertaining the growing number of visitors with music.
The response was so good that some folk songs were sung later.
"It was just great", said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased to see many active people with their stalls, including mainly clubs.
"There really shouldn't be such a thing as a blackboard", he said, thanking the men's choir for their action.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
Our garden city is getting a little more colorful.
Then the micron was removed from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück by the fire department and taken to the Winter Quarters.
Many stalls were used for physical work.
From sweet to savoury, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, has been getting creative with his cutting saw.
He had a lot of things on offer, like veneer work, beer lids with raked patterns, and a lot more.
The specialties of the three Reckenfelder bee-keepers were "Reckenfelder Honey" brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a special feature.
Honey cake in a glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to reach for it again and again, because the cake was so good.
The company is what kept the visitors long into the evening, even without the stage program that is not available at the Autumn Festival.
The local political message is not a good one: Skate-setting is not a successful promotion
In Lengerich, Unknown has been lobbying in a way that is not very helpful for the construction of a skate park.
The Commission has already taken action in this area, and it is not the Commission's intention to take action in this area.
In at least one case, the police have been called in on charges of damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" were written on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among other places.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding inscription was discovered on the advertising sign at the entrance to the Gempt bistro.
Since the brief message was apparently left "only" with an Edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it was back, but this time it was sprayed", says Rottmann.
He considers that the appropriate advertising sign should be replaced.
The fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board gives this case a special note.
If the skate park is built, it should be made possible by sponsors.
The Commission's proposal is to make the European Union's financial contribution to the European Union's budget more flexible and flexible.
It is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies on the blacklist.
For years, the issue of skating has been a topic of local politics and administration.
After the old one at the LWL clinic had been demolished, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted overwhelmingly in favour of the fire station parking lot.
However, this was not done - too many factors seemed to be against building on this site.
A reversal took place in late June.
The members of the principal and finance committees now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg school grounds.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is for the city council.
He's assuming a decision this year, so if a positive vote, we could build in 2019.
Air traffic control bottlenecks worsen
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos of the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come", said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, to the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'competent authority' in the case of a public authority.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years", said the union official.
The market for trained pilots is being wiped clean across Europe.
In the Karlsruhe center alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
The Commission has also been asked to take action to ensure that the EU's air traffic control system is fully operational.
In the Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, it will not work without us", said the head of the GdF, which has many members in the German air traffic control.
The European Commission has been accused of being behind the pilot mishaps.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost savings and staff savings in the national air traffic control units are now being fully passed on to the operational business.
The Commission has already adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the EU's targets are aligned until 2024 and further tightening is expected.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in the last few years", Maas said.
He hopes that the high cost of delay will make airlines change their minds.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German Federal Aviation Safety Service (DFS) offers a "sound training and future pact", Maas said.
The admission of 120 pupils for the next five years is just enough to compensate for the drop-out due to age.
The necessary staffing has not yet been added.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for restructuring of the group
The members of the ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for restructuring the group.
The Commission has already stated that it will not be able to accept the amendments proposed by the Council.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reductions in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory board on the capital side only counts eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to it.
The final decision is expected to be taken by the general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with its Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, will be the bundling of the elevator business and the subcontracting business.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence activists.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have led to violent clashes, with many injured.
According to the city administration, on Saturday about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered, as well as about 6000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police have used a large-scale order to try to keep the two protests away from each other.
According to the operatives, however, pro-independence activists repeatedly tried to break through the security lockdown.
They said they attacked the officers with paint and rounds.
There were also clashes between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police have announced six arrests.
Better pay and respect from colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had taken action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government, almost exactly a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than them.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why have they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez to AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they trashed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic policeman, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, denied the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: defend the law", he said.
But the demonstration is to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it's a big European city and there's more echo here.
He and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman assured.
Failure to allow access to personal data of UK ministers
A security breach in a mobile app has led to the personal data of ministers and MPs from Britain's conservative Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown persons after the breakdown was revealed the day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people stuck on B217

Juventus coach praises Ronaldo after top-flight match
The Portuguese star striker "played his best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) win against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo has had a lot of fun and is doing well", said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after the early setback by the goal of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst persecutor for the time being.
The goalkeeper, who was hired by Real Madrid, initially replaced the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26./49).
And after a corner by headball, Ronaldo also made the preliminary work for the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many lessons", the coach said.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the striker, who is both the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get better at handling him", the coach insisted.
The top scorer for Juve is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the dominance of Juventus seems to be becoming even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the perfect series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already six points ahead of Naples.
The second-placed player, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But after the dismissal of Mario Rui (58th), who had already been warned, the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the field after a hard start against Paulo Dybala with yellow and red.
"We played well against a good Napoli", commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also invited to speak.
The German international has won his case at Juve.
The Liverpool FC professional has been involved in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was blown off the field in the 2-0 victory of Turin and is banned for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name.
In a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye", says the musician.
"The entity formerly known as Kanye West", he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince, as he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not new, though.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most used word in the Bible and it means 'you'", the rapper said.
I'm going to the club.
You got it!
Hoetmar's trainer Averhage did not hide his disappointment.
That was a weak play from us today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we almost never put him in trouble".
Two goals in 90 minutes, that's rarely a positive way to play a game.
The club was relegated to the second division after a 0-2 loss to SG Sendenhorst.
The SG also had only two chances in the first round, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to take the lead early (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work of Krause, he ignited free-standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when first Moritz Höne failed to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all won the competition.
A hand-off meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - could also not be used by Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75).
It was not until Nils Berheide kicked the ball over the line that the match was decided (81st).
"We had been harshly criticising ourselves before, but today was different from the last few weeks", said Florian Kraus.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the Directive to include the protection of the environment and the environment from the harmful effects of pollution.
The goal was scored by 0:1 Krause (7), 0:2 Berheide (81).
Red card: Kortenjann (75) from the Hoetmar.
The club's most recent success was in the second division, where they won the league title in the first half of the season.
"I don't know what to think", he said.
"We haven't had access to them at all". He probably meant the winged lizard with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites who were coming out with a collective offensive.
He laughed: "A dirty victory", he said, winking and then pulling his players' hands. But it was a relief to note that they had pulled themselves out of the mess with three points.
After a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the class title.
With understandably mixed emotions, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"This was by far our best performance of the season", he says.
"The way we came back from a 2-0 deficit, the way we held it all season against one of the top teams in the league, that was really phenomenal".
The more bitter it is to have to go home empty-handed.
Top goal scorer Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24).
He needed exactly two touchdowns in this game for that goal.
He scored the winning goal for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
"What he did was madness", Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf managed to equalize: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through into the long goal (45.).
After the change of sides, it was McGill who again equalised (59.).
After that, it was back and forth.
It was a sharp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64), and only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was out (69).
Despite the advantage, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (80.) again.
We need to focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now", said Lewandowski.
The first is the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the principle of equal treatment.
The goals were scored by Zymner (24), Fröhning (39), McGill (45), Nübel (64), Horstmann (69), Jülkenbeck (80) and Nübel (32).
Yellow to red: Atalan (74./Albachten) The following is the list of the countries by the number of deaths per year.
TSV Straßberg won the match against Primus
There was no winner in the Bundesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0: 0.
Media: The entire board of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire board of football's second-tier club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets referred unanimously to a joint letter from the Saxony Council.
The association was not initially confirmed.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles in the former Bundesliga player.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's good he's gone.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany is as much a relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many people thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing is offering about 80 seminars until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has indicated that he would like to collect the Toleranz Prize personally in Tutzing.
The time of office was too short for Christian Wulff: as Federal President he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But Wulff was a guest there before and after.
The Academy's director Udo Hahn was so pleased with him that he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have been with us". The fact that the Academy in the Tutzing Castle was frequented by celebrities was also a theme during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, the songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, and on September 29 the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also admitted that he will personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 sessions through mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is not secure!" read one conference headline.
'SOS at the borders of Europe' - this is how the Academy describes the 'risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean'.
"And to a conference on Syria, "Barbarism without limits".
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - war is the mockery of every human idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the divide between the rich and the poor to the radical transformation of work through digitalization.
Hahn, the director of the Academy, was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting of the 200th.
The first is the need to make the European Union more competitive in the field of research and technological development.
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent affiliated with the Evangelical Church", said Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, who led the study, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Musikkabarett: understanding of gender with the heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christchurch in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret star, Teubner imagined the gender understanding, not only with humor and heartwarm for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She put the mini guitar in and also mastered her violin.
Ben was on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even speaks until the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied by Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was that, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, in the way that it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had created a paradox: a man is satisfied when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door with no partner to open is of no use.
The piano solo demonstrates the same: what would have emerged from Mozart's composition, if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So does the super-crust slip through in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony to a playful little dance.
There was a big applause and "Bravo" from the packed hall.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, was not to be outdone.
She had the idea to give the duo a performance in Wolbeck, in addition to Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he's going to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in its lawsuit of making false and misleading statements.

After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised the death toll downwards.
It was reported that 10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
All are now released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had been kept in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released later today, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus had been crashing head-on against a guide board on Saturday morning.
Handball: Ahlener SG retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlens had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"I was really happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on them", said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
His focus on the final made his team miss this one.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a backlog, was at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.).
It was only towards the end that the wider bench of the hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed back-room Merle Klement on the left wing, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
The Commission has also examined the application of the principle of equal treatment to the situation of women in the labour market.
Volleyball: third league women: top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
The BSV Ostbevern women's volleyball team has once again established itself in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
In the second division relegate VC Allbau Essen, the blue and white won 3-1.
"That was a giant step for a cool season.
It's a bummer to be in the top third of the league.
We have worked on that", said coach Dominik Münch, who was pleased with his team's almost impeccable performance in the knockout stages.
The first passage was dominated by the guests almost at will.
He went over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 to the previous year's runner-up with 25:15.
Food was accepted in two bars, but not in play.
We've kept them busy.
Our opponent has taken a high-risk approach, but has also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV was already leading with 12:8.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Food was all over the place and we were a little spoiled", said Mr Münch.
At 18:17 the women's volleyball team from the Ruhr region was in the lead for the first time.
Zwark countered four more sets at 19:24, but the fifth attempt was successful.
"The game was now a grade better", the instructor said of the leveling up.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge played a major role in the BSV turning the tables in the third period from 14:16 to 25:21 with their upsets.
Munich: "We played consistently and calmly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue and Whites brought fourth with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had a great day too.
The Commission has also proposed that the Member States should be given the possibility of applying the principle of equal treatment to the treatment of women in the same way as men.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of debris in German-Turkish relations that can only be repaired with difficulty", said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the Editorial Network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed the chance of a joint, conciliatory approach.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' belonging to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the term for his own purposes", Sofuoglu lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has reinforced "many reservations".
Nottuln home club: the offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally time for the reunion.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 19.30 the Nottuln home club will host its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
It's almost a year since we first held a folk meeting.
This event has now become a regular feature of the musical calendar in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln Heimatverein.
I had no idea that our folk meeting in Nottuln would take off so quickly.
Whether it was a winter storm in January or a heat wave in July, the fireplace in the county office was always full.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sailing songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits", says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who often invites his musician friends to Nottuln.
For the first folk meeting "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed with his accordion.
He was for many years a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with plain German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten enthralled the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the night" and sent home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend another evening of fun and fellowship", says the invitation from the local association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be involved is invited to join in.
Since the most popular seats are always quickly filled, it is advisable to arrive early.
The meeting starts at 7:30, but the entrance is at 7:00.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be settled by October 24th.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair take another step towards becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
The billions of dollars of merger still awaits approval in South Korea and - the biggest hurdle - in the US.
The last time the chances of an agreement had improved there, according to an insider, because Linde had agreed to sell additional parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be settled by 24 October for the merger to be successful.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
A gala was held in the Dr. Stammberger Hall to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and landscaping.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kulmbach District Association for Horticulture and Landscape Care were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a great jubilee in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
However, it was called something else at the time: as "Bezirksfrugtbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" it was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was really all about fruit growing, and no one thought about flowers and gardening back then.
"At that time, in the Age of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite of the elite", said Günter Dippold, a district caretaker, in his speech.
Fruit trees were planted along highways, and so-called industrial gardens were created near schools.
Fruit growing is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which include almost 7000 members.
But this is far from the end of the spectrum.
The role of local horticulture, nature conservation, village beautification and nutrition is as important as the teaching of knowledge, healthy eating and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how varied the tasks of a horticultural club are on stage.
"Youth work is particularly important in the digital age", said the district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of nature experiences for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us kids, and I doubt that you can collect as much joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with the district councillor Klaus Peter Söllner.
"The decision on where they should be placed is up to the district association", added Landrat Söllner, emphasising the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun also made it clear that this is a real concern for the many horticultural associations in the district.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the circle association with a picture lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, it was stored for the winter.
However, by the end of the 1950s, the garden had been transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature is here, it was here before us, and we must learn from it", argued the expert in fruit and nut trees.
So let there be an incentive for the horticultural vineyards not to give up, so that our home will remain beautiful and worth living.
The Commission's proposal is to be adopted by the Council on the basis of a proposal from the Commission.
'We must put an end to the glaring decline in insects, and we owe it to our children and grandchildren,' concluded Günter Reif at the end of the successful celebration, which was celebrated by the tower blowers of the Thurnau music club.

Priority for NAFTA talks: Canadian foreign minister transfers UN speech
The Mexican government wants clarity on the Nafta issue: they are giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech at the United Nations.
In the face of the pressing need to negotiate a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
The minister will not speak before the UN General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she's focusing on renegotiating NAFTA.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, had said on Friday that the negotiators from Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree on whether Canada wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between Mexico and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to a revision of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump has hinted that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
The agreement is expected to be finalized by Sunday evening (local time), and the Trump administration plans to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
It is unclear whether the 63-year-old will make any public appearances in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in the open street during an election campaign event in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "He who is not") women's organizations in particular called for protests against the ex-military.
The social networks also mobilized the associations against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore barred from running.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7th.
As the former mayor of São Paulo, a city of millions, Haddad has so far far lagged far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently he has presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, a run-off election will be held on 28 October.
Observers predict that Bolsonaro will not be able to win this one - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for his anti-gay and anti-black propaganda and glorification of the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks me with verbal lapses.
On another occasion he said that the followers of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe regains Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale on the outskirts of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn's underdog team, in front of more than 150,000 spectators, over three days at Le Golf National, with great strokes and outstanding team spirit, dethroned the favored U.S. champion by a toothless Tiger Woods.
Danish rock legend dies after a long illness
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larssen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was said to have been surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's break-up in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album Midt om natten is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in everyone's heart".
The Prime Minister also recalled that in 2010 the anti-monarchist Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at pressurized air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a re-description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Civic Centre Shoe Factory: pure hard rock by three bands who were friends with each other.
After the sound check and just before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of the Lampenfever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands enthrall the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" Rocknight visibly.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika also knows how to convince with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the CD that will be released soon.
The band dances to the harmonious and pressing music of the concert.
Although the cries of "add-on" are unheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock, demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock also uses a synthesizer.
Not only is the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivating in the change from melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, since its foundation in 2005, acquired a special level of fame.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that The Ignition has a special stage experience with their performances in front of a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also adds his own accent to the only cover song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
With the sound of the band moving higher than ever, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a solo that is applauded by the audience.
The "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the Mischpult team, is about 98 decibels for the trio concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is about the level of a compressed air hammer, but is still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", as "The Ignition" points out on its website.
The deafening 120 decibels in the sound of the engine, as is usual at the annual metal festival in the north of the Republic, however, the chosen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking style have already convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we are, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups can say, in the end, although in a figurative sense.
And most of all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.
Red-Weiss Cuxhaven wins in the second round of Lamstedt
The footballing magert food, long time without tension, was offered to the spectators on Hertas height at the game between TSV Lamstedt and Rot-Weiss Cuxhaven.
Only at the end of the
Penguins battle for the win against Mannheim
The Fishtown Penguins have celebrated a victory against the big favorite Adler Mannheim after a great battle on the 6th game day of the DEL.
No to Hate and Violence
The message was clear: An estimated 1,200 Cuxhaveners from all parts of society said "No to hatred and violence" in Kaemmererplatz.
One person killed in a sailplane accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near the airport in Mülheim/Essen.
As reported by the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a glider had crashed in the fairgrounds of the airport.
The pilot was killed in the process.
The WAZ reports that the student was alone on the plane - the plane is said to have been a single-seater.
The plane was already on approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a tent on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend, there's been an Oktoberfest.
The airport is located on the border between the two cities in the Ruhr area and directly at the exit to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump says to Kim, "And then we fell in love".
It's no secret that US President Kim Jong-un is a very well-intentioned leader despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, Trump has made a full-blown declaration of love to his colleague.
It's also related to Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragic thing is, it's a long distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Trump was almost fond of the half-brotherly descendant of the Pyongyang ruling dynasty, even though he is proving to be a tough-guy in the fight for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and we went back and forth", Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
You got it?
No, I really did.
And it wasn't just the conversations with Kim that would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
The personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced halting of all nuclear and missile tests, although critics have so far seen little more than lip-service.
The US president seemed to be well aware that not everyone would be familiar with his affection for the "Rocket Man", Trump's nickname for Kim, who is notorious for his martial menace gestures.
Anyway, he anticipated the criticism that would follow his performance at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he didn't care, Trump explained, pointing his index finger at the crowd, "I've always told you it's so easy to be president".
But then, instead of 10,000 people outside squeezing into this packed arena, we would have 200 people outside.
The Oktoberfest attracts many visitors to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is the best visited, atmospheric and also pampered by the sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city centre has been brushed out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not only held in the festive tent at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade union on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to highlight their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the video in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July, risking their lives and distributing it online.
"They refuse to send us back", said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The video was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria", Efe Onyeka, who shot the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
He said that the video put his life in danger.
One of his fellow fighters was beaten nearly to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks".
They didn't give us any food, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent home this year through the programme, said Jorge Galindo, IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians rescued was not unusual in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He's never heard of a call for help from a cell phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhuman.
The North African state, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare for her Monday's class, she was surprised by a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the first floor hallway, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who began investigating.
Whether any money or belongings were stolen is yet to be determined.
The perpetrator is described as being about 16 years old, black, with short hair, slightly darker complexion, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspectorate Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his car for days.
A 75-year-old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forested area in the middle of the country after he had driven the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance near a pasture and rescued the missing since Tuesday evening, the police announced on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to going home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a trip in his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive searches, the man's whereabouts remained unknown for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the Commission's proposal to introduce a new system for the collection of data on the use of the Internet.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This is particularly true of the wave of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore "made clear to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important precondition for this".
The Commission is also proposing to extend the period of validity of the Directive to the next five years.
He said he expected freedom of expression to be respected.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a Federal Ministry of Defence air-readiness building at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was to be held at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused this for political reasons against Erdogan.
After the meeting, Erdogan travelled to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the construction.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country".
And we are also their point of contact - not the Turkish President.
North Korea calls for disarmament: lack of confidence in the US
While US President Trump does not tire of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime presents the situation more soberly.
Secretary Ri is demanding a deal from Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent stall comes from the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence building", Ri said in New York.
The Commission has not yet taken any action to deal with the matter.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves", the North Korean chief diplomat said.
The idea that punitive measures could bring North Korea to its knees is "a nightmare for people who don't know us".
The EU's foreign policy is based on the principle of the free movement of goods and services.
The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr Genscher, said that the EU had not yet made a decision on the issue.
The UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times in the past year alone because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been urging strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met for the first time with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is due to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually at a youth meeting was not revealed to the many visitors to the open house: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The youngsters of the HoT were delighted with the buffet of delicacies from various countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was funded by donations from the community, for which the youths wanted to thank with food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day of summer vacation, the bad news came: A power failure had shut down the huge two-part refrigerator, the food had spoiled, and it had to be thrown away.
"We had to start again: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it on their own", says Westbuer.
And so they all joined in.
The result was visible, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Cooks can't do better", one visitor exclaimed with admiration as Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were treated to quiche, liver cheese, or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have done", said Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was astonishing with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of directors of NRW
Frustrated by criticism from within his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his post in the national association.
Sartor had become nationally known because the Essen board had introduced a ban on foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW-Tafels in July, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
I've had too many hits on the back.
The head of the Land Association of the North Rhine-Westphalia, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding towards the dpa for the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor has taken the criticism.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who have spoken who did not know exactly why the Essen tablet does that".
Sartor was still active for the Essen table, however - "six days a week, nothing changes", says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues from other boards in the "Welt am Sonntag".
We must not take the approach of "without us, the people in the city will starve".
It was the state's job to ensure that people didn't starve.
At a congress of the tablets on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not participate.
"I'm told too much sweet schmus", he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me back then.
The two-time champion of the European Union, the German national team, is in the final.
The football team of the district league Lorch lost to Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a loss - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly came up behind with 0:1 but won after 90 minutes with 2: 1. At the top of the table, the SGB, meanwhile, was able to win with 3: 0
Gladbach has lost its two-time lead - Schalke without an embolo with its first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach will have to wait for a home win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play twice a lead.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1: 0).
(sda) Schalke have been knocked out of the first five league games four times by early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco has again put on the strength with which it had taken first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after a strong preparation by Jewgeni Konopljanka by head, in the result the hosts conserved the mini padding with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets the new leader of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded against Bayer Leverkusen until the break a 0:2 gap, but came in the second half still to a 4: 2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65) and Marco Reus (69) equalized with a double in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another double in the final (86/94) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
The Stuttgart players were afraid of Werder Bremen, who had been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious one-off own goal that helped the visitors to equalize in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not unsuccessful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and the long-retired Gladbacher gave a two-time lead out of the hand, eventually playing 2:2 and still waiting since 2003 for an away win in the VW-city.
The match was tied 1-1, with Renato Steffen with his second Bundesligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the 20 meter flare of the Aargauer, as well as at the second counter-hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is the goalkeeper in the Storm of the Foals.
Wolfsburg faced the OGC Nice for the third consecutive time and the seventh time in the seventh game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach is in fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen against VfB Stuttgart found themselves in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team: The 23-year-old Serb cashed after a trick-taking sacrifice against Daniel Didavi yellow-red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen through a curious throw-in goal (68.) back into the game, a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart team back to the victory lane.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens had already put the home team on the course by foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether to change the name of their country to North Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the nearly three-decade-long conflict with neighboring Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name, and it blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The United States had announced that if the referendum was successful, the country could become a member of NATO as soon as possible.
Syrian in custody.
Fugitive attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners, some of whom were seriously injured.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had been rioting in the escape route in Alsergrund on Friday at around 10 pm.
When the police arrived, they questioned the accused, who was throwing his fists at passersby and trying to attack them, about his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officials.
Shortly afterwards it was discovered that the suspect had just beaten three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists in the street of Währinger at a tram stop.
He also kicked the trio.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered bruises, contusions, and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured, "for reasons as yet unknown", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
They got engaged in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told Bild newspaper.
"If we get married, we'll do it right". He said he'd been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the SPD's spokesman on budgetary policy and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheim circle, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a sensation with a speech on June 30, 2017.
He also said that the EU should be able to take action to help the refugees.
"That was your Schabowski moment", he said, referring to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Before that, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption rights.
Garden day: 400 metres of hedge cut
There was a lot of work to do for the members of the Children's Home Association and the Leprosy Society.
Because about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründner House should be cut.
With the support of the residents, about a dozen supporters got to work.
"We are doing this to cut costs", said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens' Union.
And it's also accumulated quite a bit.
We're late this time because of the hot summer, but fortunately it's just a trim.
Because they've already shaved the hedge once in the spring.
The tradition of having breakfast after work has also been around for a long time.
"Everyone should keep their strength up", said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold in the slalom canoe world championship
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put down a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the track and everything was fine today", said the London 2012 Olympic third-place finisher.
At the finish, he threw away his paddle in joy and held up both arms in victory - knowing that it would at least be enough for a medal.
He was the number four starter.
However, the six remaining starters were unable to match his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second to the Russian Pawel Eigel.
Gauting Police Department reports the first break-in attempt this fall in a single-family home.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed to do so.
The days are getting shorter - and burglars are taking advantage of that.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first break-in attempt this autumn.
The alarm system is responsible for the fact that it remained at the one-family house on Königswieserstrasse.
It was triggered when the perpetrators came in Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not home.
But the alarm apparently caught them off guard, and they fled without any loot.
Information for the PI Gauting, telephone number (089) 8 93 13 30
The German club is in a very difficult situation.
The predicate of unbeatability is gone: FC Bayern will not "let themselves be defeated" by defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will determine the first interim result for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase for the Munich to the greater autumn low.
"A week ago, we were considered invincible.
The European Parliament has been given a very important role in the process of European integration.
If you know us, you know that's what really upsets us, and that's why we're going for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no own goal was scored, as at the same time of the preseason two games in a row without victory, the leader in the football Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
The overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg, with its intense man-against-man tactics, and the Berliners with their playful pin-pointing on the outside, have delivered two blueprints in three days, as the last overpowering Bayern are to be cracked.
'Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not be satisfied with this and we will do everything to make sure that we are successful again,' Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, he dealt with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and only blamed his first defeat as Munich coach on the again deficient handling of chances.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft budget and on the draft budget for the next financial year.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second appearance of this season in the top division after the 2-0 win at Benfica Lisbon.
After the Sunday off day, the short preparation for the second preliminary match against Ajax, which had also won 3-0 against AEK Athens, began as planned.
"We've been beaten in two games, but we'll score again", announced the national team captain, Manuel Neuer.
As was the case after the losing Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich was the clear winner.
The legal counsel acted as a warning.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work on it again, because we don't take the many chances and make the mistakes in the back", the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh game day of the previous season, the Bavarians were even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead with a one-point lead.
And so Kimmich with a wink at least positively assessed that now the public debate about the supposedly invincible Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good", said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the line of fire: Özil-Causa: Erdogan's sharp attacks on Grindel
The European Parliament has already taken a number of important decisions on the basis of the European Parliament's resolution of 16 December 1990 on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
DFB President Grindel sees the mistakes, but defends the union line.
Now a new post is to be created.
- Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages in Berlin for the supremacy of interpretation in the permanent dispute issue Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president sharply criticized the treatment of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association's line.
Early Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced in the Mainz ZDF "Sportstudio" consequences from the Causa.
"We must be very careful in the future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - to conclude that this will not happen again", said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
The report also calls for the establishment of a European Union-wide network of experts in the field of human rights.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
You have excluded them from this society because you took pictures with me in England", Erdogan said in the cathedral on Saturday.
Frankly, as your president, I couldn't bear to see our two young men, who had risen to the German national team, left out.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would be taking on players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am migrant - that is not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression", Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said so.
He also does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer is to be appointed in addition to Cacau, a native Brazilian, and Celia Sasic, whose family roots are in Cameroon.
"If someone with no migration background can clearly influence society and football and say 'this is important, we have to take care of it', this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration has to work", Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup defeat and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office of DFB president next year.
"I do my work and try to do it as well as I can", Grindel said.
Jähriger builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a woman at the red light in the Lauterer Height area.
She told the pensioner that he had run into her car.
But no personal contact was made, as the 75-year-old man could not find the lady in the parking lot.
Shortly thereafter, the police received a phone call about a driver who had veered off the road and hit a traffic sign.
When asked, the man did not want the police on the scene and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner lost his way in his home town, where he has lived for decades, and crashed into a construction truck while turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and arrest him.
His car was damaged.
The 75-year-old looked confused and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: nearly 1000 emergency personnel are still on the job.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand fire at a German army camp in Emsland, 980 emergency workers are still involved in the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to stabilise, a spokesman said, 70 volunteers have been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency workers is planned, it is said.
A fire had been discovered and extinguished in the night of Sunday.
Last week, the disaster declaration, issued a week earlier on September 21, was lifted because of fears that the flames could endanger neighboring forests and settlements by wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was announced that the fire was no longer threatening to spread to neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency workers were on the scene trying to bring the fire under control.
The Luftwaffe is continuing to support the work at the Bundeswehr site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
The Bundeswehr has also announced that reconnaissance flights with Tornados are scheduled for October 2 and 5.
The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke from the Moorbrands had at times traveled up to 100 kilometers across northwest Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point to receive reports of damage.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hotel and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the St. Katharines Church in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after marriage for all came into force, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They've been together for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the introduction of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
They said yes to each other in Hamburg on Saturday.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos is a good example of the kind of legislation which is needed in the Member States.
If we get married, we'll do it right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for the budgetary policy of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer circle, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir with a furious speech on June 30, 2017.
He said that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) had "stumbled" over the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment", he said, referring to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement that the GDR border had been opened.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just as heterosexuals can.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
Referendum on new state names launched in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
The neighbouring country of Greece insists on this, because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement of Skopje with the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also be giving the go-ahead for the integration of their country with the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the Holocaust from oblivion

The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a legacy that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve stressed relatives.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be removed only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
It's supposed to make organ donation easier and relieve stress for family members.
People who want to donate their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained from Swisstransplant if needed.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
It is estimated that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor's card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the time a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives are unaware of the deceased's wishes.
"They have to make decisions on behalf of the deceased, which is often very difficult", says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany, there are plans to store information on possible organ donations on the health insurance card, says Marita Völker-Albert, spokeswoman for the Federal Health Information Centre.
"There is no register in which people can put their wishes - for or against organ donation - " she says.
The Federal Minister for Health, Jens Spahn, has spoken in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
He proposed that everyone be considered an organ donor unless he or his family objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
A 14-year-old student is the world's master of mental calculation.
Tomohiro Iseda, a 14-year-old Japanese student, is the world champion in the art of head-counting.
He won against 39 of his teammates at Wolfsburg last weekend.
This was reported by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, on Sunday.
Wenzel Grüß, 16 years old, from Germany, came in third.
The youngest participant was a 12-year-old Japanese schoolboy, and the oldest was a 74-year-old retired Frenchman, said referee Ralf Laue.
The competition is organised every two years by the computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony).
For example, the previous problems were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Because spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where contestants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how to hold a ball with his head in the air while doing arithmetic.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already there two years ago, when he was 14 years old, in Bielefeld.
Terms such as superbrain, genius or wonder child are of little use to Laue.
"Mind can be trained", he said.
Many of the participants practiced for several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computer competitions in stadiums.
For example, one of the disciplines is the problem of taking the square root of six-digit numbers.
In the case of the multi-dimensional calculus, the candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The main referee said that the Germans would also have good chances here.
Otherwise, Asians often have an advantage, because they learn to do head-count more intensively and with other, more effective methods at an early age.
The video of Serena Williams naked is about early detection of breast cancer.
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to raise awareness of breast cancer and to promote early detection.
It's a matter of life and death, but it's also a matter of courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams is singing "I Touch Myself" by The Divinyls topless - only her hands are covering her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from it.
This emotional video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which focuses on early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed blood clots in Serena's lungs.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The German government is planning to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week the Turquoise and Blue Coalition will submit a draft law to the so-called "Symbol Law" for review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Cold polar air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle will be shaking out of her bed for the first time in the West next week: polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists from the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters with strong intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohen Tauern, snowfall is expected to reach 20 to 40 centimetres above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintery. The road conditions are not the same as in the winter.
Farmers may start annual grooming on Monday
The farmers of Schleswig-Holstein are allowed to start their annual cleaning on Monday.
The unique "green cliffs" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for some 200 years.
The tree and shrub heaps, up to five meters wide, are "a forest" and the last refuge of many animals and plants.
The Knicks are corridors linking dispersed habitats where the exchange of organisms can still take place, said Ingo Ludwichowski, the managing director of the Nature Conservation Union of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were established by order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, but also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
The name "Knick" also comes from this period: by "turning" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, between the North and Baltic Seas, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges form a richly wooded landscape with a variety of structures.
According to NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by some 7,000 species.
One kilometer of the Knick could house up to 1,800 different species and up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment and the environment.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the crop can only be grown outside the breeding season from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesian speaks about the situation on the ground
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you present during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes hit, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately set out on my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport in Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport to allow relief supplies to be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office was destroyed, but we've set up temporary quarters where we've housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have fled to surrounding hills, where they still remain in fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water or food.
Some people are standing outside their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are closed, people are stealing some of the food and gas.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some prisoners are still at large and it is difficult to find them.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people are still missing and unknown.
How are the communications and information systems on the island?
We have cell phone reception now, but it didn't work before and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, who they do not know if they are alive and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but were, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on that?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many people thought, "Okay, no tsunami", and then it came.
In other areas not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami was coming to the area and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, unprepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and we also train evacuation.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must for a long time do without Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be absent from VfB Stuttgart for a long time with severe muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a muscle fiber tear in his left hindquarters in the 2-1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga player announced on Sunday.
Doctors diagnosed Donis with a muscle tear in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the next international break.
The Commission notes that the aid granted to VfB Stuttgart was not granted by the State.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, while a muscle fiber rupture usually heals slightly faster.
The triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival is the last of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the rejections, we can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, with strong entries from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that could attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department attempted to capture an injured duck.
The action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was put to use.
Olching - Walking along the shores of Lake Olching, a white, injured duck was spotted on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water control station.
To help the animal, passersby called the police and the fire department.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, were unsuccessful.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the task forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the sea.
A rescue boat enabled the firefighters to surround the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box by a firefighter with a hardened handle after almost an hour.
The duck, which had been injured in the chest, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is aiming for a World title
Fourth place at the Olympia Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in his stomach for a long time.
The Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund next winter.
The final shot cost the 31-year-old Olympic sprinter of Pyeongchang the near-catch medal.
Seven tenths of a second to go on bronze.
"I've deliberately taken time to process this", says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the Constitution to a major event, to win something.
You gotta hit him sometime.
The World Cup in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race in the previous year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup in the mass start of Kontiolahti (FIN).
He finished second in Oslo (NOR) with the squad.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at full speed
Time is extremely limited and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation in full swing, Republicans in the U.S. Senate are trying to secure a slim majority for judge-elect Brett Kavanaugh, who has been the subject of controversy over allegations of sexual harassment.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to solve the alleged incidents that date back more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding the culture-battle Kavanaugh's appeal was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer lashed out furiously against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the ultra-conservative Supreme Court justice.
The Republican majority seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After some tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday's severe weather "a scare", initially refrained from further attacks on the women and instead spoke of "luck in misfortune".
He said that this would be the only way to remove any remaining doubts.
Later, at a rally, Trump lashed out at the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh, saying, "You're trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has severely limited the powers of the investigators.
The government will be investigating the allegations made by two women, but that's it, a government official told the Wall Street Journal. "They're not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
The mobile radar device of the Municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle" to monitor the speed limit, is stationed at the Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1, according to the Municipality.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after the victory against Mainz: Fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, against Mainz, the time factor also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist when it comes to football matches.
It was the same in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area", said the sporting director of Schalke 04 - and took a breath.
After all, the King's Blues had managed to beat the Rhine Horses 1-0 and thus take the first win of the season under the roof.
It could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given assurance Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing"., played with increasing playing time obviously more and more of the head a role.
I 'm not really a head-ball monster .
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me", said Heidel. "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to let it go, so they kept backing away.
And defended Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all felt a huge weight falling off our hearts", said Schöpf, who had a significant part in the head-ball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the world".
But in the end, it's the winning that counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including, of course, at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with a lot of pressure in the early days and turn it into a fireworks display", said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
We're gonna have a few hours of fun.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played smart, calm and brave, so we've got to go for 90 minutes.
Perhaps the biggest flaw of the afternoon was that KINGSBLU missed the opportunity to look for a clearer picture.
The possibilities were there, for example, with the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a tremor", said Tedesco. "You have already felt the fear a little".
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only one who was.
Fish-bachau: Pillar of smoke in the Leitzacht valley 2 km visible
The smoke was unmistakable.
A hiker in the Leitzach valley observed a fire from a distance of about two kilometers on Sunday at about 1:30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The police and fire department soon found out the cause: An unknown person had set fire to a two-square-meter area of garbage on Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it looked like he had been monitoring the fire for a while, but then left the embers unattended.
And that's near the forest.
Thirty fish-farming firefighters were engaged in the dismantling and extinguishing of the fire.
The police are investigating arson.
The European Union is a global actor, and its role is to promote the development of the European Union and to promote the development of the European Union.
In front of you is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task for many years to bring interesting people to Greven", explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the lecture very casually, describes the process of writing the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in a way that people could understand.
With a lot of gestures, concrete figures and a little bit of wit, he brings the audience closer to one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise in spite of successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
The German society is sitting at one table, and the first generation of migrants at the Catalan table.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been at the big table and now they want to have a say.
This leads to conflict.
The key question is not whether one is politically to the right or left, but whether one is for or against an open society.
The first is to behave more calmly, and then the second is to get more and more excited.
And there is a need for a speech.
An Afghan refugee tells from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is in front, not on the stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is glad that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions", says El-Mafaalani.
The following signing hour was also a time of intense discussion, with the guests' questions being heard and Kurdish specialties served in the foyer.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
Gießen won in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The season's first leader is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champion Bayern Munich and the former champion Brose Bamberg had much more difficulty at the beginning of the new season.
Munich already struggled on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won on Saturday the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 .
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 bidders have applied to buy one of the plots in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new development area of Landsham South on the open market.
This is from Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that the municipality offers on more favourable terms or prices - similar to the previous local model.
Frick said there were 100 applications in.
"The documents are currently being reviewed" in terms of the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have the applicant ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit it to the municipal council.
After that, the award can take place.
In total, 50 plots of land for single and double dwellings will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with eight housing units each.
The development is now well and truly complete, and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
One individual plot and two of the houses belong to a private person, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
She's selling most of it on the open market, 20 lots in a socially responsible model.
The two multi-family houses in the community are to be built as affordable housing, according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing units subsidised by the Free State.
Seating capacity for 200 persons
It is estimated that the area of the new Landsham-South development will provide housing for about 200 people.
Not only that, but now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the construction of a new day care centre is taking place there.
The project will include three nursery and three nursery groups and a multipurpose room.
The opening is planned for September 2019, for the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke Naldo's "great sport" succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row, Naldo is not in the starting line-up, but thanks to Schalke's coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues was on the bench for the third time in a row, instead of in the starting lineup, the understanding of many people would have been great if the Brazilian, who is almost two meters tall, had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered as usual in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who everyone simply calls Naldo, joined in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was great sport", Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reserve status, did not harbor any resentment.
Naldo, who was crowned best Schalker last season, probably knows that he didn't actually get in the way of his coach - but is taking a break for good reason.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him, I'm telling you that", Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he was not on the starting line.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club", Tedesco said.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It's important that everyone get a little bit of a breather.
And that we keep everyone in the boat", Tedesco explained the rotation that finally caught Naldo.
And the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age, proving himself to be a model team player on the bench.
The sentiment in Austrian industry continued to decline in August, accelerating in comparison with the eurozone.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 46.7 points below a 37-month low.
In Europe, Austria is still the third most popular country, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but still remained below the 50 point mark, which indicates growth, for the 13th consecutive month.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August, with 50.9 points.
The Greeks were the last to score (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but at a slower rate than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, the highest level since March.
"The slightly weaker downhill run could mean that the worst is over", said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry remains the number one growth bottleneck, at least in the third quarter.
A quick return to growth is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell by the largest amount since November 2011.
The companies therefore reduced their jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected a score of 47.8.
The Purchasing Manager Index draws its figures from representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
The main sources of information are turnover, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchel 's PSG team wins its eighth league game
This is the first time I've seen a person in the world like this.
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel is racing to win the French championship with Paris Saint-Germain.
At the OGC Nizza, the defending champion won thanks to two goals from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon in France had such a good start to the season was 82 years ago.
Brazil's Neymar took PSG to the lead after 22 minutes and set the record in the extra-time.
The second place was taken by Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris also managed to get the dressage for the pioneering second Champions League group game against Roter Stern Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the first round, Tuchel's team had suffered their only home defeat of the season, 3-2, in Liverpool.
