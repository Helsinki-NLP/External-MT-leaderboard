The existence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks is crucial for many of the rhythms that have been observed in physiology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not mere periodic responses to external signals, have been documented in most living things: bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are autonomous oscillators that keep on functioning for a while even if there's no external signal.
