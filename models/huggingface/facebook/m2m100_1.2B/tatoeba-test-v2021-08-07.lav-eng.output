When an English speaker notices that the foreigner with whom he speaks does not understand anything from what he said, he repeats exactly the same, but louder, as if this person was deaf. At no point comes to mind that his choice of words could be difficult, or that his expression could be easily incomprehensible to a foreigner, and that he could say it easier with other words. As a result, a person not only still does not understand what is said, but also becomes annoyed by being considered deaf.
