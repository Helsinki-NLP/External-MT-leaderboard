The study of the movement of individual vehicles and the interaction between two points and one of them is called the flow of vehicles.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to study traffic jams because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, the use of drivers was reasonably good; so the volume of vehicles was reasonably stable and numerically countable at the fingertips.
To represent traffic direction accurately, relationships are made between three key attributes: (1) direction, (2) density, and (3) speed.

The first airborne creatures were insects. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from enemies and to find food and companions.
