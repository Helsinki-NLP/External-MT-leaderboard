Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried they'll be taken for monicreques.
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, now referred to as AM, over the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose over plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all over the world fear being ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the new name rima would be Twp and Pwp.
For those who do not know Welsh, twp means parvo and pwp means caca.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group as a whole was not happy and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an open mind about the name change, but pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the designation of the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received majority support in a public consultation.
It looks like the A.M.s are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules for disabling the AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote will decide to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the referendum's proponents, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin keep silent while the churches of Harlem continue to fight
"The elders I spoke with said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other.
He said he could understand the bars were gone.
"Now people socialize in other ways", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that people usually go to.
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of the kind of people who wouldn't help keep neighborhoods from being sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's friends made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly christened the bell as the "Bells of the Poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who changed it to the major carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place at St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish and consisting of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "promises to impact the costs" of the council, even though it had not participated in hiring the architects and contractors it sent to the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounds a boy while fishing lobster in California
Police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing underwater in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching a loach, but he soon realized he was screaming.
They got me!
Hammel said it was knocked out when the boy arrived.
"I told everyone who came out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescue man, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that they saw a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami's, Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty halls similar to the big warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the UK's considerable plunge into the £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods fall, the biggest beauty retailers are set to test out in 11 stores across the country, and will move to others next year if successful.
Beauty investments are taking place at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's has stated that it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique make-up line to make most products vegan-friendly, something that's increasingly in demand by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance shop, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions at two Sainsbury's stores; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a shift that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly look more like shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, having bought the two chains two years ago.
The supermarket's previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenue to its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty halls to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel who can be reached for advice.
Our product range is designed to accommodate every need, and the attractive and practical locations mean we are now a cosmetic destination that defies our old shopping habits".
Peter Jones furious after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left furiously after TV presenter Holly Willoughby retired from an £11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his Truly homewear and accessories brand.
His company was compared to Goop, the brand name of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Peter Jones sparking as he withdrew from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the golden girl of television admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at £1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote herself to both of their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was even compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby took to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew to Britain and headed to one of his holiday residences.
One source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It would be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the project amazed.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell.
Experts believe that abandoning the This Morning hostess who is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from kitchens and candles to clothing and home textiles, and could further delay her launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple were on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we should not comment on his business matters.
A complicated conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "little proper of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by casting his voice as a "newspaper anchor".
"I gave up nothing".
He signaled that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three weeks after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" by the US to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things are going well with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship.
He claimed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had been successful: ending missile testing, helping to free hostages and bringing back the remaining American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd he had right in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge", said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute their assistance.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia endures constantly, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not uncommon to find them on other shores.
Although an alert is issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was deployed to Lombok to assist the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and generating money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration is hit by a major lack of funds in the final race for re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also affected by the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes due to street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's goalkeeper with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before shooting the second pole.
The ball flew over the area as it moved towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell on a Cape Cod flying saucer that was jumping into the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and they just knocked without thinking too much and I just shot".
Chelsea were 1-0 down at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning around halfway and entering Liverpool's field running.
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the camp.
He made a beautiful deep pass driving Hazard into the area.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished in second with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people are believed to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, a spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press release.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is covered in debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was shot dead
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in John Street, and was being held by a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
Police have asked that the people in the area who saw or heard something of this move forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call for anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the dashboard camera that contacts us, as they could have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a Birkenhead neighbor and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents just learned they won't be able to re-enter until within hours.
I heard a police officer tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene crying.
I keep saying it's horrible.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cord with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information, please send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing registration 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to rewrite history
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fanatical and puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's suggestion "disappearing" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasticity of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
They would have probably sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure many consider to still be worthy of homage.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than he is now, as a defender of parliament under external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What's clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A killer pig sneaks up on a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his nickname, "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a courtyard in Liupanshui Market, Guizhou Province.
A pig farmer prepares to place the pig vaccines in a shed on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he and his cousin had traveled Wednesdays from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to another adjacent courtyard.
He said there was a big male in the courtyard with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing nearly 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to death.
"My cousin had his legs bloodied and crushed", the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while the police were gathering evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple owned in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig ran a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "sniper".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't mean to hurt.
You just have to show them the respect they need, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and widespread rain to the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it overflows the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is hoped that Rosa will advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tidal wave begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 liters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
At the local level, rainfall of 25 to 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall of 50 to 75 litres per square meter in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 litres per square meter of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
We strongly discourage venturing into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring in locally cracked winds and dust.
The tidal wave will bring heavy rainfall locally to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 litres per m2, which in turn could cause smaller debris flows and rough roads.
These would be the first rains of the region's wet season.
Dispersed tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona in the late hours of Sunday and early Monday, before rain spreads through late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive in Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness major temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, we'll see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the central United States.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could hit 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of above-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people on six television channels have followed the passionate testimonies of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a late-night newscast on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh touched her while he was drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company reported the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that rebroadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it's an audience similar to a football final or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on Friday night TV.
After the moderate Republican office made a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being tapped by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator en route to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained with his gaze down for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm here before you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power while there are many helpless women".
Flake said his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say in the committee hearing.
All the TV and cable channels were broadcasting live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, something a minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was powerful, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and of harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, he insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should pay the tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murdered: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder.
Officers released the video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the spectacles from the scene and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was fined 350,000 US dollars.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police Criminology Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the neighborhood for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their diligence and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20.
The 2.01 year old was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "shocked and saddened" by Wayde's passing.
"This is what we worry about all the time", Wade declared.
Grey-grey volcano over Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano on Saturday after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunder and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of neighborhoods in Mexico City like Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity in the volcano located 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters confronted riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked prosecutors held by riot police, they're twisting their eggs and painting in powder that created dark dust clouds on the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
There were also refreshments later that day with the police, who used the stakes to contain the liorta.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Never Forget or Forgive" confronted unionist protesters who were shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the protest, according to local media.
Tensions continue to rage in the independence-seeking region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration occurred equally but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence rally with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy because they were able to vote, but now we're stuck together, he said.
Despite a smooth, yet decisive victory in the regional elections last December, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to keep pace, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police demonstration with her mobile, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"There's more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: A man is arrested after a car hit a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry on multiple occasions.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30pm (summer time in Britain).
Police investigative inspector Bob Blemmings has declared the raft and the building itself to be the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a bullet was fired at the car at some point.
Blood's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory.
Livingston's promotion surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second 18-game defeat as coach of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level by placing them behind Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still without a home run this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, who are eight points behind.
But first, the Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston went undefeated in the division for the sixth straight game; head coach Holt has yet to experience a defeat since replacing Kenny Miler in the past.
Livingston is letting opportunities slip in the face of weakened visitors.
Holt's team must have gotten ahead of the time they scored, as they caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers with their control.
Scott Robinson made his way but his cross shot did not cross the doorway threshold; next, Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a Craig Halkett's head from the other side of the doorway.
The host team settled for letting the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the game of still ball.
And that's how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free throw and Livingston scored a touchdown in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
The Rangers dominated the field at the time but faced an impenetrable defense that kept goalkeeper Liam Kelly from getting too much work.
That pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a halt to Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor held off a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another pitch of Livingston's still ball.
Many cross-overs were produced in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one for a hand and another for a Halkett entry to replacement Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And unanimously, they were excellent and still exceed expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His playing style and players have barely changed since he returned to the top flight, but part of the credit is to Holt for the way he has propelled the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall no respite throughout the game.
The Rangers are lacking in inspiration.
Despite working well on occasion under Gerrard's orders, this time they failed to reach that level.
They missed the last pass, only managed to penetrate the home team once, a full alert call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the board.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see his president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The mourning of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (summer time in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are road closures and buses have diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation at the high-security prison, the prison official said.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 am (UK Summer Time) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
A round-up of specialised officers has come to handle the riots, involving eight inmates who are being held in a pavilion.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff were deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it became known that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police officers had to go to prison to quell a riot in which staff were beaten with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (those affected by drought could benefit)
A tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it's most likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service stated in a Twitter post that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended over a 40-mile radius of the Arizona border".
The latest National Weather Service models predict 50 to 10 liters per square foot of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 150 liters per square foot on the Mogollon Coast of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rochosas and the Great Basin, could reach 25 or 50 litres, with possible isolated totals of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger from sudden flooding, the rain of Rose could be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by droughts.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 135 miles per hour, is 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 miles per hour.
The storm is hitting cold water in the Pacific and is therefore losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday night.
It could rain very heavily in some parts of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
"Total precipitation is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 250 l/m2 possible, reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue up through Arizona and enter southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest Desert", the National Hurricane Center reported.
It is hoped that these rains could cause sudden water storms and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old with white gunshot wounds.
The teen was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 (UK time).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains stable".
According to Somerset Police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Officials have asked for the cooperation of anyone who had a recording of the incident on their mobile.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered from the misery and anger of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the mischief and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where she categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she was sexually assaulted decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at trial about his accusation.
The president said Saturday that on that day, Americans were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the finest jurists of our time with an unpolluted public service record", he said, addressing a crowd of West Virginia admirers.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's appointment as he talked about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't compete, but I really do", he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates.
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to stand up and stand in the way.
The first Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican aide told CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds and the number continues to rise
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them swept away by giant waves that broke through beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when waves of up to six metres broke ashore in the twilight, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat came up, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they were killed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency, at a round of detention in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it swept away everything", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had been traveling high-sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many destroyed shops and buildings, retrograde and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, set at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantitative" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels would be destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications have been shut down and there is no information from Donggala, Nugroho added.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", he declared.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves would arrive at the time the warning was issued.
In a video of amateurs shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantically warning people on the street of a tsunami.
Within minutes the water collides with the shore, driving buildings and cars forward.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major outage that caused communication to be cut off throughout Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees continue to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened but only for emergency services and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's terrible.
On the way to the city of Palu, where employees are holed up in canvas shelters in the courtyard of their office, World Vision staff witnessed scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the groups began the nasty task of launching disaster relief, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with great knowledge and experience from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad can flow only if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-wide disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open up to international aid, but that's not the time yet.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the families and friends of the missing were holding on to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would alleviate the depressing argument of natural disasters.
A kid was pulled from a sink on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body in front of her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the parapet field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel's collapse among the parapente community, he desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one grey mark was shown on the messages instead of two blue marks.
I think that means the messages didn't get delivered, he added.
They steal $26,750 while they reload a cash register in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cash register in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In the press release, investigative officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a safe at the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man ran up from behind Brink's servant and stole a purse of money he had to deliver.
Witnesses said several suspects were seen leaving the scene, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known for some time as Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for emotional reasons, according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti, West had said that same year while talking about his album with Big Boy radio host.
So I am you, it's us, it's us.
I went over Kanye, which means the one, the one Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
Kanye is another famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced he preferred to call him Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also managed to put and take the script and use capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged not to reuse military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would never again use the military to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to boys who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are dragging boys into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in AI.
AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, who is an example of Google, Microsoft and Apple, says the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI given China's growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the US government made announcements about AI, even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China had presented its plan the year before: it wants to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling our AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are way behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next AI breakthrough would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat American Othello's player with the highest score, and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research, a subsidiary of Google in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
"China is not leading academic leaders, it is leading companies", he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
"I think they should offer residency cards to doctors at IA", he said.
The State Council of China published its next generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an AI Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the AI Select Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not registered any movement in months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum whether they wanted to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece and block applications for admission into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result would reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Advocates of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to pay for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament have said they would respect the outcome of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was setting a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents set up for those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high and not through the service door", Kavadarkov added.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the requirement.
Another poll by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result has to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A referendum failure would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May of the previous year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, crosses all of Brighton's defence and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's 2-0 defence against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three defenses at Brighton before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke off a defence before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touchdown to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems in the foot", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky he scored that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Devils the starting lead in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton field that game.
He sent a nice hollow pass through the right flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The Blue Devils put the ball in the gate before they left the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to throw the party in the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to force another title.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies' playoff run, which takes a game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies secured at least one home field position with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their first division title.
"Even though we don't play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I've played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals haven't announced who's opening Sunday yet, but they seem inclined to have Scherzer as the one who throws in a situation like that.
Scherzer, who would be his 34th starting pitcher, had another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely launch Sunday on his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the result in the midterm elections.
"Let's play everything we did in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't compete, but I really do, and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, by evil, and by petty.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're never going to give it to them".
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct".
"And they've seen that for the past four days", he said, calling the Democrats "annoyed, spoiled, nasty, and lying".
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public applause.
"Remember your answer?
Did you leak the document?
Mmm... what?
No, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is not so open anymore.
He's not tolerant of people expressing their opinions.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not welcomed, and all for expressing our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she confronted anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security and about Europe, issues that Jeremy had been disagreeing with previous leaders about.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday indicated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the committee's Friday night meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that's no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a more kind and gentle policy was forgotten long ago, if ever it began.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and is judging whether all views are acceptable to the party leader.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when colleagues with whom he shared a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and take positions I would never agree with, both on national security and the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact it doesn't really matter what I say, there's a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring the centre-right politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of the peers who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insults have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're not so open anymore and with every move of "no confidence" or every change in the selection rules, the game gets closer to the eyes.
Over the last few years I've received many tips that urge me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then everything would be fine for me.
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, while still at school, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government which literally dropped my classroom, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political stance and that I disagree with the current direction of the party.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, the only thing I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and utilities, I do not understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr is on the lead
The last two attempts may have altered the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this tender Tenent Premier League match.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team out of 10.
It was ultimately his defensive superiority, as well as the risk he took, that led the team to victory.
"So far we have put the test to our game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "It must be acknowledged that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than anyone else.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute practice, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made a wrong throw.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty kick, before, just in halftime, he turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr at the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
There was then a prolonged break from the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a paddle and, from the restart, Ayr progressed further through a trial by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having another player with a Bruce Colvine trial that was not completed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for appeasing Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a try from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's moul.
Climo scored, as he has done almost since the reboot, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in David Armstrong's area and sent him to third-line Gregor Henry to get the fifth practice from the local team.
The star of Still Game is starting a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to enter the restaurant industry after discovering he's been appointed CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next season will be the final, and it seems Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "prosperous" Glasgow restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's interior hopes the court will find its way to the Pacific
The sailors were looking at a shipyard covered in appliances in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
In seaward-free Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as does the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes are likely at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICC's ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a contentious re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will justify Bolivia, and that it would change little if that happens.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body has no power to claim Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the ICC's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case was not complicated, says Chilean international law expert Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be a backward screen.
"The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
Bolivia will have a fantastic opportunity on Monday to open a new stage of relations with Chile, and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using this issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to move beyond the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting a nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it is "utopia" that continued US sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War can double North Korea.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step toward disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely cover yourself in the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their 2019 Spring-Summer collection that opened to the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers took their most amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated kissing hat adorned with a wide-brimmed imitation feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Other large accessories included frozen watermelons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high-end seamstress.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving kit, with glasses and a tube, and the other one looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you're a big fan of fashion, you're in luck.
The fashion experts predicted that giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate hats come right after the Bomba, the 60-centimeter-high ball hat that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social media has brought to the runway another great creation: a beach ball bag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffle bag adorned with raffle flakes and finished with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' 2019 spring summer collection La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, 'I hope that the big beach hats and bags will hit stores next summer, as the designer has had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Private schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another outstanding test performance, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible standard for pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we're seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it's in his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the list and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages did well.
Data from the 74 schools that make up SCIS show that 72% of students have earned an honours degree in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an outstanding grade.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are being taken into consideration as well as subjects like science, technology, engineering and math in private school programs and all kinds of subjects.
A survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the reasons why employers find it difficult to fill vacancies, language skills are 17% of the reasons.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities than languages.
Regardless of the career path you choose, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for today's kids.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ by school.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others are focusing on languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of their children's interests, private schools always have multiple languages to choose from and teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish private schools specialise in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, that languages remain vital to the future of our country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron is making his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the seers who want to see LeBron James play his first game against the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still up to you how many minutes you'll play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After early-week training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career, I don't need pre-matches to be ready, he said.
Trump's election acts are coming to Virginia on his YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in nearby cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote on hold for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of this week's trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and who is holding a Senate confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with fresh momentum.
So these five rallies that Trump will be holding next week are all about "dynamizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in the run-up to the campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman who chose not to be named told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, the latest in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows resilience to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's individual games
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing swing swing is a totally invented sporting concept but what athletes really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I guess we took that as a little boost", Jordan Spieth said as he walked out at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little bit of a wind in their favor and a lot to cheer for, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each had three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and he's preaching by example.
Those guttural cries got louder as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
When he got the putt that got them to win the game on the 15th, he shouted a similar one, the kind of shout that he says he thinks the American team isn't out yet.
"You just have to focus and worry about your game", Spieth said.
He's the only one left for these players right now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That route, and the way it seems to flow its energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals beating on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to achieve a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dismissed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first lap ended the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they were never close to getting out of.
But there won't be anyone to help us out of the hole on Sunday.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close by the interactions between pairs, the advice you give, the advice you don't and how you can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have a significant lead on the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after dropping out of the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to climb four points to the score at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, seeking to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, beat a US team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but they could not cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four straight points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to score four points from the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed on fourballs, they perfectly matched to defeat a disfigured Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without any regrets or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of 29 games in the fourball and foursomes modes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested on the morning fourballs, reunited as partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating world No. 1 and No. 3 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
Europe could not always win on a nice breezy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American benchmark by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history in which a team has scored four points in the singles, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to draw to retain it.
However, after being the second-best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of his reach.
The North Koreans say no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing its distrust of the United States and that the country would not surrender its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US", he added.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part.
While Ri was echoing the already well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual denuclearization" whereby North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean Peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the tightening of international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive target, even if it opposes 'declaration of war'", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel down is an impossible dream for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other part of this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached a dead end.
Still, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the evil President Trump called Kim Jong-un a rocket in a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline for that, and it's still two years, three, five months".
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that "compliance with the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe complete, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making "mafia-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took the appropriate measures.
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is getting all its students to sleep more in order to combat the growth of the caffeinated, all-night studying male culture.
One scholar found that students at the number one university in the world often lack the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the class, a young girl came up to me and said, 'Why don't you tell me this now, my senior year?'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, teaches students the basics of how to get good sleep habits that help with academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night, he says, still exists. And he adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that involved sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep and good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he points out. Even avoiding fattening, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which causes it to constantly get hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across campus.
The next step, you know, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider setting an alarm for bedtime as well as when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: the blood goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's side were aiming for their first home win since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, which left his side eight points behind by Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a low-inspired Rangers lineup never gave the impression that he was drawing.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And it could have been a lot worse for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to treat a head wound after he allegedly threw an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same Livingston 11 who scored a point against the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organised side had suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's short first-round pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goalkeeper, but the midfielder missed this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game on the offensive.
No doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt they should have pitched a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the gate in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head-off and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blooded to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard played at break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to the Morelos, but the punter Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty for getting involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counted... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals".
Evans: "Say, I'm sure it's going to pop right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab.
They can see a protein common to various cancers and inject it back into them.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of various cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "training" them to address cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech by wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was taped in the studio after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town ("Ghost Town"), in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?'
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded West's criticism images to social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
Furthermore, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They passed me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was going to be pissed", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see me kick myself?" and said, "I'm going to wear my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love".
His comments caused a stir in the audience at least twice and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole studio was left in absolute silence".
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with an interpretation of the song I love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier water.
West gained the support of TPUSA's conservative leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest minds: Thank you for standing up to the Mafia".
However, a talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful".
"So anyway, I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The DA's office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks the toxic masculinity of the male
Kit Harington is best known for his sword handling role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of a male hero, saying that those roles on screen mean it seems that young people often have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. What are we wrong with masculinity in?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that certain part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because clearly something went wrong with the boys".
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so in a way, it provided me with my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health officials said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual growth, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to mediation for HIV as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican Senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican Party senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by "ultra-right" websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies", Waters commented in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and disclosed information from a member of Waters staff, Capitol Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leakage of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement immediately drew online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was made with anger", wrote Fleischer.
"He's obviously not in the mood to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, you shouldn't be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
It must remain pleasant and serene".
It seemed Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to criticism from Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"I'd be stronger if it was true", he shared on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his department has alerted "law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the culprits are discovered", he continued, "as well as that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my team".
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again, the powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British perspective and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the Johnny English parody and action comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn (Johnny English Returns).
Will this become the ironic satire about the obviously stupid issue of who we are in the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent, leap-eyed, rubber-faced character renewed his license to ruin things for the second time.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamour, has a little Clouseau, a Mr. Bean whistle and a piece of that sort that contributed a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he sowed chaos at his passing.
There's a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last performance.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor steps make a brief roar against his hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" movies, like 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy in a compelling way as one of their ingredients.
It seems like the humor is aimed at children rather than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or focused as Atkinson's silent film jokes about playing the character of Bean.
Now the argument that's always on the table is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates Britain's network of top-secret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, much to the chagrin of the agent on duty, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the height of a pompous and conflicted prime minister who's already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
His intelligence advisers have informed him that since all active spies have committed, he must pull someone out of retirement.
And that's about incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but teaches off-the-job classes about how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and she meets her long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin from Her Majesty's Secret Service misdeeds return to action, encountering the beautiful femme fatale of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is succumbing dangerously to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falcatruadas: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally puts them aboard the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Obviously, all the arrests come from this last sequence, but in the kind and outrageous way that it is, it seems to come from a children's TV show.
The result is fairly regular.
And, as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make Britons work four days a week, but they're charging five.
Presumably, the party wants employers to pass on the savings they've made through the AI revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The trade union congress supported the four-day weekly strike as a measure to help workers take advantage of the changing economy.
A leading Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
And yet, the Labour Party is not currently fully supportive of ambition.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply the possibility that current water company shareholders may not get their full investment back, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of private sector companies' shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the department's findings could influence the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, in an interview broadcast, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the hearing.
I called after the indictment came out and asked if he had.
It was firm, determined, resounding".
However, Graham's vote seems to be unshakable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive starboard set and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people marching to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending public had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the success rate Global Citizen achieved 12 years after achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of the so-called "cluttivism", people who think they make a difference by signing a petition online or by tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion set to influence the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its stock, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or paid off.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and executive society committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", with a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long, hard road, and sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But just like the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that preceded us, we will, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out a "blockade" to hinder Russia's energy exports, the US Secretary of Interior announced.
"If necessary", Washington can turn to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy the way they did in Eastern Europe", he said, reportedly.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the means and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, along with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice, they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to harness and replace fuels", he said, while referring to Russia as having "only one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements came as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set up to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only justified on economic grounds and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position drew the reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and the Berlin-Moscow bilateral agreements.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider her candidacy for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider her candidacy for president after midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the fractured government and that includes a woman in power", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully examine my candidacy for president".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public meeting, stating that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator would not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported that candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what is happening again, I can see myself reflected in other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "come back different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the military, have offered to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a court appeal against a new U.S. policy that grants asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defies politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Sessions v. Grace suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Stop her in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be submitted in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the application, and this prohibition violates that principle", the court's report explained.
Taxpayers continued to debate in the report that policies that deny immigration damage the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions stated in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuous and strong backlashes.
His eyes filled with tears as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shaken the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in town.
"I listened to my wife crying for help and then just silent.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of abusing "propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper preaching the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to the payroll supplement China Daily in Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked what officials in the country have dubbed Reuters as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witnessing the leveling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China's countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of China's top exporters of agricultural products, claimed that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion piece written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of Moines Register, it was revealed that China "is intensifying that campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper post at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the steady thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he adds.
He also claims that "one of China's leading newspapers declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh's disaster makes her lose the Republican vote a few days after the midterm elections.
While many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions to these accusations were numerous and most Republicans took a stand to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be unraveled", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, reflected on Friday in the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, opponents of the "November's Flu Comes!" riot marched through the Senate lobby, while Republicans, with the Judiciary Committee's control, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will surpass any expectation", Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"It's true that it's already high,
But it's still going strong, especially among the undecided women voters in the suburbs or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, don't usually go to the polls".
Before Ford's public witness detailed his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a violent backlash could be expected if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week on NBC News.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench or not, the problem is how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's testimony, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of people surveyed believe Ford's testimony entirely or likely, versus 35 percent who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
Furthermore, 38% believe Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same of Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez, on the other hand, claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a college party when she was a Yale student in the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this tech legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ventured out that the intent of Inrupt's crackdown is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data warehouse" or POD.
They may include contact lists, lists of pending tasks, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
All of this makes this personal data warehouse unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to its president John Bruce, is for the company to bring the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security firm owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
"We don't need your permission".
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide business energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new age of the web", added Berners-Lee.
A tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous honour in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was assassinated by a sniper four days later without even knowing he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial in his honour at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's grandfather's grave that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a thick fog and under the yoke of intense machine gun fire".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "great courage", led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without help from anyone, and shooting down three men from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never live with, but a lesson still".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people".
Peppa Pig is cutting the roll for MMA fans at the best of times
Imagine you're up all night enjoying the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes, something cool stops you.
The San Jose poster included 13 fights, including six main ones, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to meet each other, UK viewers were stunned when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after spending so many smart hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these childish drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke".
"State regulations state that content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and so it had to be changed to children's programming", explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, has stated that they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition", Coker said.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't fix it until Sunday, which is already Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change happened, I started receiving a lot of messages, and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
It's going to hurt us a lot".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that made him find the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he was in high school.
A guest on the first broadcast of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began speaking out about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley shared that he felt " inferior " to the rest of the people because "it was socially unacceptable that you liked boys and girls".
He also said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what has driven me and given me the strength to succeed".
I wanted to prove that I was "someone" so people wouldn't be disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, she became a prominent LGBT activist and used her appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She decided to speak because she felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and she wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was a complete surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20-year gap between them was never a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at just 14 years old, she first participated in the Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find anyone your age who'd experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal", he says.
"But now I know that there are things far more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that she was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son to do was get tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to take that front row", Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that he was not really invincible", she adds.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew at that moment that this was my life's dream: to jump in front of a crowd in my country competing in the Olympics, there was no better feeling", she confirms.
Heather Small's Proud song selection is also not in vain, as it is the tune that accompanied her during her Olympic preparation and still puts her hair on the cutting edge.

A low-form Mickelson ended up on the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who is taking part in the biennial event for the 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk's decision and was unable to participate in Saturday's fourball or foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his moves.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the height of his career, at 48 he did not fit in the well-adjusted Le Golf National course, where the high grass often punishes the wrong shots.
And if that wasn't enough, Mickelson is facing off in Sunday's ninth match against the right-hander, British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joins Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start off well, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted her man, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role I was playing today, slapped me on the shoulder, held my arm and told me I would be ready tomorrow", Furyk shared.
"He trusted himself completely.
He's got a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end, that's the way it is, and that's the way we thought it should be.
Like everybody else, he wants to be out there".
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
He could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, a career that never reached his individual record level.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time losses, although Furyk claims his presence also provides the team with inestimable value.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, genius person and likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I like to see the good things younger players have done with him this week.
It's much more with a good player".
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the advantage will disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an uncomfortable trip.
The Great Danes made their debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal lead winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a big advantage at Valderrama; just like at Brookline, where we lost, but at Valderrama we won by little", reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
We'll have to go for all of them tomorrow.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This isn't over until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I'm not going to get tired of saying that, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world".
Enchanted by his players' performance on a hard-fought golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before the time.
Tomorrow we will face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and then we have to prove ourselves.
It's great to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you face things individually, then you're putting your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also make the best of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek out his players to have better individual performance than his teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last-day laps, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as the loser after the European miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every one of the damn words", he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players on the final day.
"We've got 12 big games, but you'd like to get off to a fast start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there's a lot of pressure in those middle-parties.
We've prepared our lineup with that in mind and we've put the players as we see fit, we want to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
"I decided on this order because I think it covers the whole road", Bjorn explained about his selection for the singles.
The new German warship postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class flamboyant frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to have been commissioned into the Marina in 2014, but problems following delivery affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuing delays mean that warships with the latest technology, which will allow Germany to project its power overseas, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media reported "critical software and hardware defects" that prevented the warship from being used in combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the staff needed on the old Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached the staggering 3.100 billion euros, compared with the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems of the newer frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is rising.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Marina is running out of ships fit to deploy.
The officer claims this problem is growing, as old ships have been retired, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
A new study that's being conducted on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is intended to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe Gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the bats' activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of the sound performed by experts from all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
Next, a habitat map will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
Air generators and hookers also pose a risk, as do fly glue traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, child inspections and, in some cases, even rescue operations.
The organisation even has Scotland's only and first bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, claims this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a large bat area", he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees, and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
It stresses the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternity baby could kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them, as well as to destroy their young.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There is still much to learn about bats, and in the case of many species, we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo has denied the rape charges and his lawyers are preparing to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to make themselves known by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
The footballer allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after its publication, 33-year-old Ronaldo cut this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, no, and a thousand times not.
What was said today is false", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"People want to make themselves known by my name.
It's normal, you know.
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy and respectable man", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they describe as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annually, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down saying he was 99 percent a knight, but that that 1 percent had betrayed him.
The documents say Ronaldo confirms that both had sexual relations agreed upon by both parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was terrified of reprisals and worried about public mockery.
The 34-year-old woman says she's looking to revoke the deal while she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he was signed by Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: carmakers would leave the UK
The UK would regret forever losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had claimed on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It is necessary to reach an agreement", Clark added.
The Japanese automaker has said that if Brexit does not reach any agreement, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced around 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of carmakers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is highly streamlined, with customized automotive parts coming in every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of parts could result.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be stopped.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid such border checks".
"It's essential to have a deal. And we want it to be the best deal, so that we can enjoy the success we have now but also make the most of this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains".
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and Unite union coordinator, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again
The White House has said that the high-stakes meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein could be delayed by another week due to the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Russian aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday, was announced.
Trump stated that he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of inappropriate sexual conduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh by the FBI, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied, "There's no set date yet, it could be this week or it could be a week later given everything that's going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed".
Some journalists questioned that claim, as Sanders has not held a press conference since September 10.
When host Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of briefing was not due to a dislike of the reporters' grandiloquence, although she added that she would not deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president", he said, though he did not cite any sources to back up those data.
Information meetings will continue, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than asking him questions.
You're witnesses of how we've been doing this for the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes bizarre appearance before the press.
A letter from the Secretary of Health to calm the spirits of Brexit
The Health Secretary has sent a letter to EU workers at Scotland's NHS expressing their country's gratitude and expressing their wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of turmoil for everyone.
I therefore want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners in the European Union and beyond bring undeniable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us".
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery following a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's loss (31-27) to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
Apparently, he passed out on the line.
Trainer and medical staff gave him oxygen in the band line before taking him to his stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State coach informed Chris Harris, a reporter at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are no details yet of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total appearances on Saturday before leaving the match, bringing his season totals to 18.
A stamp duty will apply to foreign buyers who buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The raise in the stamp duty will apply to tax-free individuals and businesses in the UK, and the money raised will support the government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases, can be up to 3%.
The business expects the change to reach up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is marketed by non-residents in the UK, which is causing prices to rise and making it harder for people who want to buy a home for the first time to access the housing market.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in estate tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the big homebuilders of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to remove the tax revenue percentages on moderate-priced homes to settle the "housing shame" that is being experienced in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rental controls and a ban on challenges where the tenant is not to blame.
He also wants to give municipalities greater powers in building new homes.
Mrs May stated: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And that's what we need to do to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those people who do not live in the UK as it is for foreign-based businesses to buy housing than for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real".
Jack Ross: My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North West club, which currently sits third in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B team, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father as a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager claims he felt no anxiety about succeeding such established figures at such a big club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will my success at this moment depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club", he said.
"It won't be an easy task to get to, but I'll probably only consider that I've achieved success here if I can get the club back to the Premier".
Ross has only been coaching for three years after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts technical staff.
During that period he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and managed to get St Mirren from the bottom of the table to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a royal crossroads", he recalled, about taking over the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more so than playing.
Sounds weird because I didn't do badly, I made a reasonably good living and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to get over every week.
I still suffer from the stress and the pressure of work, but I like to train.
I've always enjoyed training, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life".

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a drink is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced 2.7 percent growth during July, but consumption in restaurants fell 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, member of the CGA trade advisory board, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The slippery days and England's longer-waited stay at the World Cup caused a similar pattern to June in July, in which pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars specializing in beverages were the ones that achieved the best results with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent".
Paul Newman, employee of leisure and hospitality analytics firm RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since late April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in the consumption relationship outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if added to this the continuing increase in costs.
The warm, long summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant business and time will tell whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide much needed respite for the sector".
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of over £9bn and is considered the benchmark for the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages.
This news has led to an increased fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts (referring to the social media photo sharing network Instagram).
This news has raised a growing fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked to be "rape".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from his membership of the board", Beattie said.
Doyle stated: "I am very much looking forward to being a spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine whether or not I could recover and to what extent.
It was a grueling job, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your encouraging messages".
An advertisement from a breast milk extractor comparing women with cows divides public opinion on social media
A breast milk company has divided public opinion on social media with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To announce the launch of the world's first portable silent breast milk extractor, Elvie released an ironic music video-style ad to demonstrate the freedom the new breast milk extractor offers mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows to the beat of a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I'm singing to myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not beef, they're my breasts".
The chorus continues, "Mush, mush, I'm feeding the babies, mush, mush, I'm kissing my friends".
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on social media.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom said it exposes the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in this case we steal their babies days after giving birth", one wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal suction (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't they be used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who are still with their babies?"
Another viewer added, "What a little tactful announcement".
Other viewers defended the ad, including a woman who said she found the song "very funny".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
Removing my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little silly, but I interpret it as a joke.
It seems like a great product to me", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who are taking their milk (often at work or in bathrooms) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal suction, which gives women freedom to move, suction their babies and even go out while they're sucking their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and chief creative officer of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time the extractor Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children marched on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased despite the monthly number of border crossings remaining relatively unchanged, in part due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it difficult to assign foster parents to children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid of jeopardizing their ability to remain in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential stepparents and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are parents or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
We will therefore continue to pursue these individuals", Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court before a month has passed since their arrest instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the asylum workers.
Many will appear via video instead of in person to try to legalize their case before an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent kidnappings or attempted escape, according to refugee workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers said that these fears increase in larger centers like Tornillo's, where there is a greater chance that the symptoms of a child's suffering will go unnoticed because of their size.
They also added that moving children to the campsite without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupation forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the right conditions were being provided for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib allowed political talks to continue.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, which has three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear boundary dates" and expressed hope that military actions targeted jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for ensuring the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the body's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why is Trump going to win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be expecting, impeachment and scandals put an early end to his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency".
At this time, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers on the nights of major news events.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, show runner for ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? I asked him.
"He replied, 'Because you make me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment within chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it involves more than just being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a brazen outfit", the Washington Post reported) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' gruesome descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'm not going to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night", said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and the daily spin-offs of Trump's show (the conflict with the NFL, the praises to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside on the northern coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while I was recording CNN.
He couldn't untie while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's future hanging by a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but they were right".

Foreign money goes to great lengths to fund the House nominations for the midterm elections.
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving a large cash flow due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two incumbents running for office.
This recently reorganized Pittsburg suburban district is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won another district seat in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlaid on the new 17th District.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the former district electoral district in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th Congressional District triggered a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee of the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after achieving a landslide victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, which enjoyed a wide following.
That position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing Salvador for his support of China and then backed down.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners threw him on the Trump Organization executive team.
State Department officials decided to order the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama back "for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately US$140 million in aid during 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid, was contested.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed holding a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being imposed on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the administration's importance, diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about internal deliberations whenever and wherever the participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was maintained.
Studying history
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice case, which currently has ample evidence in the public record.
Reportedly, Mr. Mueller is also leading his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They're a lot of unknowns, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of killing that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are facing several of these turning points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to his neck ever since this paper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording to the president and speculated that he was incapable of the job.
Mr. Rosenstein has declared that the information in The Times is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that the FBI has just requested of Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or impartial or if his nomination to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the vicious accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibilities from Mr. Trump?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we're not going to fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was the embassy's home.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Rangers player Graham Dorrans is showing optimism in the run up to Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal this month, would place them in a very favourable position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game believing we could achieve something positive and we scored a point.
We had a chance to win in the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
Next Thursday is going to be another big European night.
We hope to get all three points, but it's going to be hard, because they did a good job in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to get a positive result.
Last year was tough, with all the injuries and changes in the team, but there's a great environment right now.
The team's good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to fight, forget about the past season and succeed".
Women worry about savings for retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be treated, few people spoke to their families about the matter.
About half of participants in this Nationwide study said they discussed with their partners the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance division.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to decide where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal papers: Avoid legal battles.
Get a healthcare representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notary's office to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down that information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who are looking after him?" asked Martin.
"What medication are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
He sets a plan".

Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (British Summer Time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to rise.
Due to the communications cut, rescue teams were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area located north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Below we provide you with some key information about Palu and Donggala on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency located along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Celebes Island.
This regency, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire with high seismic activity, so it suffers from earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, that occurred on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is being arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a Wasilla, Alaska native, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the filing of a domestic violence complaint and resisting authority, according to a statement released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, they took her phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, since then" when questioned, the jail reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could go to jail for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing the filing of a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in drunken state in connection with the incident.
His fiancée accused him of stabbing him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome she suffers from after serving in the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people are reported to have died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to rise over the course of the days.
The earthquake occurred just outside Celebes Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They're circulating videos on social media showing the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking to impose a rarely applied death penalty on the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
New York state prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a penalty that hasn't been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, saving the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious injury "intentionally", according to the notice of intent to file a death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the indictment said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the Southern District of New York hasn't processed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the prosecution.
He also requested to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of murder.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Tory MP claims that Nigel FARAGE should be put at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilize an army of people today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party has stated that politicians should feel pressure from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should take over negotiations with the EU).
MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left the EU already if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces to reconcile her party's divided ranks was made evident by the Tories joining the EU in an independent Brexit protest held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her commitments to her Chequers plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continued to struggle to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr Bone stated at the Solihull Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been expected to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been appointed, we would be out of the EU at this time", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to support Brexit, but we must abort Chequers' plan".
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated: "We do not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
The Tory and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, from which she told reporters: "All I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers' plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who take the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel Chequers' plan and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians must be made to feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is currently a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray the Brexit decision and we're here today to tell them we won't let them go out with theirs.
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they suffered in a party app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the best IT systems and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's an absolute hoax.
The concept of a good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall meeting in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She's been the focus of speculation that places her as Trump's successor in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the council format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our government's problems, and for that to happen, a woman fails to hold the presidency.
An arrest has been made in connection with the fatal shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday asking for help identifying a man who was coming out of the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 batting average who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who started from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into the boxes first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, which would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped at the boxing one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the inside at risk of being left behind after a double defensive maneuver at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of the grid and climbed back to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for much of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to get faster in the final part and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the boxes on lap 44 but could not advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a true knight.
The team did an extraordinary job of getting the first two places, Hamilton said.
An unsuitable body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act Saturday for insisting that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at a ceremony in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate was showing that the people were miserable, repugnant and liars.
The only thing that could have happened and the most beautiful thing that's been happening these past few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying, said.
When you see these posts and leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't go.
I didn't go".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you made any leaks?
Remember their answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't go.
Wait a second.
Did we filter it? No., he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not filter her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to keep his confidentiality and I did what he asked me to.
But their denial didn't seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night event: "I tell you body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They're evil and disgusting, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control, the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired their Friday Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early lead by two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to secure the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to come back to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the remainder of the previous three wins coming against the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later from Beauvillier after an assist from David Rutherford.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan re-entered the home team in the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the goal of the tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead of the score before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again tied the game with a power play goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the first game of the second half and secure the victory by their team's fifth goal in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on an airplane can escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero after his death to make sure a plane carrying hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the shells of the city of Palu.
Although his coworkers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position at the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu which was violently swaying.
He stayed in his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Blow us our hearts as we entertain", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the shells and many of them could not be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year from earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing person after a plane crash in a pond
The airline operating a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one person is missing after previously claiming that all 47 passengers and crew left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the pond before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane went far past the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered at a very low altitude.
"That's an extremely positive thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to move between the water reaching their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were grunting and scared, and that he suffered a slight head wound.
The United States Navy reported that sailors working nearby on the improvement of a pier also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors have been referred to the evidence on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, he described to the jury how he used the records from a cell phone to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that she had received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed Tellis was meeting Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his previous claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took to the road on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor's office asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he testified that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers since she was about two weeks old when she died.
The cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"A whirlwind of your life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final proceedings on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be heard by the jury for judgment on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, claims hip hop has moved away from its origins with political and social-struggle messages.
They want to get back to their roots and get combat hip hop back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York childcare provider sues a couple after a "racist" message
A New York child-care provider is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an unsolicited message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her anguish when she discovered that childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOON, another black woman", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
Realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the recently departed caregiver, who was African American, had done her job poorly and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post ad.
Mrs. Maurice paid her for the day's work and sent her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for a severance payment and demand compensation of $350 a day for six months of in-house work for those she was initially hired to even though there was no middle contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen", he told the Post on Friday, adding later, "It's a case of discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations of racism by saying that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent him a message that she had no intention of sending.
He's not racist.
We are not racists", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on in!"
After comparing the claim to "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just given birth to a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going for a person like that?
That's not very ethical", the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear as one might conclude in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to get into the skin of a person who first reads it before it's published.
It's really fun to know now what we know about Paddington's huge success".
After stating that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bitter" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was quietly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous", he declared.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something: you're proud even if you didn't fix it yourself.
I think he felt Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave all credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to tell me that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly being consumed and leaving her body.
It had died a long time ago and now it was going out.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold out".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in this moment of grief over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not realizing the ordeal she was suffering.
"No one detected it", he said.
"I was down and I was always in a bad mood.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her".
Postcards from distressed women to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel like I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile illuminated every room".
However, he left his job before he died and was "in a deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented: "I have continued concern that there may be a side effect".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people to go to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk".
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day was a long one (when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything)".
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "It tore the family apart.
Let's get out of here.
But we have to move forward and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that, if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited time and scope investigation), we might be able to get some unity", Mr Flake commented on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "flattering" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to a question of time.
Five weeks before the midterm elections (November 6) if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush was calling on senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI pulls out your report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is falling under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean deserters heading to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un's rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs on people who are responsible for passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the largest border stretch with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them compulsorily.
Relations between the North and the South (which are technically still at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
That same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they roughly agreed to work to eliminate nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we will disarm unilaterally first", Mr. Ri declared in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he's not fit to go to the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and assured him that he was not fit by nature to enter the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would call her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost barking and talking as he described his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputational assassination" organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed Kavanaugh's statement showed that she could not access the Supreme Court because it showed that she had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you're not fit to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court you're in now", Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible resolutions Kavanaugh might pass against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to go to court and wait for us to say, look at that!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can't drive it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she cried when she got angry, but who developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry".
And then, he kept going.
He seemed brilliant".
The buzzing is allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they're essentially misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my early jobs in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry with an indescribable rage, was that an older woman grabbed me from behind my neck, a distant superior who always gave me a slight scare, and led me to the stairwell.
"Never let anyone see you crying", she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and that they'll comfort you if they come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
"It was not a well thought out decision", he said with laughter 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was advanced, he was delayed in raising funds, so he vowed not to run for president unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters donated $1,000 to male candidates and would only give her $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not run a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions (thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and anger at the existing sexism) that left her speechless.
"You'd think she had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Did you cry?"
How can a trade war between the United States and China for Beijing be positive?
The initial bombing of the US-China trade war was alarming, and while the war is far from over, a distance between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs that hit the equivalent of $200 billion, recording half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way, most recently raising tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion in American products.
China has promised to emulate the US measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will be shut down in the near term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but to publicly double down to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centered researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now being set for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for any help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located on the outskirts of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat for the United States in European territory and the longest Ryder Cup win in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle offered during the tournament, sent the ball to water in the 16th hole of par 3, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has excelled in all his series, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the European team's worst-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups contested, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with the most victories of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm glad I could help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles match.
"It's incredible how proud I am today that I was able to beat Tiger Woods.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 majors, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to stay off the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk declared after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put the Europeans in trouble.
We fought.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior".
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the committee, increasingly uneven conditions of growth are being observed in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km of coastline from Pinellas County north to Lee County south.
Concentrations can be found as far away as 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboroug County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide was also found in Pasco County.
There were reports of mid-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, bottom and high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, bottom and high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, bottom and medium-level concentrations in Charlotte County, bottom and high concentrations on or off the coast with Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation are reported to continue.
No such case has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
