In an emergency call, the professor acknowledged he shot his girlfriend.
During calling the emergency line with a tremendous voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come home to them.
Lamb decided that his "sweet dog" was living in the house and probably annoyed, and that contacts to the family of the dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could get it back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter, which, according to the authorities, signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where the police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
Lamb said he made a fate phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting in the school forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to find what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by investigators on the state side and students and staff who knew him, together created the picture of a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no records in the criminal register or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, in gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with 17 other faculty members and many students went to courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations with regard to problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shocked, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously requested the Delta State University for a vacation for health reasons, when he said he had some kind of problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn’t know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “Mr. Lamba seemed to have troubled something.”
The Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, the police captured his trace when he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself by a single shot of a gun at the courtyard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville in Mississippi, Washington state coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
The car started on the street.
It was unclear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb has grown up in this area.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and lessons of education.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamba’s long-standing friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20, when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends at high school and he was the great older boy who taught her to play guitar for several years.
It was a lot of heartbeat at that time.
The hearts of all the girls fell as soon as they appeared,” says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss allegedly walked together for some time.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of the wedding never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a roof house, which is neighboring the arm of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
“It was completely broken,” O’Steen said about his daughter.
She was my mother’s best friend.
O'Steen said he did not meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when they, along with Abigail, stooped at the summer festival three years ago.
Later they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and occasional entertainment coordinator in The Julep Room, a well-lighted bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss in the night of September 5, the sweat that Lamb played on guitar and harmony for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
“It was just a happy couple,” he said.
We laughed and recorded each other for a joke.
They both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, conducted a seminar in the first year and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of the boy student club and the student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students and community members, took part in a memorial event with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in the vigilia, during which the university body played "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school began again on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis presented a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call to the emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children’s toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in shops and distribution centers across the country, a decrease compared to 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company announces that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and employees will recruit during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are months far away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily receive employees for help in the stores and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is talking about his 'dating' with Princess Diana
"Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was great for personal reasons as well.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that there will be Princess Diana," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The movie begins and I get at the reach of something that could be called a false date with a princess of Wales.
“Return in Time” is a documentary about “Return in the Future,” which contains interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of “Return to the Future” was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s indeed for me the best travel documentary ever filmed.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Secretary says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russian accelerated military support for Syria is that there is no "military solution" to the conflict of five years of conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN head again urged all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution.
Ban said on a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the edge of the general assembly's ministerial meeting at the end of this month for discussing the situation in Syria.
He expressed his regret of the fact that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unresolved."
The Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity they showed in achieving an Iranian nuclear deal to resolve the Syrian crisis.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes opinions.
The others over their hands were like over the unbeaten joke.
And some are preparing for the impairment.
But whether some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they fail to do it (for now).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the leadership of a two-digit number, and some people begin seriously asking what it means for the nomination chances of this magnat from the real estate.
It is still the beginning of the election cycle.
No one of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time of 2011 the leadership of Rick Perry made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end, no one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are a lot of reasons why he might be confronted in general elections.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth realize Trump’s will to survive and begin to put their dollars down to throw it down.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate magnate is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s positive rating turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University voting showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
It was 40 percent in mid-July.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of ten people say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers remain in the initial stages.
After a Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “pleasant” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "angry" with his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unpleasant" or "disrupted" if Jeb Bush's favourite becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticized for his stupidity and insult, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to the idea that the real estate has the right temperament for the post of president, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number is held in the Iowa State Senator Club, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think they don’t have a personality to serve effectively, and 6 out of 10 independent people say that their temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to this.
When they put their academic hat, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is a change from late July when four out of 10 put their money on Jeba Bush.
The GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
This time in the previous cycle, 4 of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mit Romney.
However, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scientists emphasize that the broken field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump’s support is diffusly spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey from early September shows that in the hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always get majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marc Ruby with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christi with 33 points each.
He is in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to be defeated.
Ben Carson would lead over the trader with a wide 19 points in the hypothetical match one against one.
A large majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have already made their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they will no longer change their opinion.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say he will never change his opinion.
46 percent say they leave the back door open for change among candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his external colleague neurochirurg Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would go twice more likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans are allegedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violents” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration is still holding the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.
Some are concerned that Trump’s wickedness will remove key Spanish voters from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new Monday public opinion survey ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim that they agree with Trump in immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the light of reflectors, Donald Trump will also remain.
The government’s frustration has reached a new maximum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now receiving approximately half of the Republican voters’ support, mainly due to their status of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday ABC/Post vote said they would rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry on Washington.
The voting of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "unpleasant" and 21 percent "deeply angry."
The parliament supported a greater share of the country’s coal taxes.
The Czech Republic will earn more than 400 million.
The House of Representatives in the first reading supported the government's amendment to the top law, which regulates the amount of the revenue of the surface mining charges of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised parliamentarians that thanks to this they will get extra money both the state cash and the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticized by opposition members, who are concerned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House in the first reading supported the government's amendment to the top law, which, among other things, means that the state should receive a greater part of the output of the surface mining fees of brown coal from mining companies.
The share of the state will rise to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for the minerals that the companies extract.
The change in the mining fees is expected to bring to the state treasury 427 million SEK more than in 2013.
The government is expected to have a neutral impact on the income of the municipalities, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million kronor from fees and the state budget 150 million kronor.
From the mining of brown coal, the municipalities went about 200 million kronor and the state 66 million kronor.
The Novela also expects an increase in the remuneration from the conquest spaces with permitted mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments will continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told parliamentarians that the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million crowns a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The reimbursement shall be newly calculated as the sum of the amount of minerals extracted and the rate for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is among other things the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS deputy Marek Benda, however, warned that the imposition of the fee by government order may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister Mládka, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is paying the mines that are state property.
Taxes shall be paid only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of profound coal mining, three-quarters of the money of the municipality and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will be in the case of the mining of radioactive mines.
The part of the money that the state will pick on the mining fees will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to the repair of damage after mining or to provide the bank rescue service.
The proposal was criticized by opposition members, who claimed that it would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsore the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunel one of the poorest regions just for the minister of finance to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Usteck region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mostecka, KSČM deputy Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická failed to propose the novel to be rejected, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to the process.
The reasoning report states that according to mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are over 90 percent long-term agreed.
Therefore, main consumers such as power plants or thermal plants should not feel price growth.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate the increase in payments by attempting to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government acknowledges.
According to the report, increases in employment fees are unbearable.
According to the reporter to the Milan Urban (CSSD), it is crucial that parliamentarians know the conclusions on the updated energy concept before the bill is approved and, above all, the government's decisions on the limits of coal mining.
If the coal will be exploited beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in the fact that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak army mine should fall until after 2020.
The limits on the CSA mine should be broken due to social, national and economic reasons as well as due to the long-term stability of domestic energy.
He will lead the Czechs as the one, the implementation will influence the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the table on Thursday's Davis Cup in India and this time each of them will probably enter the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to dissolve the burden over the entire quarter due to the difficult conditions.
In Delhi, the heat and high humidity of the air are dominated, so challenging matches are expected, which can extend up to five sets.
We need to take it into account.
I would like to spread it according to the weather.
And according to how it will look, he said Returned during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Rádža Kumára Khánny.
With the 1st team and the world's 40th, Jiřím Veselým will count to the Friday and Sunday two games.
At the position of the two, it is likely that Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will run.
I want almost everyone to be involved.
I have it slowly in my head, but I’m not going to say it yet, said the captain.
Another assurance in the Czech composition should be Štěpánk's participation in the Saturday fourth game.
The question is who will stand next to an experienced deblist who has a four-game balance of 18:4 in Davis Cup.
It will probably not be happy.
There are possibilities with Rosol or Adam Pavlas.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," he said Back.
It will be determined by the development of the two.
The variant can be Pavlásek, with Veselý surprised in the 1st round with a win in the deble over the Australians.
“He’s a good guy,” he said back.
I’ve done it against Australia, and when I’m playing, I’d like to show the same performance I’ve shown there from the second set.
"I'm glad for those experiences and I would like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The domestic will place Yuki Bhambri (125. in the ATP ranking), who won last week challenger in Shanghai, where he defeated players third and fourth hundred ranking.
Somdev Devvarman (164)
Both are challenger players and our have experience with the ATP Tour, but many times we’ve been convinced that the rankings in the Davis Cup don’t decide.
“It decides the momentary form, the weather,” he said.
Friday starts at 6:30 AM and can be stretched due to the weather.
It is predicted that there will be rain and the court is not under the roof.
This can be done with artificial lighting.
They’ve got it and it has some two thousand luxs, which is enough.
“It should be done under the lights,” he said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
From his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is highly anticipated.
The new job leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and will have to collaborate with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will put the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and the parliament.
In his weekly statement, he called for “fewer theatres and more facts.”
He also said he could jump over several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby’s leadership, which comes after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand in silence during the singing of the national hymn in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a series of conservative MPs and is the center of the attention of several stories on the headlines of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he will "stay in respectful silence" and that he will "recognize the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader to sing the national hymn " regardless of" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, quoted differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "stopping" after Mr. Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's limit of benefits.
Mr. Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit of benefits.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary of Shadow Work and Pensions, said that the party “very clearly” opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade since he was elected as the leader of the conservatives.
The leader of the Labour Party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the crowd" to questions for Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQs are too confrontative and that they will abstain from both “pohot responses” and the upset trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ when he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea that he would let the other colleagues stand for him from time to time, because he heard that he was still discussing the whole matter with parliament spokesman John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to deviate from the "Punch and Judy" style of policy that was often associated with PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the judgment of leaders, their parliament leadership and their attitude among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a cartoon and there is a need for extensive reforms.
"Fotography in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn something and make money to survive.
"I was photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Pound rises while wage growth in the UK accelerates
The pound jumped the following data and showed a recovery of UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led up using the SABMiller offer target.
Between May and June GB profits including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
It was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped by 20% after receiving an approximation of the offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two of the world’s largest beers, and the approach of brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the rival group of luxury goods Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The shares in Glencore rose by 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The stock in the packaging and paper group Mondi was the largest fall on the index and fell 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs dropped his rating to the company to "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company announced a 83% jump in the middle of the year in profits before taxation £46.6m
Head of JD Sports says higher wages could hurt expansion
Executive Chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum wages for workers in the UK could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it’s unlikely that the purchasing power would overcome higher salary costs in his company, he said.
The cost could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague apartment marshmeloun are pleased.
The controversial building got a stop.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the cancellation of the decision illegal and will appeal against it.
Against the building, which is intended to be built near the Anežsky Monastery in the center of Prague, hundreds of people protested in front of the Prague office, and a petition was made.
In the decision, the Magistrate stated that there was a violation of the construction law because all the relevant provisions of the territorial decision were not observed.
"The subject territorial decision does not contain some relevance, for example, the type of land, the distance from the neighboring buildings, sufficiently clearly and clearly described the shape of the building, the definition of the territory affected by the impact of the building," the decision is written in his decision.
The magistrate also considers it illegal that some documents for the decision have been issued to the documentation initially discussed, which has changed.
This is the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is intended to be built on the land of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
According to the documentation, the owner of the land has only confirmed the consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not the consent to the placement of the building on his land, according to the Department of Construction.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta of the investment firm, the Department of Construction Regulations did not take into account the decision of the top authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for the opening of the review has already passed.
In any case, this is a scandal.
“We are preparing this project for 17 years, we respect all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the relevant authorities and institutions,” Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmeloun because of the allegedly proposed color of the facade, triggers strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city to protest the construction.
The associations and the inhabitants of nearby houses are troubled that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that had to look differently.
They also criticize the inappropriate construction for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Anežsky Monastery.
The house was designed by the architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted with a glass facade, was rejected on the basis of the opinion of the National Monument Institute (NPÚ) by the Ministry of Culture and abolished in 2010 the permission of the Prague Monuments.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investimenti with facet shapes but the NPÚ and the magistrate monuments approved and on this basis the building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the excuses of the opponents, said he never counted with the facade in a pink color, which gave the project the surname after a pink-white candy.
The Czech government has caught the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in the bas with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
He took three Syrian refugees in the car along with his crew, who said they wanted to take about half a kilometre.
At that time, he said that it was not criminal yet in Hungary, he said to the People's Newspaper.
We knew that the lawmakers did not affect such acts.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise they arrested us and brought us to the investigative detention in Szeged, the letter described.
The politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police said they behaved correctly, but the communication was linked because they didn’t speak English very well.
He said the prison was sad.
For example, in our cell of about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were pressed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were closed there the next day and because of the language barrier, no one of them knew what was going on with them, Berg said.
What shouldn’t fun anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. will be from 9:30 to answer the questions of the readers answered by the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her about the amendments to the Execution Act in force from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to the Execution, or executives.
Metcash is launching a rural campaign to fight Aldi’s invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash is launching a rural campaign to fight Aldi’s invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand using mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers join brands like the Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream offering tastes in IGA stores and stores owners sell discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware sellers will celebrate their annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot in bet because South and West Australia account for 30 percent of Metcash IGA trading steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern states.
Customers in South and West Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
Anyway, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will reach 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores that took sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week in his report Morgan Stanley analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million on annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million on the individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a solid Metcash price base could cost it around $13 million on income before taxation, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the markets in the Eastern States, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that IGA buyers were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will drop 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund chief manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that business lunch in Melbourne could "very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglass's comment.
But it is known that a member of the Board of Metcash contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and the revenue from the food trade Metcash, which supplies about 1200 IGA retail stores, has declined by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculation change as sales and revenue are under pressure.
However, the wholesale has gone into a counter-attack and invests more than $150 million a year to match the pult prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA retailers re-equipped the stores by adding fast-growing food and news from individuals.
Metcash’s CEO, Ian Morrice, claims that pricing and trade equipment programs will catch down and hopes that the wholesale will return to the basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves glory for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in a recent swing around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, Tennis Australia President Steve Healy said.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," attracted unhappy attention to himself thanks to the affair with the well-known Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in the passionate qualification match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be divided by the judges twice, Harrison then stated: "Wawrinka had one to stretch Kyrgios and I had to stretch him too."
While the last time he was seen to break the missile after his crack hit the possible defeat of Richard Gasquette at the US Open, Kokkinakis indefinitely defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth to place in the second duel after Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
“I thought very intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was slightly trapped into the whole dispute,” Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a cramp in the US, but he is not the first player to be angry on his rocket because of frustration. I know Thanasi quite well and I can say he will not be proud of this event.
But he was seriously controlled very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit hard.
He’s a very adult 19-year-old man, he’s working very hard and the team fits great and so on, he’s never had a problem with other players, he’s very respected in the dressing room, he’s training hard, he’s in amazing condition, he’s a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to ignore Kyrgios because of the important match that starts on Friday, and stated that "middle decision" is the right solution for all, but it supports Canberry's native to return to the team as a long-term stallion.
“First of all, we want our team to be fully focused on the match and not on all the controversy that arose around him,” Healy says.
And I think Nick rose very quickly as Federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public it grows rapidly, he also made a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside the sun, when he will be able to think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for him himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
After announcing the threat state, Hungary on Tuesday closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who tried to illegally cross it in order to stop the flow of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants accumulated in the country of no one and the Serbian authorities reacted angry.
Those who have been caught for an unknown time on the bands of the land between the two states stand those who flee from violence in their homeland, build tents and reside.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter passes over them, migrants call together "Open the borders!" and call the order unit of the Hungarian police.
Some people refuse food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while more and more of them come from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, and not just indirect damage.
In the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries,” says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Rebellions on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the bloc of 28 states failed to come with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprising Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of achieving an eventual agreement next month or by the end of the year that the EU nations would receive more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
The threat state on Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to address the crisis and allowed them to close roads and accelerate judicial cases of asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a roof along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to pass through their country when the roof on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News corepondent Charlie D'Agata that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are pursuing a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize the violation of the four-metre plot that the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establishes longer prison deadlines for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring the state of threat," Prime Minister's spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we are quite clear: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, the parliament still has to approve the military deployment, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters on the border observed a heavy armed army with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s domestic defense adviser, said the authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been arrested on the territory of the state.
They penetrated by damaging the plot and are now in police detention accused of committing crimes under new laws.
The authorities quickly set the plot to be refined.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossing lines with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they used a drag car covered with a rope wire.
The main border crossing near Roszke caused chaos as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metallic container for processing and a pressure of people arose.
About 20 of them entered, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway that connects Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advance over Bernie Sanders decreased by half in national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit advance in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is getting her advance.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (a rise from 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who is to announce whether he wants to become president, is getting the support of 15 percent of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters claim that it is too early to say that there are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost the ground under the legs of several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton keeps a big advance among women and relieves, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has dropped significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points on her.
Clinton’s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has gone out and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit advance over Sanders among the liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points in this group.
About half of democratic primary voters in all states say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
6 percent would not support it.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are inflamed because of her.
The views are mixed among those that currently don’t support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experiences (16 percent), followed by the time to be a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, a large option of choice and consensus on the problems is quoted.
While the Vice-President is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of democratic primary voters would like to face it – a third of them think they shouldn’t be a candidate.
When primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second election for the party's nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton’s supporters, more than half of Bidena stated their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to vote for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden is to 30 points without his nomination.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 percent from last month.
Biden is far second in this scale, but the percentage of people who see it as most likely to be selected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of a candidate, democratic voters prefer problem-solving than greater choices to be elected.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate appears as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Bidena as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think of him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
As for all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as a secretary of state continue, most primary democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the matter and say that this has not affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public it is a different story.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with its explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The opinions of the public on this topic were shared in March, shortly after the problem came out.
Most Americans say that these email controversies have no impact on their overall opinion about Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their opinion about Clinton.
It’s mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claims that their opinion about Clinton has worsened.
Although Clinton is perceived as honourable and trustworthy among the voters of her party, this question remains a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see her as honourable and trustworthy, which is a drop of eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
60 percent of registered voters don’t think they’re honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country don’t see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good signs for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than unfair, but, like Carson, a lot of voters have not made their opinion about him.
The error gap for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for the half of the voters in the latest survey and the others let them seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump with a tremendous majority, rising from 23% of the support in the latest CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson in the same period shot from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is leading well across demographic groups, and discarding Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorino and Ohio Governor John Kasiche, is behind together with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the ease of 10% support fell to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together on the third place with 6%.
The error gap in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of Republican support for Trump’s 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's rising trend, Trump decided to shoot blindly on a neurochirurg in service, and even Carson apologized for an interrogation about Trump's belief.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of the death of a Baruch College first-year student
Nearly two years after a student died during a overloaded brotherhood ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michael" Denga during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police.
Police reports that he had bound eyes, had a bag full of sand of a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly disturbed when he tried to get to the target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng was tired, and allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
However, they found the time to switch Deng's dress, googled out his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the president of the nation's brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and essentially gave preference to the well-being of fraternity over Michael Deng’s life,” Wagner said.
He failed to recover and died the next morning.
According to the pitch report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object in the head, body and stain.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of brotherhood overload and at least one student dies every year because of overload since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, writes in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be responsible and this step is important by the institutions.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County recommended accusations of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with attack by overload and criminal association.
“We want to arrest not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we will take them to responsibility as well,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and national brotherhood abolished its relationship with local branches.
This is the case when the Fed raises interest rates.
Rates will rise and the bear market will clump, bond revenues will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
We know all this.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For economics specifically, the history of a small provider offers timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate rise and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in the rise of rates is often, although not always, determining in how the economy and financial assets will react.
That’s why officials of the U.S. Central Bank have emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rise of rates begins, but rather on the trajectory of how long the normalization will take.
There are more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that any swing due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“Fed’s first increase since the time of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the ‘ cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, the leading global economist in Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more common, but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means there will be adverse effects.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market recorded in the last about a month, the expected rise of rates can make the air a little unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend for re-stop of shares after 12-24 months after the first rise, which again may reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what will happen after the Fed rise.
More precisely, the market in the past about 35 years often the most - about 14 percent - is going to the rise of rates in relatively flat in 250 days (the average rise of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main stock strategist of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares tends to become more significant later in the rate rise cycle and the return begins to decrease.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but increased rates often help it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and which could accelerate the recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history while increasing Fed rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rise of rates since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expect its maintenance, when in the third quarter it was at just 1.5 percent, according to Atlanta Fed.
The rise of rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared for the growth of the Fed throughout the year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% probability.
“In our study since 1950, all the rise cycles have been in the super cycle of rise with GDP covering the heights of the beginning of recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery,” the report says.
On the contrary, this was a clearly slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is far from the longest of those that the Fed expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are on 74 months and we are still on.
The fixed revenue was also volatile as the market expects a rise in rates and the pattern is slightly similar to what the shares experience.
The main difference is that the impact is faster visible in bonds than in shares when the Fed changes the policy direction.
For bonds, the revenue seems to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/down cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond revenues fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Strategists Charles Schwaba believe that the rise of rates will cause the approximation of revenues between long- and short-dated bonds, which will balance the curve.
High-performance bonds often work better in this climate, although “we’re still cautious about revenue tensions,” said Kathy Jones, a firmly fixed pension analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed’s policy.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease of inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy,” she wrote.
The short-term interest rates are up, the revenue curve is broader, the credit gap has expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed stricts the policy.
In general, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win after the rise of interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will succeed worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also be greater.
“History shows that the “quality” of shares tends to overcome within three months after the initial rate rise,” Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a customer report.
Companies with strong balance sheets overcome weak balance sheets in each rise of interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenues, as well as low volatility stocks, also overcome their lower-quality counterparts on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to the purely stock game, consumers also benefit from the growing dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher revenue, but experts have different opinions about how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative deputy Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "deeping"
He believes that he is increasingly undifferent from his commercial opponent.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they simply deceive the British
Deputy colleague Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" in Classic FM, the leading MP claims and accumulates fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove they are doing something that commercial broadcasting does not do.
Conservative deputy Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chiefs that the public service radio station seems to be "deeped" and is becoming increasingly undifferent from its business opponent.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "deeped "- but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are two examples that attack me when you actually just imitate what we already have on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive rejected the charges with the justification that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 would not be learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and creating music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work more hard to engage the audience than before, because the British are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that got under fire because of sliding on the feet of commercial competitors during broadcasting Culture, Media and Sports and got to the commission hearing.
Conservative deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as an unoriginal and not a very different one?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was made "in a way typical for the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stand" when the next time it will start a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude ordering more future series of The Voice or spending the taxpayers’ money on license fees on other formats of entertainment.
Online sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and the fault may be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month was recorded the lowest growth since the record began in 2000.
Online sales were strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for spending breaks
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise and thanks to it, many of the British main streets have become ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs of stable online sales, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August was the lowest growth since the beginning of the measurement in 2000, with a growth of just 5 percent compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of stable online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the level of growth in the past years and go back to 2000, the state has always rationalized over time,” says Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index.
It explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on a sofa.
But now (the growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore it seems to be reacting.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was overtaken from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could stop buying before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average buyers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and shut down several dealer websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers re-contract, can keep customers from further purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the jar in Mecca and the family of Bin Laden was sanctioned
29 dead were transferred to Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia is partially guilty of the collapse of the construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the jewel collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to burial 29 victims of the fall of the jarab in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Clothed to a certain extent in white, the saddened chose their way and gave up respect to the victims when the first of the fallen came on their last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier the building wreck broke the ceiling of the mosque and crushed on the believers.
The body was released for the funeral and the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the building group of the bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people killed in the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first journey when the yellow crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hadge journey.
Saudi officials have already promised that the hadj to Mekka will be held and thousands of people will continue to descend to the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not leave the shoulder to the top when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-operated Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partially guilty of the fall.
The British disc agency service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s chiefs were banned from traveling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the fall of the jarab into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims walked before the Hajj begun later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statements about the collapse of the jar and did not be made available to its representatives for a comment.
The royal decrees also accused the group of failing to use the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of hills surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and operates large construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a rebellion, who was abandoned by the family in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before millions of people in the kingdom got on a journey that must be completed at least once in their lives by every skilled Muslim.
According to officials, 158 people are still hospitalized.
Officials determined that one million riyal (£174,000) will be devoted to the relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanent injured.
The other injuries will receive half of this amount.
Head of B&Q says Eastern European traders working for cheap are already trending them
British people are employing more and more craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of educated traders in Eastern Europe is behind a point of growth
The result is the opening of 200 Screwfix stores focused on traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British says they put off the clothes and brushes and deliver them to employed, trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at home.
If you do it with a stick or a painting brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are employing more and more craftsmen to perform curl work at home, according to the company’s head for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a chain for domestic needs, says that a large increase in the number of educated traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores focused on traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better half.
Nowadays, most workers are male.
She said there is a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more female households that make more household adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says: “We still work mostly men in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of their decisions about purchases of goods.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Mrs. Laury, one of only five women at the headquarters of the UK FTSE100 index, has also restructed her top team to reflect equality between man and woman managers.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in the fact that it has half the female representation among employees including the executive and financial director.
Mrs. Laury says: “It was a conscious decision – diversity is an important topic here.
So it was not difficult to find good women that we would take to us.
Kingfisher announced a decline in both profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
The result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
This year’s €600 to the pensioners is in danger.
“It’s justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice,” said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of meritability.
ODS Deputy Chairman Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard valorization, because it would be reflected in the next years.
“We have space to find the mechanism we will arrange it,” Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was intended to be valued beyond the framework of the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy with the argument that it would improve the social situation of the retirees, which she did not think was pink.
The higher valuation next year would mean the budget impact of SEK 5.5 billion, and ministers are discussing each million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorization has decreased.
Rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing veto of payments in December will make it significantly complicated and impossible, he said.
The CSSD deputy chairman Roman Sklenák therefore proposed a short term for the discussion of the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
The committee will have a month in place of the usual two.
The bonus is expected to reach a total of 1.73 billion kronor.
The money will be made from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions are expected to rise an average of about a hundred crowns.
The pension should be granted to persons who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
Those who lost their right to retirement in December before paying it could also get it.
The payment must be made in writing, not later than the end of the year.
In the Czech Republic, pensions are valued regularly to January, with price growth and a third of real wages growth.
This year the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross wage, and next year it is expected to be 40.5 percent.
According to the state’s final account last year, the state spent 314,7 billion crowns on old age pensions, which was approximately five billion annually more.
The pension expenditure accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all law-obligated expenditure.
The average full age pension last year increased by 104 to 10,714 SEK according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a pay of 2.4 million full age pensions and approximately 17,000 relative pensions.
Jakunin left plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
The seat of the Senate was secure, according to the Russian media.
In the Council of the Federation he had to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov as a candidate for the Government Party of the United Russia defended his post in Sunday elections with a overview.
According to the Russian law, the senators are not elected by citizens, but are elected by a governor from three candidates whose names will be announced before the governor's elections.
After the election, the senator will be selected by the three candidates.
The complication was for Jacob the fact that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by the law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunina with the fact that he is an extraordinary and empowered ambassador, which is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The Czech Comedy Theory of the Tiger.
The last drop in the predestination of the main hero is the voluntary death of his uncle, to which the strength and patience came.
Babička - Iva Janžurova decided about grandfather's life, age and funeral.
Jan is clear that he is on a similar path with his wife Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live dignely and freely again.
He desires to get back the rule over his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the previous one, Slavík told the story.
Bajgar wanted a comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that the main role will be played by Bartoško, with whom he has already collaborated on the Invisible series.
However, the actor, who appeared before the camera after a long break associated with rehabilitation after a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed together three years ago.
I gave him to read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was an outspoken athlete.
Before the filming, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he was cycling, climbing the rocks and even walking to the hill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director said.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to make it a rabbit over time.
They’ll feed him a little, but they’ll immediately close the door so that he doesn’t think of playing out of the rabbit to the tiger.
And we are trying to tell about this our film, the actor commented.
His wife, which can affect the audience slightly negatively, appeared by Eliška Balzer.
She is not just a negative person.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathic and thinks it well.
But at the same time, she is a usurpator and wants to make her husband to die, Bajgar said.
The film parallelly depicts the fate of Jan's married daughters Olinky and Alenka - Tanya Vilhelm and Pavla Beret - and the sons of Erika and Pepíka - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The U.S. Internet company Google has promised to provide an additional $5.5 million (132.6 million CZK) to organizations to help thousands of refugees flowing to Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is the charitable footprint of this internet company.
Azerbaijan has canceled a part of Telić's visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech deputy for the ANO movement Pavel Telička has postponed the scheduled Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have canceled his official part of the visit.
Baku, according to Telička, justifies this by the last week’s European Parliament resolution, which criticizes the human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička was co-author.
The decision of the Azerbaijani party Telička lost the possibility of interviews with official partners and also the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
The route, which was planned a few months in advance, Telička wanted to use to meet with the parliament leadership and executive representatives as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The resolution condemns “unprecedented repression against the civil society in Azerbaijan”.
It urged European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent judgment against the Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadida Ismail, who sat on the discovery of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not exclude the construction of its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky during his visit to Novosibirsk did not exclude that in the future a Russian air base in Syria will be built.
We do not have such plans yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia has a flighted naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which has been used as a service and logistics center.
According to the Russian media, the supply of Russian weapons and military materials to Syria has increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are weapons shipments arising from existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to build an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains the castle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington has not been clear about the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria, the U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, which was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to expose concerns about the gathering of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Moscow’s support for Assad was a losing bet.
The objectives of Russia’s policy in Syria are rather unclear.
Moscow has made its own satellite from Syria.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the other hand, the Russian leader has no intention to talk about the situation in the Donbass.
According to the New York Times, the U.S. government does not exclude that President Barack Obama may meet with the Russian President during the UN meeting.
However, the views of the White House counselors are still different.
TASS today, referring to the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov's words, wrote that Putin has no meeting with Obama on the schedule of his New York stay.
Seasum oil is used in the gallbladder diet, cannabis helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressing from the seeds cold, all healthy substances will remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example, gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, this is the most common cause of death in the Czech Republic for several years.
Glucose inflammation worries mostly women, it helps sezam oil.
If you belong to the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss the sezam oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic meals.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the thermal processing of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the diet.
The essential fatty acids that it contains are a good prevention of the formation of yellow stones.
These are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more frequently than men.
In general, the problems with the gallbladder concern especially people with overweight who do not sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sezam oil can be successfully used even in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should pay attention to the goods from the exotic food stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use pressed seeds that have a stronger taste.
But the oil will lose all the active substances, said Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsk, which produces bio virgin oil pressed for cold.
The company is also producing sezam oil and uses exclusively unprecedented seeds of white sezam.
In an hour, we get 8 pounds of sezam.
Mechanically pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for marking extra virgin.
At higher temperatures there will be loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for heart and blood diseases.
The Czech favourite among the oil is sunflower.
According to a study conducted by Jarmila Hamerské at Masaryk University, 43% of respondents prefer it in a hot kitchen.
However, it is not suitable for fried, and at 180°C it begins to be burned.
It is better to use it, for example, to eat salads and is especially suitable in a diet that helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids most decrease cholesterol levels.
In case of heart problems, you should be careful about the amount of total fat and calories.
For example, in one teaspoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a teaspoon of reef oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of foods, it is important to realize that natural nutrient foods are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to take extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as the sezam and cannabis will last for nine months.
When stored in the refrigerator, the duration will be extended.
The old oil people know especially according to the fierce taste.
On the contrary, there is no defect on the bottom.
This is a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
Cannabis oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical cannabis are among the so-called superfoods, and therefore cannabis oil is considered the healthiest of plant oils.
This is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and one must receive them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while Icelanders receive 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Cannabis oil is advisable to be included in the diet as part of a support diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People need not be afraid of the use of cannabis oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found the way to consumers confirms the fact that in the company Bohemia Oil belongs to the best-selling.
It is sold for 500 liters a year.
People often take one teaspoon in the morning.
Cannabis oil is not taste-specific, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kraslick company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of grillers are Americans.
For one house there is 1.4 grills.
Thro the world there are various competitions in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people in their lives negrilated.
The vast majority then grill several times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the thermal treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for it and will at the same time leave health beneficial substances when grilling?
In general, during the grilling process itself, fat should be saved.
Experts agree that a large portion of the oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from dishes adjusted at lower temperatures.
This does not mean that extra virgin oils do not find their application.
Wine oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When meat is said, experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic on Sokolovsk will immediately equip grape oil.
It has a great taste for meat and fish.
In the kitchen it is characterized by the unique feature of increasing the natural taste of the food.
It is also suitable for fried and grilling, as it has a high burning level, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils preserves the health beneficial substance, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from the company Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil we help to increase our outer beauty – it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and broken hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when cooking salads, but also for the thermal processing of dishes.
During grilling, therefore, it can be used in two ways, when marinating and the grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we maintain their sweetness.
During the preparation of the marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
The acidity is supplied, for example, with apple ointment and we can make meat so soft.
The spices, in turn, add the meat taste and the oil conserve and provide the right rice, advises Daniel Wolček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marination because as one of the few oils it can pass through dark meat.
Married meat or fish are therefore ready for grilling, how do we move forward?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that just a few drops are enough to prepare their dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are a completely tabu for this method of preparation.
This applies especially to linen, cannabis and reef oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before the grill itself, throw the roast with oil, preventing the burning of food.
An essential part of the grilling is also the preparation of the attachments.
For grilled meat and fish, almost anything is suitable - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 cup of brush • 1 cup of rocks • 1 cup of cut corn • 1 cup of salad leaves mixture • 3 teaspoons of grape oil
In the salad meat, add to the mixture of salad leaves drawn rocola, cut corns, and cut broccoli on large cubes.
According to your taste, you can eat chili and soya sauce.
Finally, put a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sweat the salad with gently cut tonsils.
Multiple sclerosis: it doesn’t matter only on medications, but also on the patient’s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an ergotherapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only a therapeutic care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these sick people includes social advice, recommendations when adjusting housing, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can substantially affect the patient himself.
The more he will actively fight the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the sick leaves space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when the sick needs some compensatory aid, for example, a plate.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to the fact that they end on a wheelchair.
This is why the site has been created (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign.
The most important person in the care of a sick with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, it is twice said that the earlier the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not so strong yet.
The earlier we interfere, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and delay the disability, explains Dr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Very important is rehabilitation care for people with multiple sclerosis, which most often addresses weakening of the lower limbs or imbalance disorders.
Patients work according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pancreatic bottom, alleviate digestion disorders or improve coordination.
“It’s really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient,” says Dr. Martina Kövári, primary of the Rehabilitation and Bodybuilding Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis in fact suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
Moving activity, however, also strengthens the body’s immune state, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick people check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
“With exercise endorphins are also floating and a person feels well after it,” says Dr. Kamila Řasová from the Rehabilitation Medical Clinic of the Faculty Hospital of the Royal Vinohrad.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
Directly, we interfere with the psychic and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
“In the past these patients were so-called savings, today we know they need a targeted burden,” says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the head of the Rehabilitation and Bodybuilding Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The purpose of physiotherapy is to ensure that a person can remain self-sufficient as long as possible, including employment.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergoterapists so that each person gets a compensatory aid to him.
Many patients need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people shock it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sick soul we have to go for someone, not to try to catch everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they finally come to the conclusion that even with disability can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malin - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere airbus would not fly.
Air production is synonymous with accuracy and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials that can not be manufactured and processed.
Nevertheless, in addition to super-precision, computer-controlled machinery, in addition to autoclaves for composite forming, you can find something as ordinary as mercury pecks.
In a bubble, which resembles a pot of sugar watt, the edges of the sheet parts that just came out of the freezing machine are melted in a crowd of pecks.
"Nobody has yet come to anything better," Smiles Ivan Dubsky, Chief Executive Officer of the Latecoere air door manufacturer.
In the area in Prague's Letňane, the former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world they deliver the door to the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is set up in Prague, also enters passengers in the first and higher classes on the top-boats of the world’s largest aircraft Airbus A380.
The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner will be built.
Precision is the main motto.
For example, the moment key allows the company to arrange twice a year.
If the yellow label does not have a check record, they should have something to explain in the Prague factory to the Airbus or Boeing auditors who ride regularly to find out if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
Human senses have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
On one door to the A320 there are 1500 nits.
These must be handly scattered.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the falling clay they will know if it is already properly disclosed.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The nit can rise from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the surface of the aircraft.
This is about twice the thickness of human hair.
During the check, a trained touch will come on a series.
When the controller passes through a series of nits, he will find out if any of them is out of tolerance.
After that, he takes into his hands a precise discharge meter.
Flight was fed before 1989 the program of the training military aircraft L-39.
No one was produced in 1991.
The company had to quickly find new contracts.
It was then joined with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the selection procedure for the emergency door supplier for the A321.
The conversations with Boeing were not so happy.
“We were a small company for them at that time, which had not enough money to invest and so that Boeing could guarantee a long-term stable supply,” Dubsky reminds.
The door to the U.S. manufacturer would remain untouched if Letov not attracted the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Aviation Industry Association in 1999.
I talked there about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day the negotiations with the French began, Dubsky says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
In 2000 the A320 was built.
Three years later, the top-board doors for the A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall because of the supplies for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere we’t get ourselves to these big contracts.
Maybe we would make parts or small parts.
The partners want a 20- or 30-year delivery guarantee, Dubsky explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere reached a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after taxation of 147 million kronor.
Exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion SEK in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any door to the aircraft.
Obtaining certificates that manufacturing processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated checks to keep them costs according to Dubsky millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and strict.
We need to train staff, equip equipment and re-certify the whole process, Dubsky says.
Now, the company is completing the preparation of the process for polishing with zinc and nickel, which will replace the previously harmful to human health cadmium.
The tasks were given from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come to check the concept of the entire line.
Then we will show them production.
We will also check our laboratory.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratory and then the results are compared to our, approaching the Dubsky way by which customers check them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts to the Prague company.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embraers stands and falls.
For the A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that he can say any price behind the door.
The price curve is part of the contract.
It shows how many one door will stand after ten, fifty, hundred pieces made.
The price per piece continues to fall to a certain limit value.
We need to get into this price formula.
If not, we will be missing, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabin for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft is completed, is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the wall, there is a new semi-robotic line for nitting and mounting doors for the innovative A320 Neo.
The processing will be accelerated and accurate.
"This is the trend that the installation in the aviation takes," Dubsky adds.
The future line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 new A320.
Just a few meters next will be a line for the complete assembly of the doors for the upper A380 board.
This is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production time and reduce costs.
The full assembly could begin in two years, Dubsky says.
However, before this, the company must pass the qualification tests for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also plays on further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program that will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"For a company, it's a huge credit when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," Dubsky says proudly.
Latecoere, however, is at the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
In the area where he is located, there is no more place.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800 and in three years it could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are overlooking how many hundred new aircraft airlines order each year, they may not be afraid of work.
Although it has contracts for several years in advance, the mother company of Prague Latecoere faced a bankruptcy threat.
The French group didn’t have enough money to pay the loans in September.
Finally, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, the loan was exchanged by shares.
The creditors gained a share of 37.4 percent by increasing their capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt dropped by two-thirds, 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company has registered new shares for 222.9 million euros among the existing shareholders.
It increased its capital by 280 million euros.
At the same time, the entire group profits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which share 85 percent in sales.
The average procurement growth is expected to be 4% per year by 2017.
In the contract book, it has orders for €2.6 billion, which is equivalent to four-year production.
French media says Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the cappucks.
The Czech race in the Prague Summer is important for the groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group’s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Parliamenters supported a greater share of the country’s coal taxes.
The change in the mining fees is expected to bring to the state treasury 427 million SEK more than in 2013.
The government is expected to have a neutral impact on the income of the municipalities, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the previous year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million kronor from fees and the state budget 150 million kronor.
From the mining of brown coal, the municipalities went about 200 million kronor and the state 66 million kronor.
The new regulation also expects an increase in the reimbursement of the acquisition spaces with permitted mining to a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments will continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told parliamentarians that the municipalities will receive 14 million to 100 million crowns a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The reimbursement shall be newly calculated as the sum of the amount of minerals extracted and the rate for the individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is among other things the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
ODS deputy Marek Benda, however, warned that the imposition of the fee by government order may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
According to the Minister Mládka, however, it is not a tax in this case, because the state is paying the mines that are state property.
Taxes shall be paid only to the municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of profound coal mining, three-quarters of the money of the municipality and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same ratio will be in the case of the mining of radioactive mines.
The part of the money that the state will pick on the mining fees will be targeted.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to the repair of damage after mining or to provide the bank rescue service.
The proposal was criticized by opposition members, who claimed that it would damage the municipalities affected by the mining and the counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayor) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsore the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunel one of the poorest regions just for the minister of finance to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Usvit) elected in the Usteck region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mostecka, KSČM deputy Hana Aulická warned.
Kádner and Aulická failed to propose the novel to be rejected, Kučera wanted the law to return to the government to the process.
The reasoning report states that according to mining companies, the increase in charges will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are over 90 percent long-term agreed.
Therefore, main consumers such as power plants or thermal plants should not feel price growth.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate the increase in payments by attempting to reduce their operating costs, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government acknowledges.
According to the report, increases in employment fees are unbearable.
According to the reporter to the Milan Urban (CSSD), it is crucial that parliamentarians know the conclusions on the updated energy concept before the bill is approved and, above all, the government's decisions on the limits of coal mining.
If the coal will be exploited beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in the fact that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak army mine should fall until after 2020.
The limits on the CSA mine should be broken due to social, national and economic reasons as well as due to the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to Decide on Interest Rates for the US Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching the US Federal Reserve is going to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists referred to by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain inactive for a while and keep interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it has passed a few years since the Fed dropped the rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation in which the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero line and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economy.
The U.S. economy went quite well, there was recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low inflation level.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
They warned the markets to be prepared for the rise, but the circumstances indicate that they also see great chances against this step.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 AM.
Shooter at Delta State University Leaves a Message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day and his colleague - wrote a message in which he claims that he is "flight" of his first murder and that he wishes he could take it back, government officials revealed on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi said Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10 a.m.
He said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police to his house.
He said, “Yesterday night I shot my wife,” and he also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “will not bother anyone,” but is annoyed.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb did not present himself.
He did not explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a hand-written message from Lamba in which it stood: “I’m very sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.”
After leaving the message, Lamb went on a 300-mile trip to the University of Delta, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Dean of the University William LaForge said he didn’t know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “in Mr. Lamba’s head obviously something was happening.”
Even despite Monday’s statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss’s romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was “no evidence” about the “love triangle.”
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for more than seven years, said she was "a great person."
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O’Steen and Prentiss has been “touched” by the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "the best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, the close girlfriend of Prentiss, according to Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home through the internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, walked with Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help others,” Knowles told me.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to prison.
When the police reached him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the forest where he shot himself.
According to his biography, published on the school’s website, Lamb won a PhD in Education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has a few stressful years behind.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner Farrah Fawcett due to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and in 2008 he was arrested for drug holding.
All of these things will be taxed.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months away from the game due to a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double break in his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defense left this wound in tears and removed him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Morena's impatient intervention in the 15th minute when the twenty-year-old Shaw penetrated into the PSV space.
He was treated for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg break and is now in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or tomorrow and then further operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 it's very hard, but he's playing fantastic and then it's going to happen this.
When he was in the dressing room, he also had an oxygen mask.
was crying.
I am not a doctor, but a double breakdown of the leg requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will play this season.
Moreno was fortunate that he did not get a red card and a penalty shot.
The Mexican judge Nicola Rizzoli has not been punished.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can evaluate whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a terrible action with both legs.
The Shawa account tweet says: "Thank you all for their messages, the words can't express how destroyed I am, my way to recovery begins now and I'll return even stronger."

The English defense team will have an additional motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It was a very ugly injury."
When any player leaves the field with such a injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a break in his leg during the match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such a injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was unable to perceive this moment.
I only saw the ball moving in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched him, but I didn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad, I am very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's intervention.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
Every parent knows this: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take a long time to learn to remember it.
You should not be David Cameron.
Asked by a child scheme provider to name the favorite child book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a fairy tale by Dr. Seusse from 1971.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on SuperCamps’ website and continues: “Cameless, impressive, creative and with strong content, such I’ve loved to read to my children, because behind it was always a picture or message that I haven’t seen before.”
Well, until then that in the following paragraph Cameron allegedly described the story of the book according to an elevator from the 2012 film that added additional characters and details to fill in the short original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by the walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is the short content of the book that records the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn’t suspicious enough, the text delivered by Cameron is read as the summary elevator of the film Lorax, which is found on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: “In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by the walls, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey.”
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not get acquainted with the story of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the graffitious, trees crawling industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the title Lorax, the scratched, scratched creature, who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely so relatively little significant PR task was received by an assistant who never read Lorax to the child 20 times in a piece.
A spokesman for Downing Street said the text was probably from the office of Cameron’s supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by the employee of Cameron, but without any further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of forgetting England, but still holds
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team England has chosen for this tour, I think the repetition of the 3-0 defeat she suffered last week in the trial series will not be too likely.
I would also not directly exclude the winning of the guests.
The party of Alastair Cooka may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good players spin here in this palm set and also collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the cicatrics of 2012, only youth positive.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth fell out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to ignore Adam Lith is a hard nuts for me to analyze because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests stood against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root there were no questionnaires, which led to the announcement because — and this I’ve already mentioned before — players are their best selectors.
A few more half centuries and Lyth could extend his series, but had control over his own fate.
We hope that when he succeeds to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will come.
England's chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, although his performance was not 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the carpenter gets to show itself is a hard nuts.
Lyth got seven caps — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could remate is that England first gave the chance to Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean—although Lyth was in the best form—but this missed opportunity is already a past.
Alex Hales comes and it’s a puppy, which I appreciate very positively.
It’s the x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season, when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge, which was so a little done.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all this will, of course, depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts on the side of Cook, who would get another extra spinner whileining four quicks, was overtaken and I have no reservations against it.
I don’t understand why the strokemaker can’t shoot off and this left-wing man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his district, Worcestershire, but he was the number 3 for them and there is no big difference in it.
My former team colleague Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his performance in 2001.
Three centuries passed and he didn’t even look.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he attracted me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — an average of 31 with a palm and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a pramici, but there’s not a lot of spinner who would raise their hands, and the selectors chose for youth.
You will learn a lot about this tour.
Beyond the team it seems that England has made several changes and smart supplements to their trainer staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardenea, a basketball player from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for trial matches can be a championship move.
He is one of the most beautiful players who will bring rich experiences by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and immaculate glow.
I always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and just like Mahela, he has an intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the closet, although they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally relieve and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly's co-player Durham Ben Stokes got a one-day vacation, just as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many do not agree, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken at a light weight.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
David Cameron's unthinkable renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets into further problems with every last day even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or Not?" Corbyn to the head of the Workers' Party, or will happen to the TUC take on Tuesday to the parade the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is dying in various crises – not all of which are their fault – some Member States already have enough British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they didn’t want it even if they had a social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolities, take a photo in front of the famous local monument, with or without local staff, and then return home with the words that they win the allies for the reform.
It’s all about me.
My European friend, who wants the unprecedented Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-looking ministers and officials in some cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a cautiously balanced German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as it was with too long continuing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
Francois Hollande is faced with re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also falls.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to see how they break their legs in helping the Selfie British who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan intentionally useless notes of the SNP style during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in the UK to accelerate the Brexit process, a friend says.
“Return negotiations solved the problem” and “British has nothing valuable from negotiations.”
Europeans to their own harm know how wicked Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the press oligarch barons are to the EU because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Bennem in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They may remember the name of Boris Johnson, a jumping Euro-oportunist who made his name as the Brussels reporter "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his jealousy, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free scammers, foreigners hacking phones, and pseudo non-marine departments, which owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but realized that when you’re in a cage with a angry gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so that she doesn’t give you to dinner and then also to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of abolished EU constitution, which was immersed by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and got him a card of expulsion.
The press never forgived him.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly paid me back on Monday in Westminster – I told him that he shouldn’t waste time on me – seems to be at risk of re-accepting Murdoch Neil Kinnock’s boicot strategy, which was a mistake at that time and now.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC left on Sunday.
Corbin’s official attitude towards Europe, I’ll say, is developing.
He says he wants to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the angry tendency of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's small Englanderism can approach it.
The same thing Hilary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn in radio and television this week, when his internal scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought on television for his loyalty, without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary’s match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Bennin's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday evening,
Whether the background is any, sensitive picture that Corbyn wants to disclose - don't forget, he touched me too - the discipline of news remains important in the ages of everyday television broadcasting and especially in faith, a paranoia and betrayal that social media are.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign as obvious, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins is sure.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic discourse about membership in the EU – in accordance with their Bennite surrounding economy, anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic hashtering.
Just as with his crackdown on NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic gentlemen.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – because of British concessions when it seems useless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the brick "low military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, including reducing the cost of the conservative government at power, as I was reminded on Monday's launch of something called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticize the e-mail review published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s statement that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have connections with the tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet’s criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published the “intermediate” report last month and described it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, several researchers questioned the scope of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The introducer in the expert magazine Lancet last month attacked a "extraordinary chatrical base" on which the PHE founded its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have challenged the claim that was allegedly "built on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public could expect that the claims of the PHE agency that sound "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harm associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the talks were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive has allegedly previously received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the Public Health Authority BAT in the Sustainability Report, he says.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting admitted the financing from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing he allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they provide.
The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but they contain several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also in the newspapers declare industrial financing.
Some other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting was also attended by the tobacco leadership.
The report created in this group “accepts” the lack of “hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, no of these links or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claim that “there is no evidence for now that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers,” was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said the claims at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two lifelong smokers dies due to their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks represented by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what they don’t show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people per year die from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs NHS £2 billion per year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfill our national competence.
BBC is expected to end with EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used for programs that are not formed by other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programs that will probably be watched by only a few people, in complex broadcast times compared to its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After generally CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he failed to try to connect with the BBC for six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I'm fighting with the idea that the BBC is giving and broadcasting programs that would be broadcast to rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Communications Commission at the House of Representatives as part of the BBC's future talks.
If you keep the licensing fees that I’m not sure whether they’re a good idea in the medium or long term, the production should be reduced at least with regard to programs that others don’t produce or don’t put on.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get the broadest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would transmit it is a ridiculous joke, and of course no sense.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on the home soil.
Other channels would give their right hand.
I can’t understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don’t think that would weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he feels guilty of getting the ratings "for the ambitions of people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to get long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC shows repeats those that the former Sky CEO, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that the BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more hicked public service programs of the BBC "go to the BBC4, where quite often you can't measure the audience, but they fulfill their authority and can argue when they're going to their hypocrite mission to justify £4bn income from licensing fees, "But of course we do all these obscure programs that no one looks at."
They broadcast them in a time when no one looks at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who will get the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds per year is a big amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I would wonder if they paid so much because they don’t look so much on the BBC.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who spoke in front of the commission on Tuesday, said that the BBC should review its Reith's mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC’s production was now previously classified as educational – once it was 1% television production and 0.1% radio – and should take the pattern of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to “inform, clarify and entertain.”
On the topic of partnership, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast only a few on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
“Sonogenetics” or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the bulbs move.
Scientists have educated worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small bulbs change direction when they are affected by sound impulses that are unheard to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Scientists know how to read and record brain activity using light
Scientists said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation – an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are dropped into the patient’s brain.
The noise usually does not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, the bubbles strengthen the ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Strengthening ultrasound waves act in the ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells to which they are connected, a report from Nature Communications reports.
In order to control the glucose using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion channels TRP-4.
When he then used ultrasound on the so-modified worms, sound waves were strengthened by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where the modified motor neurons were activated.
The new method is much similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn and turn off neurons using light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without limitation and be sent directly into the brain.
“We believe that when we use genotherapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” Chalasani said.
He added that the method would find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and cells producing insulin.
Illegal torture equipment – right at your threshold!
It is an advertisement that destroys British weapons trade.
Watch the video of the anti-armament market by Amnesty International.
Threatening drones!
Eyes on the legs that break the necklaces!
Three missiles!
And electrical shrinking boxes that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave any traces!
The joyful voice and cartoon metaphors don’t leave anyone in doubt that this advertising at the world’s largest weapons exhibitions is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International because of highlighting the government’s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facility International Veselice at ExCeL Centre in the London Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the rise of posters on bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"The important announcement, Travel on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using the fonts with the London metro mark with the DLR lines becomes the picture of the tank.
This year in September, the row of weapons traders will descend to the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop weapons trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective called Special Patrol Group helped them distribute throughout London and using the “Ad Space Hack Packs”, which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which allegedly “racks access to approximately a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet.”
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists move to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world to have their art an impact on society.
Another poster against the trade of weapons health passengers in the metro.
Amnesty’s video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working free of charge and the graphic designer and commentator also worked free of charge.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the weapons trade ads – he saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar – and thought: “Let’s show them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They were playing with creating more realistic risky corporate advertisements, but "by adding diverse colors and animations, I achieved that it would attract more people."
“They made a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the exhibition,” says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is the UK government to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded at our threshold.
Per the most creative art surrounding the weapons store comes from the interior of ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantasticly euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army on "the shoulder AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects behind the arms inside the target."
Whatever it is, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an unthinkable nineteenth-year-old boy, still believing in baret and moral relativism, but only now I’m equipped with the tensioned smile of those I’ve bothered – and numerous, long-lasting complaints on others.
Everything I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the roads can move from slightly to the nerves going to totally shocking.
It’s fascinating to be foolish: tell people where you’re from, if you’ve taken a year of break, what you’re thinking about Corbyn, and why “I sincerely don’t love or just don’t hate Marmite, because people, it’s just an extract of HAHAHA grapes, I’ll be with you in peace.”
Breathe deeply.
And help others to also breathe - ask yourself and show interest.
It runs the conversation and will help you find the people you like, and those you would not have to talk with, even if your wrinkles were in one fire and they would release firearms.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often transformed into drinking receptions, movies and public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Do not even think about starting to go to college and being in a relationship
Introverts at high will come shortly.
Your room should be a shelter, yet a lot of routes are transformed into an extra-room walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
This can be a hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can return to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when a fellow student is tired of socialization - and maybe write to him instead of clicking.
When you are talking about climbing: climbing.
One boy in my rails had the habit that if the door is not locked, he is invited to enter.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started to go to the university at the top of a baking mania, knocking on a stranger door and showing with a plate cooked cakes seems a little less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, something I got you, now smile while I'm asking personal questions."
Providing home flavours is a good way to find friends.
Your co-habitants will feel obliged to talk to you and everything will end up by attributing your face to a delicious surprise.
This is, of course, the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and turtle will likely prevent others from pretending to sleep when you try to knock them at the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in the school.
Theft of a whole chicken is of course a crime, but is a drop of milk into your tea theft?
Check it with the milk owner twice.
There’s a chance they’ll offer you milk even if they’re bitter inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my co-habitant, who has exchanged her milk for a dishwasher to punish the thief.
He is now in prison.
You should not make sounds that disrupt people from sleep or study.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, but you’re also famous people in glass houses.
The girl from my corridor asked her neighbors if they could silence a little drum and bass because they were 3 in the night and in the morning she had a letter.
Their response was the strengthening of music.
When they finally silenced at 5 a.m., she left them sleeping for two hours and then released her own music, closed the door and left her three-hour letter.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future coat went on the same colleges as you?
And on the contrary, would it not be tremendously shameful if you misleaded your cohabitants for your future hoot, slept together, split up and had to see each day, and it would also take over the control of your joint friends?
Of course, the heart will not be advised - but if your sexy co-habitant is a hundred percent not your future coat, try to talk at least a little with your weaknesses.
In the rising moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin boundary between fun and harassment.
A good joke is funny, but it’s easy to fix.
Learn them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding them something - never destroy someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Close them the door and give them the keys to a bottle of water, which you then put into the freezer - but never lay their things on the roof more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
She has been pregnant with her seven-year-old daughter.
His father was separated with her and for the preparation and education of the child was alone.
With the situation I got to deal quite quickly - I was very looking forward to the child and was looking for positive in it.
Uncertainty and by being alone with the child, I tried not to bother.
And I had in myself the hope that we will not stay alone for a long time, today Eve remembers her first pregnancy.
She already met on the internet on the chat of the elder Vaška, with whom they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Vašek Eva and Vítka even brought home from the birthplace, but he didn’t get too much into the role of his grandfather.
"For some time he then dropped off the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in the Three.
The motivation of the third series of the Czech television series is just looking for happiness for the second attempt.
The care of Vítka and the financial security of the family managed thanks to part-time work and great help of the mom and the teta’s help.
Even the prospects of liability for a stranger child eventually didn’t ruin Vaškov’s affection to Eve.
Definitely they gathered around Vítkov's second birthday and he now understands Vaška as his father and also addresses him so.
Although Vašek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys paternity at the age of sixties according to his words and is also more dedicated to children.
In addition to this, there was a two-year-old Leontynka and, in the end, a twin.
“Vašek entered our family so naturally, even by the fact that my mother never talked much to me in relationships,” the smiling Eva thinks.
Few places?
At least we are close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by the Emperor's cut after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disruption in the production and activity of yellow acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant women and are manifested by swelling.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is threatened by premature birth and death, with the mother after birth mostly self-determined.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Vaškov's happiness, even though they were only in the 36th week.
The Emic was placed in the incubator at the intermediate department, where the Vašk's grandson works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after transporting from JIP to the room I had her with me, describes the challenging period after birth Eva.
She spent twenty days in the birthplace until the doctors voted with the release of babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the birth of the children in the birthplace of Eva joy did not do.
"I was crazy with the trouble of my husband and children," the six-week four-time mother remembers the difficult moments at the department.
She also thought about signing a reverse with her husband, among other things because of the unsensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But it did not happen, and the doctors released Eva and the twins to home care.
The story of four pregnancies and births will be broadcast on Tuesday at 21:45.
A large number of families are able to get rid of.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to get enough with an electric twist and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but Vašek made Eve a pleasure by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If it’s hard, we’ll switch to a taxi.
Eva is convinced that the children perceive especially family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or foolishness of the house.
So far, we have been very good, better than we expected.
The disorder is worse to hide in a small space and we sometimes overcome the baby, but at least we are all nearby, Eve smiles, who can find a positive side on every situation.
The work of the lighting machine at the film is not a guarantee of regular receipt.
Sometimes he goes to the streets as a taxi driver.
In his sixties, according to his words, the care of the finance of the family and children physically manages, but how long will it be?
“I realize that due to our age difference, I will once be the one who will feed this family,” Eva acknowledges in questioning about the future.
She would like to go back to work, but even more attracted by the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I am not a job owner.
And when it’s worst, we can switch to a taxi with our husband, a sympathetic blonde joke.
Apple has jo-jo effect.
Everything can be displayed.
A more powerful processor, a camera with a greater resolution, a more robust chassis or a touch power-recognizing display, which is shortly the preference of the newly introduced iPhone of the ninth generation.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s current trend is that every new generation of the iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
Exception was only the third and fourth generations, whose weight was slightly increased compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the disadvantage of the given news was really negligible.
This is far from true for the new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model and 20 grams for the larger.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year’s affair of swinging in the pockets of Apple greatly troubled.
Shasi novinek is so from more resistant aluminium alloy 7000, which has also been reflected on the weight.
But much more impact on it are displayed.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to recognize the touch power.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with another layer of capacity sensors.
The weight of new iPhones has increased more than twice compared to the previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from 12 grams to 29 grams, and for a larger iPhone from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest used component.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty thanks to the dirting cortex, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, it is the hardest used element of the battery, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessors.
Even in this case, the greatest increase is visible at the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
The extent to which the new display technology will be practical, it will only appear when used.
The first users will be able to try it on Friday, September 25, when iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will begin to sell in selected countries.
Are champions’ breakfasts for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists succeeded in finding that opens interesting possibilities.
They discovered the traces of settlement by a modern man from different times, including wall paintings, remains of tools and so on and so on.
In the layer 23A, which is according to the tools dated to the time about 30 thousand years ago but the scientists discovered something that very reminds of the remains of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, there have been traces of oatmeal grains on the site, which seemed to have passed through the process of producing so popular flocks today.
With it, the grain today first moisturizes, then it drows, removes the packaging, the so-called pluch, then it spars and dissolves the pluch.
In the Paglicci cave, a grain was found, which was thought to be heated or sprinkled, and then apparently broken between two mill stones - at least this is indicated by the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, the scientists were unable in their publication for the PNAS magazine to prove that a complete process of flock production would take place in the cave, but the similarity is actually very noticeable.
We also don’t have any evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some fluid and even warm, of course, is offered quite logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensely humans used grains long before the development of agriculture.
If the flock interpretation is correct, the oldest flocks have preceded agriculture for about twenty thousand years.
A new report of stations in the Transportation Company of the City of Brna.
So I once again listened to the reports of the names of stations in the troleibus: Hnusáčkova, Přízrak, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the troleibus was slightly noisy, so reporting by the male voice was slightly less understandable than before when the stops were reporting by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
Although DPMB argues that this speaker was selected by the passengers themselves – I don’t know who, no one asked me, but they definitely selected it from the studio recordings taken in absolute silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the bus engine frame.
I have lived in Brno for a nice couple of decades, so the correct names of all those stops I know to remember, so I don’t need this report, but foreigners elsewhere who don’t know themselves in Brno and for whom these reports are mainly intended can be confused and can at the end, where they mistakenly arrived, then claim that the stop on which they had to go, was not at all.
Per the choice of the speaker - but better again the speaker - should be done again, and this time undercolored by the usual traffic noise and the motor rack, in which the speaker's climbing in the bus is almost lost.
So we don’t have to keep listening to the names of the stations of Water Heršpice, Šmírova, or Ponorná in the scraping shalin, to which I passed in Komárová.
I suppose that my old-age hearing did not worsen so much at once during that single day when the speaker of the stop changed.
I understood this report quite well.
Good morning, co-chairman.
from the trailers.
Nowadays, very few people know what the greatest and smartest of the party’s governments were the so-called comprehensive checks.
I allowed to remember it.
The bus was delayed.
I hit the dispeaker's office at the moment that the radio heard that it was just seven hours.
“You’re lucky that you didn’t collide with your fellow chief, came a minute before you and it seems that you don’t have a mood,” the dispecher noted while I was writing into the book of arrivals.
Thank you, I will take care.
Write to me that I’m going through the circles to review the small mechanization.
This will not be done today, the tests are done.
Everyone is scared of it, scared of it.
What is it really about?
“But you’ll see,” the dispatched dispatch.
The next time you will be too.
I went to the corridor.
Then the door of the headquarters opened and the headliner appeared.
Strong, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling corner.
“Good morning, Mr. Chief,” I greeted honouredly and quickly turned up two buttons of the same-crow.
“Good morning,” the answer sounded, and I quickly ran out to the second floor, without realizing the cold, evil tone the old man answered.
“You’re playing,” the engineer Eva welcomed me, the elderly lady that I very much appreciated.
She was also a leader before her fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow.
There’s a check and you’ll come like that.
How many times I have asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk much about it.
They live once every three years, they have to go to them all, and it’s quite unpleasant.
At least for some.
I say I will see.
I pulled out of the fool with periodic reports and the phone.
“Here, Holcman, come to me immediately,” the head’s voice sounded.
What annoys?
Now we met and nothing ..." I smiled, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
“Good day, colleague chief, I came to your order,” I smelled myself, kidly I entered the chief office.
The chief was sitting behind the writing table and looking at some leagues.
“Companion mechanizator,” he said after a moment, without lifting his head and still carefully looking at the least, “your behavior I don’t like at all.”
He throwed the leather on the table, stood up in the chair, and looked up to me with an ordinary, unpleasant, evil, crazy sight.
I was uncertain.
What is happening?
Even yesterday, the deputy praised me that in those months in office I worked very well and that he was very pleased with me.
That the boss did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at a distance.
And this now?
Be aware that you are a distance trail technician and according to that you have to behave.
Such a greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I cried that I used such a greeting since childhood, that I was so raised and that I can’t see anything wrong on it.
For the boss it was like a red hand on a crocano.
“You’re on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work,” he said.
In addition, you are still misleading the address of the bosses.
One time you say “Mr” and the second time you say “Mr”.
I am not a leader, but a co-chairman.
Deputies are fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow.
Please remember it!
Sorry, Mr. ... colleague chief, but ... but I greet you with a regular citizen greeting.
There’s nothing wrong with it... and it’s the honor of the work, or the companion... you know... I’m not on the side...
“It’s not your preference that you’re not on the side,” the chief coldly spoke, which at the same time calmed a little.
But there will be a talk about it.
Remember that you don’t have a pension in the upper chair.
It was not good.
When the boss told someone that something was not his preference, it didn’t look good with the person concerned.
For a moment, he awakened me with a cold, crazy look and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also surprised by his upgrading.
He was only a couple of years older and he played a masterpiece, actually a companion.
He is so genuine, arrogant, and autoritarian, as he was right now.
Everybody scratched him.
He is the boss.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, ticked him like all the parties, but also the non-parties.
But the chief touched many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
Now he has caught me for a full wrath.
I thought something about the fuck and it cost me enough overwhelming so that I didn’t shoot it into his knight.
But I would no longer go back to the straw to the potato, not to continue to be a drawing officer.
What do I give to two kids?
This is a built house!
I was in the shock, but I controlled myself.
I will not give him that joy.
“It’s all for now, you can go,” the chief ended audiences and began again carefully looking at the legstro that he had before in his hand.
At 12:30 I was called.
All of the offices were already there and on the questions what and how, they answered that yes, that it would be good.
Just Yoshin spoke, as his habit was, that they can’t throw us all out, because that work would have to be done by the co-chairman himself with his faithful, and that it is not in danger.
The word “friend” he emphasized, as if he knew what the old man shot me in the morning.
There was a nice meeting in the headquarters.
The co-chairman behind his writing table and at the long counseling table other co-workers who had to decide whether or not to be my official.
Kádrovák, the Chairman of the ROH, the writer of the staff, the referent for special purposes, something on the way of contrast on the army, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the streak.
An ordinary trail worker, who was buriing the prays or throwing a straw with the videls.
But also the former clerk.
It was said that there was no fun with him at the time, said a nice beast.
The bad languages claimed that he went out of school in the seventh class, he did not learn anything, he did not know anything.
And when the crime was cancelled, he ended up on the straw at the potato.
But the companion, that yes, the companion was coveted!
The chief ordered me to sit.
There was a little soul in me, in my neck an untouchable sheet.
Kádrovák read the opinion of the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I’m married, two children and so on and so on.
So far it was good, I thought, and I was breathing a little better.
A statement from the party’s street organization.
He copied the opinion from the Civil Committee, probably both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of long-term members of the party, refused to present themselves before the inspection committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The boss looked at me sharply.
He noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief ordered it to continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was obtained as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I was married and I had a wedding in the church in addition to the National Committee.
I disappointed the party in the worst way.
I was dismissed from the number of candidates.
But that is not enough!
I left both children to be baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I had a church funeral, although it was a former member of the party.
I have a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When the chairman read, only the touching of the chief's pen into the plate of the table interrupted the tensioned silence.
Everyone looked at me and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
I repeated in my spirit, “Communists – supernatural, communists – supernatural.”
Why do I prefer not to stay with the cowboys?
I was able to repair the scratches without any controversy.
But now?
She took her career before she started.
Return to the team?
I’m sure I’m going to go out for an hour, I’m sure I’ll go out for an hour.
“Comrade, how did you check the here discussed comrade?” interrupted the tensioned silence the chief with the question on the cabinet.
According to the previous job.
Do you have him here?
Of course, it was not overwhelming.
On the scraps he craped sweat, nervously mocked, as if he had been inspected himself.
He went on and gave a paper to the head.
“Well,” said the chief with a clue of jealousy, which, however, was often a prejudice to the storm.
At first glance the praise itself, taught with honour, graduated from the industry, worked in the job salary as a remnant, the standard fulfilled in an average of a hundred and twenty percent.
But the substantial is missing.
Where did you get that opinion from, companion?" he turned again to the cader, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a cader.
Here the companion gave it to me, at the arrival.
Was it enough for you?
“When he came to us, he went to the squad,” the chairman blinked.
And there the reviews are not required, the one of him was somewhat extra, so I put it in the folder.
“Therefore, when engaged in the technical function, this car of paper was enough for you,” the head said.
He was nervous and had no response.
"It doesn't matter, we'll discuss it later," the head closed the matter and the cadrovak was obviously relieved.
So far it stood.
“So what about you, companion?” the boss turned to me again.
So suddenly, it is the end!
I was dark in my eyes, I was hot.
It followed a flood of regrets and accusations, and I knew that I was the most resistant creature in the world that is not worthy of any mercy.
That by submitting an incomplete assessment, I mistaken the co-referent of the cadry, and I did not understand why the assessment was incomplete when I received it from the cadry in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist person who, at the time of the building of real socialism, supports and even participates in religious darkness.
That, that, there was a lot of all that I did, or maybe I still do, and I silently prayed for it to end.
I was no matter all.
I didn’t care if I went out of the mechanizer.
I didn’t care if they took me the potato.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the co-leader.
“So it would be enough, co-leader,” the party’s chairman suddenly spoke and strongly interrupted the leads of the levit.
He made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake he did!
He has already received his punishment.
Do not forget this, co-author!
What can be worse for a young man than closing the door to his side for a while!
To open up again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated bacharest spoke like a book.
Where did it go in it?
Is he so counted or papouškoval phrases from party training and meetings?
That is why this young companion must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove it has changed.
And who should give it to him, if not you, the co-chairman?
It is your duty to support this young, truthful, slightly misleading companion in his efforts to rectify!
It is your party duty that no one will get rid of.
It is a party duty for all of us.
Here the colleague must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother not only punishes, but that she also loves.
When the president ended, no one voted.
No one expected such a shift.
At least I.
“I totally agree with you, co-chairman,” the chief led to try to take the initiative again.
If you let me agree, you would hear that I was going to this conclusion.
They all agreed with their heads, but it was seen on them that they did not believe him a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of an independent referent of basic resources," I hugged when I returned to the office and later I was crying.
Unfortunately, all other people were on lunch.
That silence listened to my unrelated reading of fresh experiences and I still calmed.
When I finished, she asked if I would get a coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she put the water on the cooker and prepared a pot.
Meanwhile, he talked about the Cadry practices.
As one judgment, often full of praise, they put a man in hand, and the other, in which there is any dirt, they send to the new employer.
But I didn’t end where I had, but on the brick at the potato, so the factory colleagues didn’t know where to send it.
What about our cabinet?
He was only old, where he would eat or drink, and so it ended up, how it ended up.
“It’s the old man,” she pointed out badly.
He will not taste it today.
Be careful, he’s very gentle.
The party chairman?
In fact, much worse of the leader, no people.
Zero from a potato that has great power.
The coffee water began to heat and later the office was filled with the smell of the coffee.
I threw a cup of sugar into the pot and silently mixed a hot lektvar.
I am from the worst outside.
I’m not going to get rid of it now, and there’s another trial in three years.
I think the boss will not forget that day.

The city symbol has survived.
The wheel of the wind over Chlum again turns after years.
It is visible far, because it is located on a fifteen meters high staircase.
People from the broad surroundings call him "the wind on the clum".
For the municipality with 150 inhabitants it has even become one of the elements of the municipality character that the municipality obtained to the occasion of the collapse of the indigenous in 2010.
“We asked for a sign then and we wanted to have a wind on the sign, of course, everyone knows it around,” said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a memory of the present: it reminds us of the time when the people here fought for quality drinking water.
That in the past centuries was rare.
Only in 1910 the Chlumski representatives decided for a solution, which then suited until the middle of the 1980s.
In the village near the cave on Chíchov they let a seven-meter deep hole be depthed.
Three years later, the hole was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the town, near the church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic on Moravia with a cost of 2,400 crowns," the memorandum is stated on the ground cover of the building.
The pump, after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: that day a new water pipeline began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a non-functional municipal symbol and a rare here.
The dominant was held at this year’s countryside.
Only in 2008 the Chlumští decided that the wind bike would be repaid and put into operation again.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The bicycle was placed on the staircase, but the bicycle had to be taken down in the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the bike did not resist the wind.
Then the chlum dominant for several years rested broken under the roof.
However, since June this year, the wheel has been rotating again on the high stand.
On the occasion of the collapse of the natives, the municipality laid the replica of the wheel to be adjusted and again placed it at the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel pulls useful water from the hole only into the overhead blind arm.
And over the summer we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the hole.
At least it was empty.
“In the autumn, we will re-connect the wind wheel from the pump in the basket again,” the mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel has come into the municipality, but it is the only wheel of this kind in the entire Vysočině.
Similar element in the character they have in honor of local technical monuments for example in Chvalkovice and Green Mountains on Vyškovsk, in Kuželovo on Hodonínsk, Partutovice on Přerovsk or in Police on Vsetínsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafata, Tripolis Goian's support acknowledged.
“I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone in my career,” 34-year-old Goian smiled at a press conference.
At the time we were trained by Georghe Hagi, it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope I get a goal to Sparta.
Just with the difference that this time we won’t lose,” Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the attacks of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, says Spartan Hybš about the Greek battle.
And he partly knows what can expect him on Thursday night.
I know Fataie who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their matches at that time.
I know he’s a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, Goian said.
Another footballer of the Prague club was not named, and so came the direct question, whether he knows David Lafatu, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and targeted Czech journalists with a slightly exciting look.
The unhelpful expression in his face meant, “Why do you ask me about this?”
After a moment of silence he started.
We watched some videos and I noticed that Sparta played a lot of team.
He has really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don’t know anyone else except Fataia.
The Spartans know about Goian very well.
“He has experience with larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, it’s their organizer of the game,” spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal observed.
Goian has the best years behind, but he can have a very interesting football biography.
During his time, he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steauy he went to the Italian Palermo, he played for Glasgow Rangers.
We are waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European Cups, winning in the Czech League.
For me he is a favorite in this match, but we play at home and we want the group to start with a good result.
Just like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in peace with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very pleased with the rival of the Czech Republic.
I too.
But for the whole team I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be in Kofola.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading the company’s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are predominantly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the events in society, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
“In connection with the transfer of the headquarters of the group, the shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.”
Because of entering the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes a prospectus of securities, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the headquarters of the holding company and the related transfer of shares will be made in the form of a non-public transaction with the participation of existing shareholders only.
Therefore, no shares will be offered to be registered to the public or to new investors.
“The potential offer of shares to new investors would occur – if the company and its shareholders decide so – later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016,” the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any stock offer could consist of issuing new shares or selling existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the position of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
This is a test of the objectivity of the Czech Television in informing about the migration crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the news of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news broadcast of the Czech Television.
How did she stand?
Once they will be taught at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can launch today’s broadcast of the Czech Television Events.
The migration crisis was devoted to about 80% of news broadcasts.
Until the first minute, when the CT the ruins on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on the police called euphemisticly they had patience - they threw stones and attacked metals), the current promigrant propaganda was gone - judge the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a great space for non-profit organizations that criticize misbehavior of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Refugees - The Czech Republic consistently uses the terms refugees or refugees and not migrants.
Interesting is mainly the fact that CT in illustration images consistently uses only and only images for small children and women.
According to the report, 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Mostly propaganda, which has no precedent from the communist agites.
I have to say that as a former journalist I am ashamed for my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once got up to a panel apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I moved the fish to the bathroom.
Fish home, insects with the transformation of imperfect, i.e., not making that transition from a cushion to a cushion and young looks like an adult individual, it’s only small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting me and I didn’t want to lose them.
First manually and then chemically.
The Socialist drug industry provided some kind of blue crystals for their elimination.
It was called Cyclone B.
Or somehow differently?
However, it eliminated them successfully.
I later did the same with the Pharaohs.
A box with some kind of juvenalizer, which the myrtles brought into the nest and he then did not allow the queen to generate a new descendants.
But I turned it.
As time passed, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I was increasingly inclined to the opinion that they have the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have taken out of my life the experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one harmful can be replaced by the other.
The truth about the bleaches and puppets I't want to worsen karma by killing them.
In the new residence, we agreed with our partner that if we don’t get the fish to go behind our neck, let them eat the scratches of the falling skin, some of the invisible wrinkles, and so on.
Their peaceful existence was interrupted by a spider over time.
It was a common species of puppy who lived on the roof for a long time.
We thought it lived from occasional mosquitoes and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he feeds mainly with fish and that the number of them seemed to remain in a tolerant number state.
With confidential regular contact at every needed we found that it was a female.
We were witnessing romantic conversations with a partner about a third smaller, how carefully it bruns on the spider's fiber, so that it is not eaten before it reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days when they didn’t move and didn’t respond to our controls.
Under the toilet, where the love games were played, we later found the remains of the dried female next to the female.
The spider didn’t move for a long time.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging a rope around it.
They soon disappeared.
The work was eaten by the mother, and the work went elsewhere.
Even the female after a week disappeared somewhere.
Whether she went elsewhere or died, we don’t know, but after a month, two, she again appeared on the roof.
A little bit, probably the daughter of the bathroom.
For some time from the roof she carefully observed our behavior and by moving under the toilet table she assessed our non-attack as friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied fishes was reduced, and the spider was calmly looking at his usual activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem has not changed throughout the year.
Our daughter between this reached the age when using the nightmare was already a shame.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal flowing of its content has already been concerned with us.
We are increasingly encouraging them to use the toilet.
The daughter, however, found an excuse in that spider for keeping her bad habit, which she had seen very well when she was cleaning.
Our talk about the spider to see, happiness in the house to possess did not take at all.
She was crying and screaming for her nightmare.
There was no rest.
There was a time when the spider had to command, in the interest of the daughter's developmental shift.
It remains on me.
He was caught in a glass and thrown through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but after so long coexistence I felt ugly as if I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that fishes would begin to appear more frequently and begin to multiply by a geometric line.
The world wondered, a week, two, we did not appear there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider did not cultivate them in a way that the toilet environment was not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they had already been shed again.
I had to invent a different theory about the cause of their disappearance and I found that their bond to the spider had to have a cause in the fact that when they don’t see him, he’s hidden in some other place and that they are threatened by danger from anywhere.
Or, they had some telepatic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance in them caused some alarming reaction.
I don’t make any illusions about their eyes.
Some light shame showed, but that would react to handwashing or fast moves, it’s not.
My daughter goes to the toilet regularly.
I think she has forgotten the nightmare.
I just want to get a spider again.
I’m already sending my wishes into the ethereum and I hope that they don’t have managed on me after that execution.
Otherwise we would have to use that Cyclone B.
The Ten Decades of Albert Einstein that Enriched the World.
The statements of a genius scientist from the past century will probably never stop fascinating mankind.
He was able to swim into everything so deeply that the result was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most prominent scientists of all time.
He first entered the consciousness of human beings his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its giant proportion.
It is also impossible to ignore its clarification of the photoeffect or the idea of quanting the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complicated for many that for a closer acquaintance, they prefer to choose easy weapons.
However, it is not easy.
But it would not be Albert Einstein if he didn’t find a geniusly simplified form of explanation for this: The hour near your beloved looks like a minute; the minute in a hot oven looks like a hour – and that’s relativity.
I allowed myself from his whole playoff of famous quotes to choose those ten which literally captured me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Universe and human stupidity.
I am not so sure of the first.
None of the trials can never prove that I was right.
The only one can prove at any time that I’m wrong.
It is a sad time when it is easier to break the atom than to destroy the prejudice.
If the disorder on the table is a reflection of the disorder in the mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don’t know what it will be fighting in the Third World War, but in the Fourth it will be cracks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that my life would depend on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I can’t forgive myself not to mention Einstein’s formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula is valid: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue behind the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlínsk region are expecting changes for 1.5 billion dollars.
“It’s a success when we consider that all four holds in black numbers this year,” said hejtman Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of the district facilities is at the moment about 32 million kronor.
The share of this is mainly higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally beneficial for this year.
This also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford greater investments.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherský Hradišti and Zlín, thanks to this, the buildings will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we bought most of the devices ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the top healthcare can’t be done, the plans were justified by the district deputy for healthcare Lubomír Nečas.
There are changes in all hospitals.
The staff will be hospitalized next year.
In Vsetina, they are now selecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million kronor.
It is planned to build a dialysis port.
Hungary wants to build a new interior for approximately 200 million dollars to the central pavilion open this year.
And the Zlinsk Baťov Hospital is waiting for a long-established construction of a new central income and the interior, which will need three quarters of the billion.
In all cases, these are the major and often the greatest changes in recent years.
"For the entire region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Věra Prousková, the director of the hospital, for example, to the construction of the entire hospital.
The five-storey building will be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that mostly patients know will affect all regions.
New buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, on the floor they have just one toilet, beds are unplaced, windows are untouched and healthcare professionals do not have the appropriate conditions for work.
“For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the boundary of its lifetime,” said Zlinese Hospital Director Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will also have all emergency departments in one place, in addition, in new premises.
The same model has already half-ready Hungarian Gardens.
The central income is already in place and within three years it will be added to the internal.
“We will pay the building from the loan and partially from our own funds,” said director Petr Sládek.
This is the only hospital in the region that can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest and the loss has not come even two years ago, when the Zlinese hospital had a twenty-million loss.
“We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase income and efficiently manage costs throughout the hospital,” said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is responsible for the economy.
The improvements are expected to be seen by the patients of the Kroměříž hospital.
Within 10 to 15 years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repairs, new devices and reconstruction.
This year, it will be finished to repair the reception station, then the construction of the dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one told me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country when they don’t want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after talks with its European colleagues that the other countries push the Czech Republic to accept quotas for refugees, but refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should beined when they don’t want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specificly the position you came with at the talks of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We disagree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can’t talk about migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some vision, some direction, some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we could keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We cannot imagine it.
We did not get the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration places, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, with this we have no problem.
We have been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We had 40,000 recently, now it’s 20,000.
When will it be 500,000?
How will we keep the people in that area?
Nine-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don’t know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, get asylum at us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You have mentioned that the refugees do not really want to come to us, but we have already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn’t it be possible to take more of them on this path?
We are committed to receiving 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
More than 1,500 people will come to the country to deal with the asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility and we will treat them as well as those we have captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss with Europe whether we can arrest people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe behaves so that if they have a registration, they cannot be arrested.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it can happen that even those 1100 will not be held on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to that Germany after arrival.
If we are able to arrest them during the asylum procedure, we will deal with them an asylum procedure.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, then 98 percent according to European statistics get international protection.
Then they get documents that will allow them to travel throughout Europe.
And I think these people will end again in the target countries.
Then there are four hundred people who will move.
This is the second project that is still in the process, and there we have only progressed in discussing with the churches about the possibility that they could help them find jobs, accommodation, and so on.
But this is a run on a very long track.
You said that the ministers were not willing to discuss the talks with us.
Is it not that the Czech Republic only rejects the quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would block the discussion?
What do you think is a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can get to them, the report will spread in hours across all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This suggests another migration wave that goes to Germany because they simply don’t want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders – simply those migration waves to disrupt, to help those in need, and to separate economic migrants.
Clearly show them that they have no chance.
Only last year 50,000 Kosovans arrived in Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, prosecutors.
If we succeeded in separating them and not receiving them or receiving them only according to the needs of the economies, then that fifty percent of what today the social systems spend on them in vain could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It was eighty, the first day was twelve.
What is going to happen to strengthen border controls?
We were afraid of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we manage.
We still have several hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we arrest will be returned to Austria within seven days.
We do it standard.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people to us, with Hungary it’s difficult and the Greeks – that’s a completely useless story.
Where is the breakpoint?
Should it be a thousand per day?
I think it should be a few hundred per day.
Two hundred, three hundred people per day, two or three consecutive days, will exhaust our capacities so much that there will be crisis plans.
Then I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister that he would immediately summon an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If such a situation occurred, the government could meet de facto immediately and by one resolution would decide to strengthen the police for the army, let’s give it the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the emergency state that has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I think this cannot be so far to us.
Remember that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don’t know what should happen to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don’t want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, and Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to unlock the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
This would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost at all.
At the end of the day, Slavia has paid a lot of its debt.
This will prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
The football team has paid its debt.
The footballers also had their money.
On Tuesday, the football team for the first time appeared in court for insolvency proceedings.
Nearly three months after the proposal was submitted by Online Services from the Pacific Samoa for about 20 million SEK.
Slavia’s lawyer Zuzana Mládková tried to convince judge Michael Wenzlow within a few hours that she had no obligation to declare slavery.
He said he had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week with the new owner of Slavia became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Evidently, the money came from the new owners to the club, and that at the last moment.
This is also demonstrated by Slavia's statements before Tuesday's trial - the Vršovic club on Monday, just a day before the trial at the court, sent debt tens of millions of crowns.
“Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15,” the lawyer Slavia Mládková said.
To whom did Slavia pay?
current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech Deputy Mariu Ličkovi.
Slavia also paid the fee to the agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid the debt fees for the city part of Prague 10.
In the case of insolvency, in fact only claims that Slavia contradicts remain part of the insolvency dispute.
For instance, the commitments have not arisen at all, or there are legal disputes.
However, we are ready to pay the amount in case of loss of these disputes.
“We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can prove with a bill out of the account,” the lawyer Mládková told the court.
"Everything that was after the deadline is paid," Mládková said, adding that unpaid are only unpaid or contradictory obligations.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavii three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the aforementioned debt.
All the evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can be expected at first in November.
The judge ordered the trial to continue on November 3.
However, the decision will not fall even at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

It was built so that it didn’t fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
It was even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built so that there were no two land falls in Stromovka in Prague, says Satra's production director, which is the main tunnel designer, Alexander Butovich.
He said this on Wednesday afternoon during a journalist tour of the tunnel.
He said it would be about half a billion dollars more expensive.
The driver will be open on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and security.
“The tunnel was safer, but the costs are increasing exponentially,” Butovich said.
The conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the country fell just a few steps from where it began to rise by a safer and more cautious method.
“If the measure had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive,” Butovich said.
The Tunnel Blanka collapsed three times during the construction.
Two times, in 2008, the crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the soil fell at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to CEO of Metrostav, Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, the Eurozone newspaper said.
According to the initial plan, the building was worth 17 billion kronor.
If we add to that VAT, which has jumped twice over the time of construction, you have twenty-one billion.
When technology, land purchases and engineering, valorization and similar items are added to it, it is 29 billion, which is no longer so far from the 37s, Belohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid it.

Mixed FedEx Profits, Reduced Fiscal Prospects for 2016
FedEx unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge decrease in annual profit forecast due to the low demand for cargo and higher land division costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
During this period of last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5 percent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx reports that it expects a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
Reduced prospects come despite an increase in interest rates by an average of 4.9 percent, which will appear in January. 4, and higher fees for land transport of heavy or large packages, which start in November.
The company said it is still expecting a profit growth compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "proved solid performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, in the processing industry and global trade."
The vacation hiring plans were announced a day after the rival company UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional employees, which is about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has strengthened the outcomes of the land unit FedEx.
In the last quarter, land revenue increased by 29 percent, but the operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The Express unit higher revenue due to higher basic rates, while the profit fell in cargo trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-market trading about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record from June 11.
On their most anticipated meeting over the years, the Federal Reserve legislators will spend this week two days sitting at the 27 feet long Honduras Mahagon table and will decide whether after almost ten years it is time to raise the key interest rate.
Sticking above them at one end of the central bank’s ornament, a two-storey meeting room will be the wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have to put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Central Bank has a double goal from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed’s representatives recognized that there was an unwritten third term of office: financial stability.
And this third term of office could be a X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to start with a stop from an unprecedented incentive in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates on the site since the end of 2008.
Although most data show a solid growth of the economy, recent turbulences on the world financial markets could already scare the prudent Fed because of adding to instability by raising its reference rate of federal funds - even no more than a quarter of the percentage point.
“It’s obvious that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist of the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they’ve just been looking for an excuse to not increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness on the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate rise this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to hold the matter, with a key indicator only about 30% of the chances of growth.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rates, only if the politicians mild down the promise that the further increase is in negligence.
On Tuesday, the industrial average of Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The meeting was launched with the expectation that the Fed politicians will hold the rates this week calmly, says John Lonski, the chief economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed now raised the rates,” he said.
If the Fed politicians did, "they would have to go to the extreme in their program statement and keep the financial markets in their hands so that panic doesn't fall."
Other experts claimed that the rise of rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about how the Fed will move.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on a good way to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slowly strengthening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer she is expecting a rate increase this year despite the complaints from the liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the creation of jobs in August has slowed down, the labour market has seen a solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
The earnings showed signs of rise.
And while inflation continues to go below the annual 2% target of the central bank, Fed politicians say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can deal with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to swallow at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones' industrial average dropped up to 16% below its record in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would pull down global growth.
The market slightly reflected this month and Dow is now losing just 10% of the May maximum.
The Fed's political officials are concerned about the market situation providing a comprehensive calculator when to start the rise of interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened on the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, this meeting would have been strengthened," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA's chief researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now it predicts that they will wait at least a month to get better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The only clue by the then president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could “sweat” their monetary expansion on the market, has triggered cramps around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely connected, it is expected that the Fed leaders will also monitor developments elsewhere, but they will also consult with other central bankers and experts in order to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy for Wealth-Management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of exaggerated with movements on the financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy of the Federal Committee for the Open Market, who pushed to raise rates, quoted the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions "although limited identifiable impacts on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prefer concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The latest rains are not even approaching this level, he said.
"You don't want to be in a situation of fear of the rise of rates because the markets are angry," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economy Peterson .
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don’t think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese district.
The Chinese Quarter
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
It is a Chinese neighborhood and not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/stock is the only contact point that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen dishes, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need a little motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour before you cross all the streets.
If you’re hungry, go to LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal shopping station (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pickup points.
What is in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You’ll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The extension of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the plate will wash you and go out, even you will smell it if you want it,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezing section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole cows, fish, cow blood and yellow, pig intestines, fish balls, regional cabbage, free-sale semi-products and more.
Who is shopping here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Large streets meet shopping wheels and high lift wheels.
Fresh monthong durian next to the box stand.
Where it is located: The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of the Chinese district and the center - a couple of blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways remains the old.
Acceleration to 150 km/h has been rejected.
On selected parts of the highways, the maximum permissible speed will not be increased to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives approved the Senate's amendment, which rejected the speed increase.
The amendment of the Land Communications Act will now be addressed to the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said at the end of April that the law allowing a 100-kilometre speed would veto.
Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for ANO) was opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech highway network has not yet been built on such a speed.
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives approved the law.
The approved novel will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, four-way.
The Senate first extended this option to the highways, which could be used in selected sections with a speed of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate rejected it.
The members of the parliament have approved his proposal.
Senators with the consent of the Ministry of Transport have also excluded the authorization of the traffic police to have the last word in the modification of the local communications that the municipalities take care of.
The Senate version, which has been approved by the House of Representatives, also expects the canalization, water pipes or public lighting cables to be stored along the surface of the roadways.
In this way, the municipalities will save for the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The Novel also aims to help improve road protection and facilitate municipality handling of removed vehicles to which owners do not report.
Newly, the municipalities could sell removed vehicles, which their owners will not register within a six-month period after the announcement of the removal.
Municipalities will have the possibility to exclude transit cargo transport through their territory on the roads of second and third classes under the threat of fines and for shipping companies.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic highway trademarks instead of existing paper trademarks, which will also be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The expressor goes before the court.
He is threatened for 10 years for the welcoming of the citizens.
The case relates to the alleged overwhelming project Welcome to citizens.
The police wanted to prosecute the deputy Zuzana Kailova (ČSSD) in this case, but the parliament did not issue her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, the two are at risk of up to ten years in prison.
The main trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the prosecutor, Mandík and Macik caused damage at least one million crowns, according to the accusation.
The applicant is based on an expert opinion.
Former members of the city management, according to the prosecutor, on the title of their functions illegally allowed to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcoming of citizens.
Mandik, according to the accusation, ordered the then chief of the magistrate department of urban services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the tender procedure.
When the competition was submitted by another company that offered the lowest price, the municipality cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted by the city to the administrator and only the Darothore company was enrolled in the competition, which was then awarded by the City Council.
The city has paid a million more.
Both accusations aimed at ensuring Darothore’s award of public procurement to organize the Ustí nad Labem Citizens’ Welcome event on a long and coordinated basis acted at least in contradiction with the requirement of the procedure with the care of a regular economist, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that the company Darothore subsequently, after the acquisition of this contract, will charge the Ustí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome to Citizens event the price, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the actual value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company according to the record for the project incassed more than five million SEK.
The city eventually paid only one portion, approximately 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert assessment, the amount paid was at least a million SEK.
Mandik has previously rejected any violation of the law.
I have not committed any crime, I am innocent.
I don’t understand this constructed case, the former mayor said before, with the fact that the city under his leadership was only linked to a similar project from the past years.
From 2008 to 2010 the event was carried out by Roxy II.
“It was under the same conditions, for the same money,” Mandik added.
The criminals wanted to accuse the deputy Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
The House of Representatives did not issue her to prosecution.
Criminals have therefore postponed the case in her case, but they count on the fact that Kail will be accused after her parliamentary term ends.
The welcome of citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
The mother received a gift check for 5,000 kronor for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian police said they had released a dog to the refugee.
The journalists were forced to delete the record.
The Hungarian police said on the border with Serbia had briefly arrested a cameraman of AP and forced him to delete the record on which a police dog allegedly hit a refugee to the country.
The Hungarian government has challenged the allegations.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the corn field near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Against the refugees, the police proceeded and one of them allowed a certain Syrian to attack a dog with a basket on a cushion.
The man's dog who cried "Please, please, I'm a refugee," cried, says Muzi.
The fact that Muzi filmed everything was noticed by one of the police officers and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call either his officers or his colleagues on the site.
Police took Muzi to a dark place near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
This was the result of the two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The agency has sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She described the police’s behavior as unacceptable and said journalists should have the opportunity to cover the events without risking physical violence and they should not be afraid that the government will destroy the legally obtained material.
Kovács with reference to the police report of Muzi's investigation of the events questioned.
He said the police just wanted a journalist to show them whether they were on some pictures, which they said they had the right to.
When they found that they were not there, they did not force him to throw anything.
"Cats can crack - they are trained to frighten and catch a bit of fear, but with certainty they didn't attack," says Kovács.
Unpredictable Champions League.
The victory in the City will hit us, Juventus believes
“It’s a disappointment, I don’t think we deserve to lose,” said Manuel Pellegrini, home City coach.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
None of the teams did not create a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the crossing we had longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," Pellegrini, whose team incased in the competition after 636 minutes.
The finalist of last season Juventus was exactly the opposite before each other's match - after the first three rounds of the Italian League, he has only a point as a defense of the title and the score of 2:4 is only on the 16th place in the table.
The turn to the Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
“This win will psychologically help us, it will catch us,” believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new season – Pirla, Téveze and Vidala.
In Manchester they were represented by Pogba, Mandžukić and Morata.
“It’s so, this victory is terribly important, maybe thanks to it we’ll come to the winning wave,” Morata hopes.
Because when we are on it, we are ranked among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attack phase.
My players deserve this.
"Before our matching goal we could inkas to 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," coach Allegri praised Buffon.
“We’ve burned a few good chances,” Yayu Tourého, the City supporter, regretted.
We have to take the experience from the Champions League and try for a better result the next time.
Goodbye to Angelo, Goodbye to Old Germany.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media screening around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also the seshora.
So let’s stop for a moment.
Today, the newspapers and the media are filled with babies, which carry on their parents' hands after the dirty ways of exodus.
And this automatically triggers a sense of guilt and compassion in a person – i.e. in a European person.
Well, they don’t come here just desperate babies, see on the images of landing boats to the Greek islands that babies are not so much to see on them!
Well, somehow, we have recently disappeared from the television images of ships aiming at Lampedusa, refugees in front of the French border near Menton, near the beautiful promenade of which thousands of young men lie.
Most of the young black people.
And also disappeared images from Callais, where these eat and the black men wait for them to pass through the tunnel under La Manche.
Maybe it doesn’t matter anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much falsehood.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it’s somehow hidden that it’s not only unhappy children from Syria, but also exposed – for the elderly: fashionably featured – young men.
Their muscles look like they just got out of a fitness center.
Only one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we lie on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived on the beach.
No shunk.
And young black men came out.
Thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all clothes in brand clothes and shoes. in the hands, as otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, they were not interested and employees - Turks, Muslims! - obviously feared them.
They occupied all the beds.
Whoever was not on him and was just in the sea, was unfortunate.
They were dressed like a American rap film.
On the heads of a hat with a nail, white and colorful adidasks on the feet.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and began to throw.
They occupied the tables around, they slept to the sitting beside the eaten and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
The arriving black people drank beer straight from the third - like in the US series?! - on the beach they throwed empty bottles around themselves.
They were constantly screaming each other.
In English it was not.
Then they put themselves into drinking wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel swimming pool – in the branding swimming clothes, especially the young ladies – in the water, they cried and cried, the mothers with the children and the retirees fled terribly, and in half an hour there was no one black guest on the beach or in the swimming pool.
They all disappeared.
Whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The staff were afraid to talk about them.
The servant said to me half-hearted in the evening, “Have you seen the gold they had on?”
“Yes,” I said.
“They didn’t do it,” said the servant.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive golden chains around their necks.
And one had a roughly twenty-century massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like gold.
“Is this drug traffickers?” I asked.
“You’ve seen how they flock,” the servant replied.
The drugs do not consume, nor do they use.
They are doing something completely different.
I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important for me yet.
I didn’t know what was going to follow.
But the secret services and top politicians had to know it first.
I don’t think they didn’t know.
About 1.5 million migrants arrived in Europe at the time.
And they go and go and go.
Today it turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-politically-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and the lobbyist and economically important groups associated with them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians – today already publicly recognised major power in Europe – lie, lie and lie – but not only they, but also the top of the EU and television, including our.
For example, recent TV images about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV images from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunriseers on the station, but most importantly - the ancient Germans - Muslims welcomed their private men.
For a long time they were foolish in the news on Czech television, as it is said by some research, the Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But whoever was only a few days in Germany knows that it is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, over a week ago, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
This was by our television as well.
But they hid what happened the next day in Germany: that in the survey voting for the article it turned out that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want any immigrants - the survey attended 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly said in November 2010, five years ago, “Our efforts to ‘multi-cult’ society have completely failed.”
She said, “Germany is giving up the struggle for a multicultural society.”
“All efforts for such coexistence have completely failed.”
In a country where there are four million Muslims, she said there was no strategy that allowed people from different cultural environments to live next to each other without integrating. Today they live here with us and we have insisted for some time that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that is not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say that we just live happily next to each other, so this approach failed.
He completely failed.
But even Merkel may not have the power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
This indicates the escalation of events.
The conflict is rapidly increasing.
Euro-German Schulz, the Chairman of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one in the European Parliament allegedly does not have a graduate degree – yes, that’s the one that Berlusconi said in the EU parliament he could play from a minute to a concentrate – showed himself as many times.
It seems, especially under the impression of the recent statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Let’s note that despite some, most European politicians don’t support these statements, the nationals of the countries that were victims of Nazi are scared.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Which years have they tried, at least outside, to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are they right those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is seated in the soul of Germany?
Was the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he with all his strength stopped the Great Duchy’s attempts to control the whole center of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
Probably had.
When he was dismissed, preparations for the First World War began.
The idea of Great Germany, which brought Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the Marxist attempts to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of ecology, which was one of the main ideological doctrines of Nazism.
I would say sunny.
The German elites for a long time defended the emergence of German nationalism, and so left all those anti-atom fighters in peace, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, silently supported the old imperial and Nazi motto Our forest must live.
In order to satisfy the unhappy young people who everywhere in the world want to do something different and better, they fully inclined to the side of the warriors against the planet’s warming, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a strongly anti-Semitic – so-called the Palestinian – and an anti-Slovenian stream that considers all the Slavs a difficult verb – since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as shows the latest statements of Schulz and the German minsters openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states, the idea of leading Germany.
It is necessary to listen without rejection.
Otherwise bad for you!
And when we get into that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it stands, as always, the capital, especially the German, which is suitable for and which is derived from the fact that Germany actually controls most of the European countries through the banks and the Union.
The Pseudovir of the Sunrise first introduced the Germans into the basins of ecologism and multiculturalism and today brought them home and will bring millions of Muslims.
Those who are blurred by the voice of the sirene will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn’t want to see, and they will begin to storm.
Germany can only again threaten its neighbors with force, again it can a portion of its inhabitants – but it appears to be a smaller portion – ideologically crazy, but ultimately it will be reached by reality as always.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim houses are burning.
What will the German government do when the public protests of the Germans against the coming Islamists explode?
Who will help Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but are definitely not assimilated to take over local habits and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, coming Islamists and Germans, who are looking for their country’s Islamization with fear, go into themselves?
What will it do with the Germans, and at all with Germany, when the people will rise, who will protest loudly and publicly against the new euro-supernatural Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that in Europe caused by the support of the sunshine ideology, i.e. the ideology of the elite and in principle totalitarian, and its unsaturated banks, is growing.
And because of the unreliable action against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the subordinate and disobedient Eastern neighbors, this cannot be done well.
Complete tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of deceased sellers: scare them to death.
It’s enough to stick and the robust clay will turn on you in a way that weaker nature may not just stand.
The revival head will fit you well, and the revival will take you well, and the revival will accompany you (or rather the revival) to the way away, and the revival statue.
It may be a disgrace that the speech can’t be done in reality.
There will also be a lot of shrimp and shrimp for us.
Oxalis corniculata (Oxalis corniculata)
A small grass that tolerates the dry environment.
And so it is between the outer plates near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which although belongs to the expansive plants, but appears to make a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It is located between the outdoors.
It is unpleasant, it works well in our garden.
It loves a dry environment, it’s easy to adapt, modest and unnecessary.
It creates leaves with a chaotic composition, but it is worth watching it and continuing to photograph it.
Under the mirror is only the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a violet accompanying.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy breastfeeding diet
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS came with a shocking way to try to communicate to women knowledge about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding using images of children sailing from the breasts painted by the display of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Due to the excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and newborn mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic formation of their children and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have negatively affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's tries to take over the lead in Today Show
With Karel Stefanovice and Lisy Wilkinson's departure to Canberry due to the coverage of the costs for the consequences of the escape of liberal leadership, it failed to create a sufficient rating increase for Today.
The morning show Nine promoted from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's collapse by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage stumbled in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It didn’t seem that on this tyrannia of distance to the viewers Aussie TV so much depends, as it recorded an average of 397 000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330 000 viewers from Today.
Today a smaller increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but the number was only behind last Thursday (343 000).
Today in recent months fills the gap on Sunrise.
In August, Today was an average of 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise currently has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened in the morning.
The winds of change affect this morning more than just the parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for the opposition!
Added TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning 800 words debut with former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently married father, who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand, has an average of very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
The critics were thinking whether Thomson himself would be able to stretch a television hit without Rafters star Rebeccy Gibney.
The result of yesterday’s evening says clearly “yes”.
The X Factor of Seven retained a strong 1,136 million viewers, thus smoothly defeating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded the mixed followings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quis (from 17:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe' said, had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — which was enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers and the second half incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decline of the Chase Australia rating from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute show that failed to defeat McGuir's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who will he choose?
The secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwanted to find out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is covered by unbeatable secrets.
And the three girls who remain in state will definitely not reveal who is the right one who will eventually get the roses.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before they left just two, they told us who would win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue for his teeth until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically singed why Wood is a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambitions, family values and positivity as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, which will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as a spojler about who will get Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a mild relationship.
“Since I entered the house and observed Sarah and Sam’s energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think of it during the course,” Jeavons-Fellows says.
“Sarah is really a ground woman, it’s a lot of fun with her,” Markoski added.
I have seen them together and there is the right chemistry among them.
They are good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay believes that Sam Wood could be a prima couple.
For her, she claims that during her last visits at home she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game – I opened my whole heart to him now,” he added.
I asked who Wood would choose if he didn’t eat, she looked mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snezen and Lana unresolvedly.
Bachalor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.
Originally published as the best choice of Sarah for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States and a lot of teams were questioned about his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches left Hayne sitting for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian Rugby League at the first excavation at Tuesday's 20:3 win on Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he has confidence in the player and gave him another chance to return and occupy him into the game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of swallowing the newspapers before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only take care of the next game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It was not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start of his career in the NFL he could not even imagine.
“It’s happening, you’re just focusing on the next game and that’s all,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own goal territory led to the Queensland trio.
This was a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne has posted a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, the wealthiest man of Russia Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in the Siberian ranway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. supported immigrants who demanded refund of property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989 it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state with a request for compensation under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The court first assigned them the requested amount, i.e. over 2.8 million SEK, but the appeal court changed their claim so that it granted them only less than 90 thousand SEK with reference to the fact that the amount of the refund is determined in accordance with the price regulations of 1991.
The immigrants were supported by the Supreme Court and accused them of the amount originally charged.
The Ministry of Finance, which had to pay the money, turned a complaint to the US.
Meanwhile, there was such a change in the social and economic circumstances that the compensation granted in accordance with the legislation in force at the time — although it was then an adequate compensation in relation to the taken property — now reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
“This cannot go to the burden of the side parties as in the restitution of entitled persons who demand their rights at least since 1995 and who did not have the possibility of home with the granting of compensation earlier,” the judge reporter Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the US stood on the side of emigrants.
“The US has repeatedly stated that the general courts should proceed in restitution matters in such a way that any inconsistences are not interpreted in the disadvantage of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. the removal of the property fault caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved,” the judge added.
Evitu in the musical Studio Two will now be played by Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišar became the world’s youngest Evita when in 1998 she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech release of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Theatre of Spirala.
To return to the same role he says: "Today, the difficulty of Evity the power of the show has not been balanced."
Evita is not just a wonderful role, it is also a responsibility.
The first lady in Argentina was Monika Absolon.
I have seen Monchu in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I suddenly saw a new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern adjustments, but this is simply successful.
“Andreje Sokola’s directory is original, light and contemporary,” Fišarova says.
The song will take place at the Monika Absolon's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 19:00 in the Studio DVA Theatre.
The evening will end up with songs from the Evita musical.
It’s a good idea for you to play the Argentine Don’t Cry For Me (Don’t Cry For Me).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also jump off from the director's pult when he will represent during the filming of Karl Roden as President Peron.
For public interest, additional deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech studio of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondreje Sokola, the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolon.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs from the workshops of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with the Czech texts of Michael Prostějovsky sound in the presentation of a live orchestra under the leadership of Christopher Mark, who participated in the first introduction in the Theatre of Spirala.
Four people killed after police shot rubber missiles on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber missiles into a crowd of protesters against the proposal for a new state constitution, a official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district official, that more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they applied to rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber missiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative, obviously caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last in the week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern mountains of Nepal, where Madhesi members say they have established a new province under the proposed new constitution, and mitigated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards the new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislatives in Kathmandu this week voted on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials say the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We must not panic now.
After the defeat on the ice of the championship of Lithuania, you did not manage the home duel with the Spartan hockey players (3:5).
Are you not worried about a similar catastrophic entry into the extraliga as a year ago?
I hope that nothing like this will happen again.
Honour of people.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde is 60 percent likely to develop a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure system around the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the weather forecast based in Miami added.
Google has launched a campaign to collect $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it is launching a campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European states to escape from war-threatened and poor countries.
Google announced this in a very unusual way on its blog.
Rita Masoud, a Google employee, posted the report on her blog on the basis of her personal experience when she fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old.
“We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like that are willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all posts made via google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million will double.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them come from Syria affected by the four-year war, which only this year evacuated 4 million people.
Many people are also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery can be useful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are provided with non-chirurgical treatment.
“Data of mortality takes a long time to be seen,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an introductor to the new JAMA Surgery study.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric operations have been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight ratio related to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates a person’s overweight and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected from a 2007 study that deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastrectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those who undergone the surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given a surgical treatment for diabetes remained approximately the same at the value of 29.
Between patients with surgery, diabetes was solved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the medications of the group treated, diabetes was solved completely for comparison only in 1 percent and partially only in about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls have been shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflects the continued blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best to keep below 7 percent, researchers say.
After the operation, the average level of hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treatment group, this value remained at approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - which reflects in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not lower mortality in five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), achieved greater BMI decreases (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent to 2.1 percent) and had a greater likelihood of remission of diabetes (46.9 percent to 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to extension of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who submitted bariatric surgery had about 29 percent greater chances of survival over the next 15 years, compared to the group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, this is a calming result for people with BMI below 35, who are interested in these procedures.
"It's here that work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in the group with lower BMI," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also says that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient’s BMI decreased between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that when you once accumulate these genetic changes that will firmly link their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really difficult.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under current circumstances the interests of mankind should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation, no matter how admirable it was.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to resolve the crisis, he emphasized that it was just a temporary solution.
“To take care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you’ll have to think about a long-term solution to bring true peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also spoke about the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that “the U.S. violent reaction has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have eaten the sanitary agent in the last 4 years
Toxicological centers around the United States a 400-percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed high-alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the toxicological center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopez, director of the Georgian Toxicology Center, the number of consumptions of sanitary products in children under 12 years of age, which were to toxic control centers, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more frequently and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to emergency," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink the sanitary means intentionally, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drink a sanitary product because of the cheap whisper.
Adolescents were alleged to mix a sanitary product with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the agent.
“Children don’t think that it could hurt them,” Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitarian) are those that are perfumed.
To the deposit are sanitary products with the smell of beans, grapefruit or orange, which are very attractive for children.
The drug contains between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, several locks can indicate alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a highly concentrated alcohol,” said Fox 4 in Kansas City Medical Director of the Control Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You would also not let the glass of whiskey be just overwhelmed, but people leave these sanitary products out and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently worn up to four locks of a sanitary agent with the smell of beans in school and was taken for treatment to emergency.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside the Atlantic.
Nhaijah spoke unclear words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital for any signs of brain trauma, because the girl caught up and sprinkled into the head due to alcohol, Ritchey reports.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah.
It could be deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers the use of non-alcoholic products or to make sanitary devices from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitary means were linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after swallowing a sanitary device containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors believed that the product contained methanol, a fatal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year-old students in northern New York planned to poison their “bad” teacher by placing antibacterial products around the room,” the police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary devices and prohibited their presence in the room.
Police assessed the distorted plan as "innocent pushing," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
No disagreements in Celtic team
Griffiths bagatelizes the speech about the disagreement in Celtic, while Deila acknowledges that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he will turn it back again.
Hearts will fight with the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new strengths of January will disrupt the unity of the team.
Dons raise their advance over Celtic by 5 points
The penalty of the first half in the submission of ADAMA Rooney secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, making Dons a five-point advance between each other and Celtic.
Griffiths rejects discourse
This situation has triggered the discord in Celtic, which has been denied by Griffith, who insists that he and his colleagues do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparations for a match with the leaders of the Netherlands League.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think the players are delighted.
Lack of Scottish title rivalry is boring the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers Deputy and former Netherlands Deputy Ronald de Boer claims that the Netherlands football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax ambassador, said: "They no longer show the best of Celtic matches in the Netherlands, and why?"
There are no Rangers anymore.
The people here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
He talks about the old company.
They are talking about both teams together and they are just interested in it.
At the Old Company matches there is a great tension and not only people from Scotland watch these games.
I turn things back to the good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little cracked, but the Norwegian boss promised to turn things back to the good.
Malm's defeat and the subsequent defeat from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now runs to the top of the table with a five-point advance.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced a bad period and will rise again."
We want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current event.
We are the same, but we have to go on.
We really need Celtic’s support because it makes players much better.
Now it is very important to stay with you.
Warburton is worried about January’s reinforcements
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he has already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about the big shopping strength and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
Former head of Brentford says: "The ice-transition window is very different from that of the summer."
Players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season period to reside, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu's transitional goal suggests retirement
Attacker Swansea Michu, who was connected with Celtic in a transition window, suggested that after his contract expires, Swansea could retire.
The twenty-year-old shooter has been suffering from a sensitive neck for two years and failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight with SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was sent to the closet and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the arbitrator Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands behind his claims and states: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynecastle
The hardheaded Hibbe was strictly punished after he admitted to singing a song with a text aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident occurred in a bar in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
“It was a derby and it was a terrible moment,” the attacker said and continued, “I can safely say I won’t return to Tynecastle unless it’s in Celtic’s dress.”
The Council of Tannadica believes in Dundee United - Donelly management
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United council still believes in correcting the situation by current team management - but admits that the failure on the field has to end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We’ll prepare the boy again for action,” Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is pleased for the “bad victory” against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold against Hamilton Accies to succeed in getting the seventh league victory in a row and a five-point advance over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half in the submission of Adam Rooney.
McInnes says: "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of match."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged while UK's total unemployment rises
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scotland unemployment rate was 5.9 percent above the UK rate (5,5 percent), according to data from the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over the three-month period, the number of workers now stopped to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74,0 per cent over the quarter, a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has set the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we’ve been witnessing further improvement in the labour market and Scotland’s employment has grown, while unemployment has decreased.
Why I was a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will follow the murder of a man.
If that happens, and I hope that it doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in the exhibition gallery in the death room of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip who will be executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will witness his death.
The invitation I first received in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I begin to be afraid of it.
So why do I do it?
I accepted this invitation because I think it is a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
This would give me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow the executions in America and because there are often more requests than free seats, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalist seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is elected, he will follow the whole execution uninterestedly.
I can’t do that.
I will sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip and create a special bond to him through a month of calls and one two and a half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk together.
The prison administration claims that I can’t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won’t have a note block allowed and I won’t be able to record what I’ll see.
I will have to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the pet as he will like it, get access.
I complained of her.
She admitted that "this could formulate better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and even if he did, I’t listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the site.
He believes that if he dies, his case will help proceedings against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be on my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have created.
I will not repeat all the details.
I can’t say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of co-vinnace for the crime.
But I believe there is a great probability that he is innocent for the murder.
I definitely believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is bad.
It is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience, what it is to see the person I love, to die with unnecessary death.
Man escaped from Canning River after police hunt
Police officer Canning Vale remained dry after releasing the man from the Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrh that he will escape to the police did not come after he got into the thin water just a meter from a police officer who tried to unviolently persuade him to return to the shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in the incident that crossed to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping through the Canning River.
But he did not get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come for me'," Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Police officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn’t want to wet the uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic, police negotiations.”
“People sometimes try to do fun things when they flee,” Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins took a car into the hole to avoid the bus and tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were useless, but he inspired the local to start planning the biathlon of Ben Cousinse.
Peter Moody says the organizers have tried to spy him and threatens to end the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that against him they have a personal campaign with late cracking Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which for him on Wednesday was the last drop.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what’s best for the race and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarin’s positive cut on the kobalt, which he can’t explain.
He kissed his tongue about the accusations of spying for 18 months and didn’t want it to look like “dry grains.”
“I didn’t want to say anything about the fact that I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it’s going out of you all at once,” Moody said.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I’m going to go home and sleep well.
I want to go up with my head and make the owners think I do my best for them.
When they begin to think the opposite, then I should no longer be a coach.
I should then consider what I will do with my license.
Previously, Moody launched a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity department tried to spy him.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man – whom I’ll ask – and offered him a job in my stations for finding information about the things that are being done in my stations,” Moody told Racing.com.
They thought I was a fraudulent.
If so, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me they were completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current Chairman of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it becomes a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a couple of balls and arrange people outside the trainer’s position to take responsibility for what’s happening in this industry?
Is it bad for this industry?
Is I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people think that’s so.
Maybe I need to take my license and remove me away and I have no doubt that what I say now will provide them with material to think about.
But I got to a point when I no longer care about it, and I am sad about it.
It really disappointed me.
I will press them and put the burden on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The level of frustration of the coach increased with a long-term investigation due to the kobalt including the Lidari and recent scratching in it raised the feeling that he would "will watch his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the unsuccessful champion Black Caviar, described the treatment rule on the day of the race as "smiling" after the horses were applied to their legs of aluminum cover or blat, which is contrary to the rules.
It is contrary to the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
Someone of my team mistakenly applied a blat on his foot.
It could have been last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it could have happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the cover on the day of the race, to which the organizers have already opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules do not know anything about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
The Cobram driver who fled was arrested.
Police arrested a man who crashed a cyclist in Cobram on the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was transported airly to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping and helping the wounded driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself admitted to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be accused of non-stop in the accident, lack of assistance and other traffic offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable state in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Returns Attack to Rivals Due to Wrestling Claims
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, criticized the interventions of his players as a "planning plan" by two NRL favourite premiership.
Trent Robinson, the coach of Sydney Roosters, said that the judges allowed Storm players to "wrestlovat" his players during the controversial victory of the team in the qualification final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly covered note on Strorm after his team won the qualification final over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game a "preview" of the rugby league and according to him two from Queensland were not "too big" to wrestling.
Bellamy defended the interventions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-confidence because his team is criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeat from the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember that Trent Robinson would talk about wrestling when we were defeated 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the last year we have not changed anything from our defence system and techniques, in the last weeks we have only emphasized contact during the interventions, and this meant a turn for us.
Trent has been there for three years and obviously trains a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, which could be a little shock for him.
It’s funny how such things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennet's idea of "excellent football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the premiership in 2010 by playing "nude" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as our game, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne then said that he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game that seems to him abolishing, especially his young backups with their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now he wants all the teams to play his football style - but not every team has two backers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so such a style to play cannot.
It raises more self-confidence in me because they say such things because they are worried about fighting against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t even think about us when they got to the big matches.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the match Storm and Roosters fell more goals than in the match Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team's game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, but is it an exciting football?
Or are pauses and non-coring attempts that interesting?
I think that’s agenda.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a weekend break and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday evening in AAMI Park.
Serbian man receives $200,000 guarantee for drug charges
The man who was faced with a possible life imprisonment for holding 40 kilograms of cocaine, which was passed out of Queensland, received a guarantee of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of the five men who were arrested last month by the federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and dropped in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen during a meeting with the accused in the port during the morning and later met with them in the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential life sentence for possessing commercial quality cocaine, the lawyer Maksimovice defended that there was no evidence that he would possess the whole amount and that he could be in the cafe completely accidentally and innocently.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would flee.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said in court on Wednesday.
In the coronary case he lie to the police about where he lived.
His mother and grandfather, Maksimovice, offered a $200,000 guarantee for his release.
“After reading the two persons’ pleasant statements, it is clear that the $200,000 deposit is a real financial burden for them,” judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts themselves were obviously insufficient, because the accused did not come further to the court, he warned.
Maximovic has been granted a guarantee under the condition that he will give up both the Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police daily and will comply with the ban on departure from 18 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send images
The pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when she slept, then logged in to her on her online chat, where he had a lot of unpleasant photos of children sent him by another user.
The girl then turned and found that she missed the phone and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She passed through it and before warning her mother, she found annoying news.
Police involved and saw five photographs, then analytical computers found the address and discovered a "threatening" search on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was to "make pedophiles" on the internet before he "presumed he was a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal lawyer Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's addiction - he's dependent on the fear of people.
He acknowledged that the search on the computer was done by him, but he claims that he just wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and why he wanted to send another.
He said he did it to get them.
He claims he’s jumped over in drunk and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw unmoral images on her phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was heard and talked about how the accused used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls that looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, acknowledged guilty of filing a lawsuit concerning the receipt or provision of inappropriate images of children on June 14, last year, violated the conditions of the guarantee on January 25, and failed to be heard at the court on March 24, this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offenders, as he could argue by saying that there was "no fundamental sexual subtext in his act."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has delayed the sentence to October due to reporting social workers.
Hogg was granted guarantee in this case, but was held in detention before he was heard of other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe Speaks Bad in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was also damaged by the allegations of opposition lawmakers that they received anonymous threats of murder, which warned them of Mr. Mugabe's expulsion during his speech.
Last month he was kicked out and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with warning not to block Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
“The report comes from a number that doesn’t appear but is named ‘death’,” he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
He said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "threatened" about threats to parliamentarians.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce the number of jobs by 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancell 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructuring and saving the cost of business services of the company.
HP will later this year be divided into two companies listed on the stock market and will separate the computer and printer trade from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected decrease in the number of jobs will result in a change of approximately $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive and sustainable expenditure structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” says Meg Whitman, HP’s CEO and Chairman of the Board, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than today HP and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of stores that will help transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the emerging requirements of our customers worldwide.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion after the company's announcement and will be "focused on providing uncompetitive integrated technological solutions" to companies.
This will result in the division of the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which manufactures electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the Silicon Valley home."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to manage the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move of HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialized company has better results.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says the co-player must get behind the wounded Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere that it's still just September and, if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there's no reason for him not to play again on Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four other English games and, from the perspective of history, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is obviously uncertain.
The great disgrace of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after a neck injury and then returned to former form during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten your career,” Wenger says.
It is a wound that requires treatment.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not affect his neck or the injury he suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different wounds of Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years he has only played in 65 league matches of Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six out of eight seasons from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the wicked circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you get back after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win competition,” Wenger says.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I am sure that yes and he will have a career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, that is, Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to arrive.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for progress from the F group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches afterining the campaign of "unbeatable" last season.
The stadium was struck on Wednesday night by a 3.2° Richter earthquake.
It was the twentieth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned from the last season of the Champions League when he gave up against Monaco and remains a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first winning in the European Cup.
“This engagement is great,” says Wenger.
This has never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreams.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar shows in different shows is eye-to-looking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicide among young men under 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to solve this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked the year 2015 as the Man's Year, which aims to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
In the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not in depression, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents half a chance of developing mental problems.
But for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achieved first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on the style and not the content of the message, an immediate response is often preferred before a meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social state, all at the expense of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound influence on our mental health.
And as recently explained by one billionaire and game maker, money really won’t buy greater luck.
The beauty of the series Friends was for him the source of this idea.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that shine through friendly interactions.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all come from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify themselves with it, even though they mostly leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the programs that will emerge in my memory when I try to offer a longer-term balance mechanism.
It emphasizes the little moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsiders on the phone helps people in moments of desperation, but long-term support must come from closer, from a network of friends and family.
So if this weekend you are going to the FrendsFest organized by the Comedy Central station, why not take your friends to a glass to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked on the occasion of the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on the Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - a total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG remove Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuidim and Edinson Cavanim after shooting the goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored during his debut in the Champions League and helped PSG defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the report of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the Champions League with a final comfort victory 2-0 against Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and this PSG player sent French champions for victory, but then they threw a few chances until they finally increased their advance when Cavani scored the goal with the head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only focused on the qualification to the draw rounds, but on improving their journey to the quarterfinals they recorded in each of the previous 3 rounds.
But even though they gained three points, it was not the classic performance of the team Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasted before the goal and later was replaced against his home team and club, in which he began his famous career in 1999.
"In the Champions League it's not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, even though there are things we'll have to improve with the progress of the season," Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I’m sorry we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes to the PSG team, who at home held this weekend 2-2 remission with Bordeaux in League 1, but was shadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moves the PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he ran on the pass of Marc Verratti for the defense of Malma and with a beautiful end he sent the ball behind the back of Johan Wilanda to the remote corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected it to start the magnificent PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off and got into this phase, entered with 9 internationalists in the base composition and five defenders and two struck backers were a heavy rival.
But in addition to the Nikola Djurdjice missile, which just just passed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, much of it was not offered in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself was defraining for the benefit of the attack with bad recordings and bad finish, which was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he turned out much more suitable when he came to the preparation of the chances for his co-players and it was just from his recording when Di Maria sent a rotating shot that ended in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguay headline sent for the line the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him after the match from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could get out of the match, and only the excellent intervention of Wilanda from great proximity destroyed David Luiz's hopes, and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the switching Ezequiel Lavezzi was unrecognized at the end of the match.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played a Swedish league that is not at the same level.
Qualification matches are not enough.
A hat down to Paris.
It was an amazing match for them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion for sale of shares
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which was affected by the crash of commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing commodity prices falling as the slowdown of the Chinese economy reduces demand and brings shadows of destruction across the markets.
The issue of rights sent on Wednesday the Glencore stock price to the top on the London stock market in early morning shops.
The shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pounds on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent above.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion shares is part of wider plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which accumulated about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
Thus, 1.3 billion shares were released at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
China's concerns about prolonged growth obstructions dropped the price of iron mines by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
President Xi’s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing, where he visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his cousin Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will be held after the talks end.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to strengthen the mutual relations between the United States and China and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the disagreements between the two countries,” the report added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then will continue to New York for the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber spying and its increasing aggressiveness in the South China Sea waters.
As the refugee crisis broke down the Schengen space.
The emergency lights exploded by Germany have far from melting the European crew, but are already forcing the ship to change the course, the French newspaper Le Figaro wrote.
The European Union decided on Monday to address the issue of refugees in advance: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it enters the old continent – especially in Greece, rather than discuss the future allocation of refugees by quotas based on quantities that are increasingly distant to reality.
Six days after the European Commission Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to re-distribute 160,000 refugees, the Member States' internal ministers changed the priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who come already today and to solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen space.
“Effective management of the EU’s external borders is essential to managing migration,” the ministers said in a text discussed on Monday in Brussels.
After the common currency crisis, the EU finds that it is in danger in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power thus clearly shows that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
Austria and Slovakia agreed to this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also thinking about it, though with a different intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permitted under the Schengen rules.
The domino effect is visible, but the blind effect is visible.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of compulsory entrance checks in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed into the interior.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this in a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not a new thing, but it is being realised.
In Italy, according to informal statistics, two-thirds of newly arriving refugees have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that there will be no camps on its shoulders where refugees will gather on its behalf.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as much as it has arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overwhelmed camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It is an enormous hole.
Athens, which are still in financial disruption and are waiting for a new government, have placed their hands in the clay.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and is now the source of common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's committee promises that the introduction of the control points will take place as soon as possible, but does not specify any number or date.
"The challenges faced by Greece apply to the whole of Europe," the EU's internal ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
Therefore, it is about deploying the intervention teams of the European Border Control Agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum and strengthen the oversight of the islands.
“It will need adequate financial resources,” the text was submitted to the ministers to approve.
In terms of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the twenty-eight, however, has taken the question of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees to the second round, which was already set up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament in the beginning of the year and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland still don’t want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of twenty-eight.
as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which was already agreed in June during the busy EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven people were killed under the lavina in the Alps, including three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by a lavina in the French Alps.
The German nationality is the only woman who survived as the eight-member group affected.
Previously the media it was about Poland.
About a thirty-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a severe leg in the scalp area.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40 people.
“The rescue operation has ended, the bodies of the victims have also been transferred to Briancon to identify,” Hautes-Alpes prefect Pierre Besnard said.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area under the summit of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 meters.
“The narrow lavina was 250 meters wide and about a meter high,” rescue chief Nicolas Colombani said.
The eight-member group, according to him, had a huge amount of snow in a height of about 3,900 meters.
The meteorological service did not operate in the area due to bad weather.
Trpišovsky before the match with Braga: Finally true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovsky at his premiere in the cups managed to pass through the European League front round to the base group with the footballers of Liberce and is now pleased to enjoy the right Europe with the team.
Slovan at the start of the main stage of the competition welcomes the 2011 finalist Bragu and, according to the coach, wants to force her to play her style.
After all the nerves in the removal battles, when every goal and every situation could remove you on the way to the dream group, now we’re there and we’ll play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every incased goal, we can play our tactics and we’re not bound by just a double match.
"I'm looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before it was just qualification," Trpišovsky said at a press conference.
Braga is the top team.
It will be very active, have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent is likely to be harder because he doesn’t have such a name, but he has a player in his square, which I guess Manchester has scored three goals.
“It’s an excellent whole at the top team level,” Trpišovsky said.
But Braga is not a favourite.
We’re playing at home, so we’re not outside.
"I think we have shown in the home competition and in the pre-calls that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," the coach said, whose team lost from the eleven duels of this season only the introductory Super Cup in Plzni.
He believes that Liberec can also force Braze into his style.
We are waiting for a team that will be strong on the ball, while at the same time it is unusual for them disciplined.
They play from the 4-4-2 layout with a fast transition to the attack phase.
“It’s a very heavy opponent, we’ve discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the field,” Trpišovsky said.
We studied a lot of opponents in the pre-courses, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted our training.
"And we definitely want, even if it will be very challenging, to play according to our not," the coach added.
Student films dominate the Sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries registered their works for the 15th International Student Film Festival in Sand this year.
Four dozen of them, which a committee composed of students and teachers sent to the final, will be shown from 15 to 18 October in the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by the international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Each year, the festival has its special theme, which is derived from the festival sound.
This year it is a detective.
This year’s ceremonial evening director Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatrical creation.
“And of course, we also have to resolve the crime that was committed in our this year’s conspiracy,” Charvat said.
Visitors will see the selection of the most interesting from student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, for example the winner of the last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival, like every year, are preparing an accompanying program.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional player on didgeridoo Ondřej Smeykal, turbochanson group Let's?, playing band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by the graduate of the Sand Film School and the winner of prestigious awards, among which does not lack the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition approaches the atmosphere that ruled in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
On the conversation with the visitors will be the cameraman and documentary artist Martin Cech, the film The Cameraman with his music will accompany Gerhard Gruber and the sandy nations Brukner, Novotný and Hlach at the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný will baptize their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron of FAMO in Sand, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are its message that will continue to live.
“Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint links and film craft,” the spokesman said.
Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, take several job complaints at the same time, and thus get a job.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher Professional Film School in Sand.
Its founders, the spouses Vladana and Miloň Terčovi, organized the first year in 1997.
The sixth year was held once every two years.
In case of bankruptcy, insurance companies have to pay the claims of customers in full.
Insurance companies should pay the claims of customers when the travel agency fails in full.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the amended amendment to the Law on Business Conditions in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank warranty according to the proposal, which is intended to be assessed by the Senate.
Insurance companies disagree with the obligation to pay the claims of customers even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development on the adjustment insists on consumer protection.
The insurance companies have already threatened to terminate the insurance of travel agencies against the collapse when the novel will be paid.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to leave or leave abroad.
Local Development Minister Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not euro-comform.
The Constitutional Court has confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit.
“We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be realisable,” said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank warranty will not work because no one gives it unlimited.
“Travel agencies will have to stop or move their activities abroad,” Kalousek warned.
A member of the presidency of the Association of Czech travel agencies and agencies Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalouskovy concerns on the basis of an investigation among members of the CK disagreeed.
“Stop showing us the lobbying insurance companies,” he said.
The statements of the insurance companies are not considered relevant by Okamura, their official written statements in this sense, according to him, do not exist.
They say they will find out whether travel agencies will make a joint participation, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competitive Association of travel agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who talked about the cleaning of the stairs by the Czech travel agencies.
Travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” Fischer says.
The proposal for the release of the controversial passage has not been approved by the House.
Voytěch Filip (KSČM) did not come with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee due to alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Philip warned travel agencies that he said they could threaten consumers.
In view of the ruling of the Constitutional Court, the reporting party Martina Berdychová (ANO) withdrew its proposal to limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance performance will not cover the entire risk.
The new regulation will not initially propose a minimum of four million insurance limit for travel agencies offering air travel, and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus travel.
The limit remains at 30 percent of the planned sales from tour sales.
However, the limit of insurance will have to be such that, in case of bankruptcy, the travel agency will cover all claims of customers.
The regulation, even after the amendments, provides that travel agencies will have to specify which travel agency is organizing the trip for the sale of the trips.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, among other things, data on management and the number of trips.
The amendment approved by the public administration committee is also expected to be further regularly informed by insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them each month with data about the number of passengers and sold trips, the total price of the trips sold and the amount of advances and sales for trips and tickets.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfill any of the legal obligations toward the insurance company, it will invite it to make a correction or will be able to prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
The plan is to reform the financing of the mountainous services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the Mountain Service on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of government funds in the past year, a budgetary plan of expenditure and a prospect for the next two years.
According to the association, the proposer of the law did not think of the situation, what would happen if the insurance company dissolves the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to arrange the trips and the customers who bought the trips before the disclosure of the insurance, according to the association, will lose it.
The CK in such a case will suffer a significant loss and may even bankrupt, although its management was in good condition.
One of the options for travel agencies to deal with such a situation will be a claim to the state for compensation.
Another option will be going abroad and taking advantage of much more soft conditions abroad and on our market we will then act only as agencies, said association vice president Jan Papež.
The proposal of the amendment, though according to him, also contains an institution of bank guarantee, but so unthinkable that it cannot be implemented at all in practice, since the bank guarantee cannot sound on an unlimited amount.
According to the association, the change of the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Over the course of two years, the new EU directive will need to re-elaborate the whole law.
There are currently 942 active travel agencies operating in the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have terminated their activities.
The domestic travel agencies sell roads worth approximately 20 billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work on improving the humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after negotiations with the German Prime Minister.
It also called for the division of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member countries.
We need to help more to countries where refugees leave, or where they stay after they leave their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will meet for decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal could be greater financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organizations.
“The EU countries also support the German government in promoting the fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries,” Merkel said.
The country’s Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas is long-term rejected, among others, by the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke for accelerating asylum proceedings in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start with the integration of foreigners faster, the Prime Minister said.
According to him, it is also necessary that the majority of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees serves just to integrate those who have the opportunity to get asylum.
More teachers will be needed for the refugees to learn German.
This is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if refugees are able to integrate, they can become a benefit for us, he said.
Matt Damon Says Diversity in the Movie
Matt Damon faced the afroamhetic filmmaker Effie Brown during a diversity discussion with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday HBO episode of the Greenlight project, the actor in the series broke down when he emphasized the need for alternative views about the black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it by filming and not by showing,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted disgustingly with uncertainty and hew up "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martian came into broadcast.
Damon and Brown joined the well-known producer Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I would like to appeal people to think, no matter who the director is, how they will behave to the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that is a spider, which is packed by a white spider.
The producer of the Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon dismissed that their directing "will eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger over writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black girl in the room so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurt."
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweet and 4,000 characters since it was published.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is in the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national influence and pushed the lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminating practices against colorful people.
In February, singer Prince made insights on the movement while listing the nominations in the category Album of the Year during the Grammy Awards.
“The albums are still important,” he said.
Like books and black lives, the album is still important.
Recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the Fox News personality question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love,” the leaders said.
Damon was recently on the list of entertainers, producers and media mogul who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the appearance of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has received the invitation or has already met with the Pope is not clear.
The American Ninja Warrior has the first winner.
The professional mountain climber Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home a million dollars.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, no one of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men fought to the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb of more than 220 meters long wire.
Britten was the first to take a peak in a set limit and became the first competitor to overcome the 4 episodes in the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero overcome him for full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for newsE! News immediately after his harsh victory and it was known that he was still in shock from winning the main prize worth $1 million.
“It’s a wonderful feeling, I’ve never earned more than $10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his win.
So suddenly... I can’t imagine what it’s going to be now.”
Executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won’t get any reward despite becoming the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishes the trail the fastest.
“If more competitors participate in the track, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Although the earnings of the main win would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
“I don’t think he has hatred in me.
He is glad he has achieved what he has achieved.
He received a warm acceptance from the fans.
He is a great man and loves his family.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.”
Geoff said to me, “If there was someone who could defeat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will start filming in the spring of 2016.
Tiger from Detroit passed just close to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Tiger from Detroit, the second half of the season was not just a walk through the pink garden.
The Tiger, one of the best baseball teams, is now on the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just closely reversed their defeat when they defeated Minessot on Tuesday's match with a close score of 5-4 at Target Field.
The twins lost the chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Though only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so untouchable for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus said.
The Tiger Rider Alfredo Simon kept his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two exchanges and then took the next in the sixth and ninth exchanges.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 defeats and 3 circles.
It was his third successful game in the last nine matches.
“This year I want to end with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a match when you’re often sitting on the plate and therefore I want to get well into the game.”
The Tiger Fighter Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 rounds and his first drawn point since mid-August.
For Martinez it was the first three-point match since the last June game, in which he hit four times in the match against Seattle Mariners.
“It’s a good thing to do,” Ausmus said.
"He looked good at the training, he shot out significantly better and he managed to transfer it to the match."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh exchange, the Twins got the greatest chance to return to the game.
Byron Buxton won the exchange thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
The right polar Aaron Hicks gained a point thanks to the set palce and Simon scratched Brian Dozier before he was replaced by the left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy removed his only opponent, Mauer, and in front of him he had the ballmaker Miguel Sana, who shot the ball and rounded two goals and left behind the right-hand Drew VerHagen.
With two players on the goals and a chance to remise in the second turn, VerHagen managed to send the third meters over two goals.
Plouffe has already won 27 rounds over two goals this season and reigns the league tables.
Detroit held the ninth turn, Mauer gained two withdrawal points and Bruce Rondon seized a score of 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this right-wing outleted Sana to three excesses.
Detroit took advantage of the advantages and gained points in the game of Phila Hughes.
The tigers gained three circles in the first two exchanges against the surrender, who entered the game after a more than a month break due to the inflammation of the back muscles.
“I didn’t imagine a start like that,” Hughes said, “but during the third turn I felt that I was getting better.”
After resisting the blow in the first exchange, Hughes left one point to the second meter Ian Kinsler.
Two departure for the right polar J.D. Martinez brought to Victor Martinez, who was the first to turn all the goals.
Victor Martinez stopped his series 0-21.
The third meter Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was overwhelmed when he tried to get to the third time.
The Tigers added in the second exchange when the overheaders James McCann and the pollar Anthony Gose gained two and one points and the resulting table scored 3-0.
“It got us to the knees,” said Twin Managing Director Paul Molitor.
“He didn’t hit the ball very well, but he got it to the right place.”
Hughes, who won the number of overhead, ended in the third exchange without points and was replaced by the right-wing A.J. Achter.
Hughes scored three goals, won six shootings and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right Tiger shooter, ended the match with pain in the right arm.
He will be treated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's arm in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries due to stretched shoulder muscles since mid-August, is expected to enter the Wednesday match.
Sanchez will be replaced by the leftist Daniel Norris, who returns after the injury and will fight the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced with David Price, he has scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
He did not play since August 20 because of his muscle stretching.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third match at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands the Minnesota left overhead Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to strengthen growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is to reform governance on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investments and expertise and improving open policies," he said on the 16th meeting of the central leadership group for deepening the overall reform.
The promotion of opening up in the emerging reforms will provide new impulses and vitality, and will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approach to the market, the release of the policy of border controls, the support of public enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration residential system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programs.
This step is significant because it will provide the market with a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and make sure that the companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
China will also allow the border areas to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investments.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are funded from abroad and will provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for permission for permanent residence or a “green card,” thanks to the optimization of requirements and the simplification of the application process.
The provision of the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to the statement issued after the meeting.
There is a possibility that a new bed department will be established in the Karlovarsk region.
According to the deputy hejtman of the Karlovarski kraj Jakuba Pánika (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two district hospitals and two private hospitals in the province is sufficient and the partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of the individual hospitals.
There is also a possibility of extending care.
For example, in the department of the surgical department, one-day surgical centers could be established, where, according to the set concept, surgical fields that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on one-day surgery should be, it is not yet clear.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser center could be created with the possibility of laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the formation of an apalic center that would take care of patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological and resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility into the Island Hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovarsk region, is the bed of subsequent care, especially the bed of Long-term Patient Treatment (LDN), the capacity of which in Nejdka is insufficient and above all should be closely linked to the bed of acute care.
Part of this facility should work as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept is recommended.
The beds of subsequent care are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There could be abandoned buildings after centralization.
Lastly, in the Karlovarsk region there are no social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are a shortage throughout the Republic, so it could also serve for other countries as the so-called Alzheimer's Center.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should be prepared for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which the funds of European grants will be released.
“This is a bed that will follow to the sub-specialized care fields and will form a space for translation of patients after the procedure, for example, after cardiochirurgical, neurochirurgical, transplant or other procedure,” the regional concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the psychiatric care field.
