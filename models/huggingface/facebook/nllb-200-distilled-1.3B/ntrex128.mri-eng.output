The AMs of Wales were concerned that they looked like robots.
Some AMs are concerned about the idea of changing their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The protests over the change of the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament intensified.
AMs are all the more sensitive across the political spectrum when they are criticized.
One AM Reba was shocked to hear his band sounded like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp is a root, and pwp is a stem.
An AM Plaid  does not print the entire group, and other hypotheses have been proposed.
One Welsh Conservative said his party was open to party change, but the MWP was somewhat similar to the Muppet (cartoon).
In this context the pronunciation of the Welsh accent is similar to the pronunciation of the English accent of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently writing a draft law to introduce changes to the name, stated: The final decision on the name for the Members of the Assembly shall be made by the full membership.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act granted the assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of an international consultation on the proposals that widely supported calling the assembly the Welsh Assembly.
For the sake of the AM title, the Commission was preferred by the Members of Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but the MWP was the one most supported in the civil discussions.
The AMs are reportedly proposing several alternatives, but it may be difficult to find a common ground on the proposal of Executive Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to issue a draft law on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The law on reforms includes other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules for the exclusion of AMs and the creation of a committee system.
AMs have the final vote on the question of naming for themselves when they argue the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which had a separate territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's use of that name is a claim on its territory, and has long criticized its rejection of EU and NATO membership proposals.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum proposal to change the name, said he would not attend the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was the only cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Matthew's Bells are ringing in the churches in Harlem.
"In the old days, the elders said there was a parish church standing at each corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, both are gone.
He said he understood why the paramedics were not there.
He said that "people are different today".
Parks are no longer the gathering places for the community to frequent from time to time.
For churches, he is concerned that the money from property sales is not enough to make the leaders happy, especially since they have reverted to the way they were in the first place.
He argued that churches could be replaced by residential squares and apartment blocks that were crowded and did not help to protect the last refugees of the community.
He said that many of the people who bought apartments in these buildings were European and would soon stop following the closure of these churches as it seems that most of these people who moved into these apartments did not become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by European congregations before Harlem became a bustling city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original European Methodist congregation broke away in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of worshippers from a nearby area.
The White House held a black caucus under the auspices of John Howard Johnson, who ordered the removal of dealers from Route 125 who did not offer jobs or promote blacksmiths, a major street for trade in Harlem.
The building was damaged by fire in 1939, but when the parish was preparing to rebuild the building, they ordered a curtain to be erected.
Minister David Johnson, son of Papa Johnson and a rising star in St. Martin's, spoke of the cars as "the arrows of the poor".
The talent who played the flute in July had a different name: Cultural Heritage and Flute player.
University of Michigan scholar Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first ever piano in the world played by a virtuoso violinist, Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to a larger piano at Riverside Cathedral 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by Mr. Martin.
In recent months, St. Martin's has experienced difficult administrations involving architects and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the rectors of the cathedral and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The diocese - the governing body of the parish, from the lay-men - wrote to the bishop in July with concerns that the bishopric would pay the fees to the bishop, although the bishop did not include the architectural works and contracts awarded by the diocese.
Some in the parish complained about the lack of openness of the diocesan administration.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a pitchfork while scuba diving in California
A 13-year-old boy was hit and injured on Saturday by a pitchfork while scuba diving in California on the opening day of the scuba diving season, officials said.
This occurred just before 7 a.m. in the area adjacent to Beacons Beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San DIego that he and his friends were diving for half an hour on Saturday morning and then he heard the boy crying for help and then they and a crew went to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had first mistakenly thought he was a commoner for carrying a gold, but then realized the saying, "Don't fuck me!"
I'm going to be sick!
His abilities were completely exhausted, Hammel said upon seeing the boy.
"I called out to everyone to come out of the water: ""There's a leak in the water!"" Hammel continued.
He was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
It is unknown what kind of curve he had in his mouth.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media briefing that a bug had been spotted in the area weeks earlier, but that the preparation at the time was not a dangerous type of bug.
Giles also said that the wounds of the attack were severe upper body trauma.
Officers closed the beach entrance from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for search and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of ticks in the area, but most are not endangered.
Sainsbury's prepares to enter the UK luxury market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a steady stream of stores and skilled workers.
A major push into the £2.8 billion luxury market, which continues to grow and with the rise of the electronics and home appliances business, larger luxury cars will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out to more stores later this year if successful.
Both have invested in the luxury section with stores rubbing out the streets to fill in the gaps formerly used for televisions, radios and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of its beauty offerings to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees product lines gain more market share alongside similarly sized areas found in stores such as Boots.
The store is also suspending its cosmetics line to make most of the products more accessible to consumers - something that younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragance Shop is testing out areas exempted from Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
With online shopping and the move to daily snack shops in local stores, grocery stores have become less likely to attract people to them.
Mike Coupe, chairman of Sainsbury's, said retailers would be more similar to department stores as they compete with Aldi and Lidl's discount stores with greater service and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has since added Argos retail locations in more stores and re-introduced several Habitats since its purchase from two retail companies two years ago, and claims that these sales have increased food sales and profitability.
The store's earlier attempt to renovate its luxury and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended when problems arose over how to distribute the proceeds from drugstore drop-offs in its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy stores, for £125m, three years ago.
Lloyds played a key role in the plan, adding wealthy defense product brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said: "We have transformed the look of our luxury chains to improve the space for our customers.
We also invested in experienced staff to be available to offer advice.
Our species were designed to suit each need, and with the blinding and convenient locations we have become a truly beautiful destination that reinforces the old ways of commerce.
Peter Jones is retiring after Holly Willoughby was fired from a £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was forced to resign after TV presenter Holly Willoughby announced an £11 million settlement with his fashion business so that he could focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby was not available for their home-made furniture, and Truly was wealthy.
The pair's business relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow's company Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter posted her departure on Instagram.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones had recommended Holly Willoughby for a break from their lucrative live-action business just before the series was set - so that she could focus on her own big deals with Marks & Spence and ITV.
Some have said that Jones's "dismissive" statement by the television presenter's wife in a tough meeting at the Treasury at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Bukinghamshire - worth more than £1.5 million - made her unwilling to devote herself to their Truly furniture and furniture business.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business, and Willoughby's assets were thought to have doubled to £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, commented on Instagram about her departure, as Jones left Britain to visit one of her holiday homes.
Someone said: "Truly Holly is the real deal".
This was his long-term goal for the next twenty years.
Everyone was very surprised by his decision.
People were very concerned about the impact this had on the Tōrei, as the launch was imminent.
A warehouse filled with goods at Marolow Headquarters was ready to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is also one of Britain's most successful stars, will cost the business millions, due to massive investments in products ranging from kitchens and candles to clothing and home appliances, and possibly even a delay in launch.
This may have been a break in the friendship bond between them.
Willoughby, who has three children, and her boyfriend Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his girlfriend Tara Capp for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly alongside Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The four vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's film business.
Willoughby has joined as a spokesperson for M&S business and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A person close to Jones said that night, "We don't talk about his bus issues".
It's a hard story Once we fall in love with each other
He was also amused by criticism from the media for his comments that some consider inappropriate for the presidency and positive for the North Korean leader.
Why have President Trump's releases been so big?
Trump's harassment in his speech message reader.
I didn't give a damn.
He said Kim wanted to meet again after their first meeting in Singapore in June, when Trump said the summit had met the goal of denuclearizing North Korea.
But nuclear bomb disposal plans have been delayed.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top government spokesman Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the North did not see a "direct response" from the U.S. to North Korea's recent resurgent moves.
But instead, he said, the U.S. still has its own sexual harassment restrictions.
Trump looked better in his rally speech.
"We will work well with North Korea", he said.
We are not at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
So, we have a very specific design now.
He said his efforts had had a significant impact on improving relations with Kim - ending missile tests, helping to release prisoners and bringing back American drug cartels.
As it was, he supported his different approach to the relationship negotiations with Kim.
"Being president is easy, but trying to get 10,000 people out in this crowded lab with only about 200 people standing", Trump said, referring to the tragedy that lay ahead.
When a tsunami and tsunami washed away an island in Indonesia, many more died
After the Lombok earthquake, NGOs were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population remained homeless, no national emergency was declared, a preliminary requirement for requesting international assistance.
"But in many cases, they made it very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it was difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is not known if foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency department, said that Indonesian officials were analyzing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to support relief efforts.
Due to the constant influx of migrants into Indonesia, that nation is not particularly vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions.
Although wave shelters have been built in Aceh, these are not found in other tropical areas.
The failure to issue a tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning, was one reason people died.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult, regardless of the season.
Sequencing tasks become more difficult in natural disasters.
A hospital ship is on its way to Palu, Lombok to treat the victims of the storm, but it takes about three days to arrive at the new emergency.
President Joko Widodo's main objective of his election mandate is to improve Indonesia's railway infrastructure and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's government has long been plagued by a brief financial crisis and will attempt to be re-elected later that year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the sectarian problems in Indonesia, where members of the mainstream Islamic world are traditionally held to the more conservative traditions of the religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands more were displaced in the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs on the street, fighting with bandits, mobs and other armed gangs.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge made a strong effort to score and the scores were tied with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal in the 89th minute on a Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri and was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team finishing 1-0 behind.
He pushed the ball away to his left before he deflected the ball to the far side of the goal post.
The ball ran over the park and went to the right corner of the net.
Instead, the ball landed behind Kepa Arrzabalaga and hit the net.
"I try to get to that point, to get the ball and why players like Shaq always push the ball forward, and I try to make sure I have enough time", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I made one touch with the ball, and I just didn't think much about it then I was kicked out.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian defender Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' forward was hit by his opponent Mateo Kovacic in that half, then he quickly moved out of the corner and ran into the Liverpool side.
Kovacic then pressed and recovered the ball in the second half of the game.
And then he hit the ball out of bounds, to Hazard in the park.
Hazard missed the opponent and the ball ran into the opposing net by kicking a left foot behind Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll has risen to 832
Indonesia's death toll from the tsunami and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster department said on Sunday morning.
Several people are reported to have been trapped in the explosions of buildings that were knocked down by the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck on Friday, and then waves of up to 20 feet in height broke out, Suporo spokesman Purwo Nugroho said in a detailed statement.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was completely flooded with debris from the destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of assaulting a vaccinated woman
An investigation into the break-in has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman, 44, was found at 7.55am with injuries at John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of rape.
Police are asking people in the area who may have seen or heard this to come forward.
Deputy Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would ask anyone at the John Street site in Birkenhead who has seen or heard of a violent incident to contact me".
I also ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have video on camera to contact me as they may have information that may be important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has concluded that the woman found dead was from Birkenhead and was found in a house.
This afternoon people who they believe were friends of the woman came to the scene to ask about where she was seen this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have said they are continuing to inform the family of the arrested.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews is trying to get back to his apartment but police say no one is allowed to leave or enter the building.
He was shocked to hear about the trouble that had occurred.
Residents are advised of the number of hours remaining and may be allowed in.
A police officer was heard talking to a man about a crime scene all over the place.
A woman came there and she was crying.
He was like, "This is really crazy",
At 2pm two police cars were in the restricted area and another car was outside.
A number of officers were stationed in the reserve to monitor the residential quarters.
Recipients of the information should contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention the blog 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell by Parliament is a recent monument that has been the subject of controversy.
It seems likely that he was, like the Taliban, deeply influenced by the heritage and beliefs of England and its Puritan allies.
But the Cromwell Society contends that Mr. Crick's thinking is "a work of fiction" and that he is trying to exploit history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace will no doubt be a flashpoint in the current debates over the abolition of statues".
Cromwell did not order or carry out the earlier acts of idolatry in the English civil wars.
Another Cromwell may have been offered for the alternative works of his grandfather Thomas from the previous century.
Sir William Hamlet Thornecroft's most brilliant descriptions are a testament to 19th-century thought, and in the work of historians many believed it was still important to expand.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "It is the opinion of many, especially more in the latter part of the 19th century than it is today, that Cromwell was a parliamentarian from an outsider perspective, especially from a patriot".
This is an ongoing historical debate about whether the explanation is too accurate.
Most notably because of the wars in the mid-17th century that shaped the development of our nation, Cromwell is known as a man who stood on the side of that argument.
His achievements as a Guardian Role should be celebrated and remembered.
Pig Killed a Chinese Farmer
A farmer was killed by a pig in a market in central China, according to media reports.
The man, whose only surname is Yuan, was identified as Yuan when he was found dead with his leg amputated and his whole body covered in blood at a pig market in Liupanshui province in Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have traveled with his relative from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his relative found him dead, with a hole in the nearby pigsty.
He said his pigs had a lot of white spots in the yard and blood in his mouth.
A temporary house assessment confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer, the report said.
My relative's legs were all bloody and numb", said the relative, whose last name is Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.4.40 am on Tuesday feeding his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal he killed was neither Yuan nor his relative.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Legend has it that Yuan's family and market powers are preparing for the parliament for his death.
Although this is highly unusual, some pig traits have been previously observed to infect humans.
In 2016, a woman and her boyfriend were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer was hit by a 650-pound pig on his truck and his wife had to come and drive the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive animals but that hearing blood is like "squealing".
Pigs are already playing.
It's a different kind of kinki, a different kind of mutt... it doesn't bother you.
What you have to do is respect what you have to do", he says.
The debate has fed into U.S. concerns since the departures of Julio Rosa.
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is expected to bring flooding rains across northern Mexico as well as the U.S. mainland in the coming days.
Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, had winds of 85 mph as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and was 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The prediction is that Rosa's orbit will move to Sunday.
However, a storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa moves into the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical depression it begins to push the deep northwest moisture out into the U.S. coast.
Rosa will produce up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The quake is caused by a combination of humidity and dust approaching the Equator in the coming days.
In the area, dangerous flash flooding can occur due to 1 to 4 inches of rain, moving debris and possible desert flooding.
2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas can occur in deep snow moisture, especially in areas of northern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in some areas of the State, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding and worsening conditions may occur due to the spread of the meteorological phenomenon.
Never go into the desert below when the forecast is for heavy rain.
Water may flow in a stream through the bubbles, and the vapor gases and dust flow through the vents.
A storm warning will be issued in some areas of the Southern California coast as the storm approaches.
Semi-annual rainfall may occur, which can cause minor mudflows and mud flats.
This is the region's first rainfall for the rainy season.
Some heavy rainfall will approach Arizona as early as Sunday night and as late as Monday, and rainfall will be widespread in some areas on Monday and Tuesday nights.
The quiz will be broadcast on Four Corners as a podcast on Wednesday night.
Temperatures will vary greatly in the spring across the U.S. as the lower Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics will remain warm.
Sometimes temperatures vary greatly in different regions.
A prime example of the large temperature differences between the U.S. and the U.K. would be on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20-degrees.
In the coming days, the humid summer temperatures will need to grow and expand further.
Forecasts for much of the central and eastern U.S. are for warm early November with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to the Arctic.
New York City may have as many as 80 units as the City of New York, which is about 10 more than the average.
Our long-term forecast points to high probabilities for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of next November.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched the identifying evidence of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who filed the 1980s sexual assault charges against him, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
However, political turmoil continued, and media interrupted regular shows for a surprise broadcast on Friday: an agreement was reached by Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct a one-on-one investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was very confident that Kavanaugh had beaten him while he was drunk and tried to strip him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his eulogy that he was absolutely convinced that such a situation did not occur.
Nielsen reported that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not yet available for other networks that aired them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often had difficulty measuring the number of people watching in the office.
To be clear, that audience size is equivalent to a limited-overs game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel had a larger audience, and opinion poll witnesses strongly supported Kavanaugh's impeachment, with an average audience of 5.69 million during the entire day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52, Nielsen said.
The power of the law is still strong after the judgment.
Flake was the main character in the Friday show.
After the office of the Republican politician who said he would vote for Kavanaugh issued a statement, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being intercepted by protesters as he stepped into an elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stared downward for a long time as he was vomiting, which was prominently shown on CNN.
"Here I am standing before you", said one woman.
Is he really speaking to the island?
He was told, "You have rights but women don't".
Flake said his office issued a statement with the key, before the elevator closed, which gave more details of the committee's decision.
Cable networks and media reported in the hours afterward that the Judiciary Committee was set to vote to count Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate for election.
But Flake said he would only vote on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations of a suspected serial killer next week, which is being threatened by the Democratic minority.
Flake was somewhat influenced in conversations with his colleague, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and other later jurors, Flake issued his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was found that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without a referendum.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May condemned accusations that her opponents were "politically active" for Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May denounced accusations against her opponents of her plans to leave the European Union that they are "politically manipulating" Britain's past and ignoring the nation's life in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the front-page one, where his former foreign minister Boris Johnson is discussing his Brexit plan called Chequers, he says the idea that Britain and the EU should collect their taxes on imports is "very ridiculous".
Wayde SIms shooting: Police charge Dyteon Simpson with LSU player's death
Police arrested a defendant for the stabbing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and is currently in custody on a second-degree felony charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and Sims claimed to have lost his ammunition in the fight.
Police were able to identify the suspects from the scene and Simpson's DNA was found on top, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to killing Wayde by shooting him.
His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Medical Examiner issued an initial report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was due to exposure to asbestos and lead.
The department extends its thanks to the Louisiana State Police Crime Scene Investigation Unit, the local parliamentary crime lab, Southern University police officers and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that captured the crime.
LSU head coach Joe Alleva thanked the police for their "firm efforts to enforce the law".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch guard grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game that year.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was in a dark place and was in the dark because of Wayde's death.
"This is what makes you always so anxious", Wade says.
The volcano shoots ash into Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the northern residential areas of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned people in Mexico on Saturday not to go near the volcano after hearing of two volcanic eruptions, and 183 explosions and ash were registered in 24 hours.
The center tracks and monitors various noises and noise.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering old car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Archaeologists have found more volcanic activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital's epicenter since a 7.1 magnitude quake shook Mexico City in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatist protesters clash before the anniversary of the independence election.
Six people were arrested by law enforcement in Barcelona on Saturday following clashes between pro-independence protesters and border police, and as thousands of people rallied to protest circles to mark the anniversary of Catalonia's separatist vote for independence.
When a group of highly independent pedestrians were driven away by police as they threw checks at police and dust paints, dark dust settled on the streets, which were often crowded with tourists.
Fighting broke out later and police used their batons to suppress the fighting.
For a very long time, the autonomist groups have been chanting No forgetting, no forgiveness and pushing back against the unionists who are chanting Long live Spain.
Twelve people were treated for minor injuries from the blasts, local media reported.
Concerns remain high in the region seeking independence a year after the 1 November coup, which was declared illegal by Madrid but intensified by the pro-independence movement of Catalans.
Voters turned out to be too independent, although only a small minority voted and most opponents abstained.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to disrupt voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The ultra-independent protest group stayed overnight on Friday night to avoid protests and to support the police.
The pirates continued but died trying to go another way.
According to Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who visited the autonomous region with his girlfriend, the reality is that Catalonia will lose their autonomy.
THAT year was a very exciting time for us.
I saw my parents' tears flowing from joy that they were eligible to vote, but we are in trouble now", she said.
Although the uprising was significant in the local protests of that December, the Catalan independence parties found it difficult to make further progress in this as many of their leaders had committed suicide and were in prison awaiting trial for their planning of the coup and declaration of independence.
According to Joan Puig, 42, a mechanic who recorded the protest via his phone in support of the police, the clashes were monitored by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting heavier", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would stand in the European Parliament elections later that year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to counter the decline of democratic values and the Spanish government's assumptions", he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three people, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested by law enforcement after a house was broken into in Londonberry.
This incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Tuesday at around 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bon Blemmings reports that the cats and the house were abused.
A bolt to the wheel may have been thrown in such a situation.
Menga's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Livingston won Dolly Menga's first goal
Rangers were all but stunned when Livingston, who had risen from the bottom, suffered the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in his 18 games as manager at the Ibrox-based club.
Dolly Menga scored the difference and Gary Holt's side moved into second place alongside Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have yet to win away from home in the Premiership this season and are due to face Hearts on Sunday, who are 8 points behind.
Prior to that, Rapid Vienna were facing Rangers in the Europa League on Tuesday.
However, Livingston has now gone six games unbeaten in the division, and head coach Holt has not lost since he replaced Kenny Millar that month.
Some of Livingston's opportunities were not suitable for disabled visitors.
Holt's team was usually ahead before the attack, and their straight kicks made it difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson was broken but missed his kick before the kicks, then Alan Lithgow's kick was intercepted after he attempted to kick the ball from a kick by Craig Halkett in front of the kicks.
The club took years to allow Rangers to play in front of them on the understanding that they would be disturbed by the visitors from the preparation areas.
And this is how they got the idea.
Rangers sent a penalty kick and opened up against Livingston, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to free Menga, who took the ball and kicked it out of the middle of the park.
Up until that point, when Rangers had the ball mostly they had difficulty getting into the backfield of the goal, Liam Kelly ended up not being a major problem.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Kelly struggled to defend the ball from Alfredo Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers' opponent Allan McGregor's feet, ending Lithgow's wide kick from another Livingston equaliser.
Livingston's passes continued to come into play with the defense continuing to run, and penalty calls were ignored - after Halkett's rushing to Glenn Middleton's pass, and one for a handed pass of the ball.
Livingston's miracle - analysis
Alasdair Lamont and BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's play with the hero was spectacular.
They are evil, wherever they come from, and always exceed expectations.
Their playing style and players have changed dramatically since returning to the top flight, but Holt will be appreciated for his integration from the team since his arrival.
He had many firsts.
Captain Halkett was extremely strong, leading a very efficient defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall in a constant state of shock throughout the game.
However, Rangers have no fanatical spirit.
They were nowhere near the heights they had risen to under Gerrard.
Their last kicks were a failure - they only missed the penalty shoot-out once - and this, for what it's worth, was a shock for Rangers, who were in the middle of the pack.
Erdogan's decision-making spirit in Cologne was different.
Thunder and thunderstorms occurred on Saturday (September 29) at a meeting of German and German leaders for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the visit of Turkish President Erdogan to Germany - the aim of which is to re-establish relations between NATO allies.
They were concerned about issues, such as human rights, freedom of the media and Korukoru's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new embassy there.
It is home to the largest ethnic Korukoru population outside Korukoru.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the police station, but many protesters still made it to nearby areas to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's critics - many of them Kurds - expressed their opinions, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's efforts to drive him out of the country.
The concentric circles reflect the division of a ruler who is declared a prince by some German nobles and is recommended as a noble by others.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist killed in collision with a car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Deptford, on the city's west side, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
This accident occurred after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Street, about a mile from the Saturday crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were looking for the man and informing his family.
Roads are closed and buses are sent through alternative routes and motorists are instructed not to pass through.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured by rioters
Six officers were injured in a collision at a male correctional facility, Prison Police said.
The incident broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist officers have been called in to remedy the situation, including eight prisoners in a single cell.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries there.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Advanced prison staff have been deployed to remedy a long-running problem at HMP Longo Lartin.
Six employees were treated.
We do not condone violence in prisons, and violent offenders are handed over to the police, who may end up spending longer in prison.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates and is home to some of the worst atrocities.
In June, it was reported that the prison's governor had received treatment after an inmate exploded.
Late in November of that year intelligence officers were sent to the prison to correct a major problem that had been caused by workers being hit by ballistic missiles.
Hurricane Rosa destroys Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and wild flood (may result in flooding)
It is very unusual to see a tropical cyclone in Arizona, but one is likely to occur early in the week as the remainder of Hurricane Rosa's strength moves away from the Desert to the Gulf, causing flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona as well as southern and eastern Nevada, the California and Utah border, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's trail usually goes straight through Phoenix as the Winds, closing in on a rainy Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said that in a single episode of only ten tornadoes that maintained a tornado or volcano-like state within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ equator.
The National Hurricane Center forecast 2 to 4 inches of rain, with averages of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert to the Pacific include the Rockies and Great Basin are typically 1 to 2 inches here, with extreme sizes reaching up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of flash flooding, Rosa's showers may be a relief as the weather slows.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of these rains are favorable as the tropical conditions are currently affecting the Tropics.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is under severe drought conditions, the second highest level, weather.com reports.
First, the Rosa River trail runs along the coast of Baja California in the Gulf of Mexico.
Rosa was 385 miles, continuing to peak strongly on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and cruising at 12 miles per hour.
The depression is associated with warmer waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it is declining more rapidly.
So, the storm is expected to reach Mexico with a strong tropical storm as early as Monday afternoon or late at night.
Rainfall may be very heavy in some parts of Mexico, posing a risk of severe flooding.
Rainfall is forecast to range from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to western Sonora, and up to 10 inches is possible, weather.com reports.
Rosa then traveled through Mexico as a tropical storm that tracked as far as the Arizona border in the early hours of the Tropical Storm as a tropical storm, and then traveled through Arizona to southern Utah on the night of the Tropical Storm.
The greatest risk expected from Rosa or its remnants is the extreme heat in Baja California, western Sonora and the U.S. Central Coast, the National Hurricane Center said.
The expectation is that the sudden flooding and mudslides that are predicted from these will pose a threat to human life in deserts and erosion in mountains.
Midsomer Norton massacre: Four arrested for attempted rape
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to rape a 16-year-old boy found with defiant statuses in Somerset.
The teenage male was found lying in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was admitted to the hospital, in critical condition.
Police said the 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested late on Wednesday in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area.
Police are asking those who may have cellphone videos of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh hurt him by Democratic Party anger
"If Judge Kavanaugh is elected, he is voting to reject the Democratic Party's unkind and hateful actions", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said of Kanaugh that he was "a true fan of the Democratic Party and the anger" throughout the impeachment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Tuesday that he was aggressively and emotionally critical of Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she had been a virgin for many years to catch them as teenagers.
Ford also presented the verdict for his conviction.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance and quality and confidence that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most advanced legal minds of our time, a legal expert with a high level of public service", he told West Virginia supporters.
The President spoke privately about Kavanaugh's impeachment and also spoke about the importance of Republicans coming out to vote in the midterm elections.
It is five weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
It's not that I don't run, but I'm really running", she says.
That's why I'm everywhere I go for great candidates.
Trump urged Democrats not to engage in protests and protests.
The first major legislative vote on the Senate floor for Kavanaugh's impeachment is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the floods and mudslides in Indonesia, and the number is rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them quickly after massive waves of violent and violent flooding hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration in the heart of the city of Palu on Friday when massive waves of six meters (18 feet) high hit in the evening, and many were threatened with death and destroyed everything in their path.
The tidal wave was followed by a 7.5 magnitude tornado.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people were still doing their jobs in the heartland and did not immediately turn to running and especially to win", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation department, said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"Not only did the tidal wave hit but it also pulled cars, trees, houses, everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tidal wave came from the sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tidal wave and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
In satellite images released by the disaster department, several buildings and shops were found to be destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a barracks surrounded by water.
The riots continued after the city was evacuated on Saturday.
The blasts were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released from the massive explosion on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the geology of the city, it is at the end of a long, narrow channel, which may have increased the amount of tidal wave, its key.
Nugroho has a detailed account of the attacks and says that thousands of homes, hospitals, tourist shopping areas and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the detainees found trapped under the explosions of the buildings, and further claims that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said there were more likely to be deaths and injuries along the coast 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, and that this area is closer to the bottom of the canyon.
Communications have been severely disrupted with no information about communications from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
"This is a very dangerous situation, but it could be worse", he said.
The department was heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing Palu that a wave of tear gas had attacked, although officials said the waves arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In handshake videos shared on social media, a person on the upper floor could be heard shouting to alert people of a sudden wave of thunder that was coming towards people on the street below.
In a short time the water broke up and houses and vehicles were quickly evacuated.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the video.
Power was cut off by the storm and tidal wave, and the transmission line in Palu was severed making it difficult for authorities to organize rescue operations.
The military has begun a massive network of cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the settlers are in dire need of food and other fuel.
The city's airport has reopened for rescue operations only and will remain closed until next November.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the protests on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian survivors has exceeded 800.
It was very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the town of Palu, the staff, who were under lockdown on the courtyard of their office, passed through restricted areas as they walked, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said they saw many houses that were destroyed", he said.
It was very bad.
When relief groups began to carry out rescue operations, some complained that some highly skilled foreign aid workers were being prevented from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, deposits and personnel can only be allowed to enter if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet been done.
"The local emergency level is currently at its highest", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says that this is a national emergency, it can open to international assistance but there is no solution to this.
On the second night in Palu after the storm and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing remained elated to see the miracles seen in the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from a cotton mill.
On Sunday, a woman was released from confinement under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesia national fencing team, trained the two missing fencers for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Others held the Long-History, including Mr. Mandagi, his pupil.
"Because I am a leader in the food industry, I have my own emotional function", she says.
Mr. Gendon said that, in the hours following the news of the Long Beach Highway disaster among the gay community, he had been trying hard to send WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants, in a heartfelt protest.
However, there is only one kiwi symbol, not two blue symbols.
"As far as I know, that means the messages were not sent", he said.
The bankers withdraw $26,750 when they fill an ATM in Newport on the Levee
The suspects on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee while he was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a media release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had cleared the ATM at the casino and was preparing to cash in more, Det. Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was waiting, another man ran after Brink's employee and robbed a bank of cash for release.
Witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, the report said, but police did not say how many people had entered.
Those who know who they are should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper-singer has changed his name to Ye
Rapper-singer Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: Formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known as Ye for a long time and used this name as the title for her eighth studio album, released in June.
This change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live and was to prepare her for the release of her new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who took a break from the show for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
In addition to the pronouncement of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the name has religious significance to him.
"I believe that ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said this year, discussing his album with radio host Big Boy.
So you and I, we are yours, we are ours.
From Kanye, which means one, to Ye - which represents our good, our bad, our ugly, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He was one of several famous blacksmiths to change his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P.Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, uses his name with or without hyphenation and capitalization.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to allow the military to attack civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed not to use force to attack the population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the student riots.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that the military would never be used to suppress the Mexican people.
The military stormed a peaceful march in the square on November 2, 1968, more than 300 people were displaced by the uprising of left-wing student movements across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support Mexico's youth by offering monthly stipends to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that youths are becoming more likely to turn to crime as a result of unemployment and lack of access to education.
The U.S. should double A.I. funding
As China's artificial intelligence activities increase, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that area, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These claims come after statements by various parts of the U.S. government about AI, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
However, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 AI innovation leader by 2030.
"The second round of AI research funding is a good start, as other countries are lagging behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next opportunity in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding will also double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he developed an AI system that pushed America's highest Othello player, and later became a chairman at Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee recalled past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would help to identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers generally need to work harder to get the patches, Lee said.
"It's not that China is taking away basic education skills; it's foreign institutions", Lee said.
Google, Google and other tech companies have offered jobs to students from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes to immigration policies would also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be given to PhDs in AI", he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Zero Intellectual Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to those in academic pursuits similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
This year the U.S. Defense Department established a Joint Center for Cold War Intelligence from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Cold War Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, work on U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for the Criminal Minds has not been moved for several months.
The people of Macedonia have voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the island or not
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would end the transition period with Greece having blocked membership bids to the European Union and NATO.
Greece claims a province called Macedonia, which the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and which has prevented their accession to NATO and the EU.
An agreement was reached between the two states that the new name would be adopted, but opponents of unification claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's main Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not vote in the election, and due to a presidential decree it is unknown if the minimum voter turnout of 50 required for the election to take place will be reached.
The question on the ballot paper is: Do you support membership in NATO and EU and agree to an agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price of trying to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of the Iron Curtain.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union when it is safer for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not bound by the constitution, many members of parliament have said they would abide by the results of the election to make it official.
A two-thirds majority of parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of those who voted cast ballots, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children because Europe is the place for us", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast their ballot for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name to open the door to joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a mini stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and set up a pedestrian bench in front of the tents set up by those who were to cast ballots.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are willing to join by raising our standards rather than by offering services", Kavadarkov said.
We are a weak people, but we have power.
If they don't want us and Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian alliance.
Prime Minister Zaev says that by joining NATO Macedonia will receive much needed investments and the unemployment rate is about 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will support it as more than 80 percent of our countrymen support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after submitting his vote.
He argued that the solution to the problem of the future is to define our future.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the election - below the required threshold.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 percent of voters voted on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they were voting yes.
To make the election a success, the electorate must be 50 percent and one-third.
If the election fails it will be the first major defeat in the policy of the post-Western government since it took office in May of that year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes a bold move through Brighton's wide receiver barrier to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling both hit the Brighton goal in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the net at the start of the play-off period.
He struggled to get through the three Brighton blocks, before breaking into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed a defender before kicking others at the Brighton Park end.
He then hit the ball to his left, Sterling.
The England captain's first goal was to return the ball in the park to Aguero and kick the ball with his right foot to pass Mathew Ryan's tackle to the right of the net.
"Aguero has trouble with his feet", CIty manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky he was in the moment.
However, Sterling was the only one to put the Blues ahead of the first in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in the Brighton side in that game.
He delivered a superb pass to left field against Leroy Sane.
Sane made a good pass before giving Sterling the next shot.
The Red Devils' captain threw the ball into the net just before it came out.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to disrupt the game against the Rockies
Once the Nationals had lost their place in the playoffs, there was no point in starting over.
Scherzer's rival teams would like to play the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies can still make the playoffs and they are ahead by one game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies took a second-place finish at least, winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win their division for the first time.
"Even though the game was not a success, it was a great atmosphere here in Denver because of the weather and the other team was playing at a very high level that I had not experienced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start, but rumor has it that Scherzer will be the starter in that situation.
This was Scherzer's 34th start, and he only had practice on Tuesday and he only pitched his final day on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this year.
Trump gathers in West Virginia
The President spoke privately about the situation surrounding his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and also spoke about the importance of Republicans increasing their votes in midterm elections.
All our jobs are at risk in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our world.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm running everywhere to fight for the best candidates", he said.
Trump continues, "You see this angry, marginalised group, the Democrats, who are obviously involved right now.
When they end up trying to take over anyway, you see anger and resentment.
They don't care who hurts them, they just go for it to get power and independence, and that's what they want, absolute power and independence, so we have to try".
Democrats are trying to oppose and block.
"Well, you see four days have changed", he said, "and he talks about Democrats being angry and angry and angry and angry and angry".
He was referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee ordering Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name and removing her from office.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you submit the article?
And why?
No, and no, no, no - the body language was not good - all the violent physical language I've ever seen.
Labour has lost the general ideological group.
Doctors don't like people who talk about their feelings
When the founders of Momentum in my own group voted to make me mad, it was no surprise.
Well, I am one of the Labour MPs now to say I am not needed - just for expressing our views.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan felt the same way as she strongly condemned the abuses of Jews.
As for me, the Conservative Party criticized me for criticizing Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of a tax-free economic policy, for national security, for Europe, that is, Jeremy argued for the same reasons as other former leaders.
The reading for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that we wanted the meetings to be open and productive.
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP for the constituency, GC meetings were held on Friday nights.
But today, the spirit of the meetings is not the same, and the promise of more liberal politics is more easily forgotten than it was in the beginning.
It is now clear that different views are not accepted in the Labour party and that each view is criticized as being in conflict with the party leadership.
This started immediately after Jeremy took over as leader, when some of my friends who had mistakenly hoped that we shared political views would change my mind and pursue causes I had never supported - whether for national security or for the single market for the EU.
When I talk to the mayor - and I end up with no idea what I'm talking about - the comments on social media about the membership exemption, the criticism, the ridicule of the centre-right politics, tell me that I have no place in the Labour Party.
Finally, it is not uncommon.
I mean, I know I'm luckier than my friends because the vaccines are about me being politically active.
I admire the professionalism and perseverance of those friends who are pressured by racist and anti-humanist slurs every day but do not bow.
One of the most obscure aspects of this political era is the extent of tolerant capitalism.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should embrace a culture of big breathing.
It is natural that we should not accept general ideas, and that after each unsupported proposition or change in the selection rules the group becomes narrower.
I have received a lot of advice in these two years that I should kneel down, not talk too much, and if I do, be fine.
But that is not why I got involved in politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago when I was at school, and following this up with the Thatcher government's lack of attention and my class becoming increasingly fragmented, I have been seeking a recommendation to improve public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I did not hide my politics, even in the last election.
It was obvious that no one in Nottingham East was unsure about my political views and where I was in conflict with the current leaders.
To those of you who celebrated the Brexit on Friday, my only comment as the nation faces Brexit that is hurting homes, businesses and our public services, I don't see why there is a need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberal Party.
But my final word is not to Nottingham Momentum, to the people of my constituency, whether Labour or not: I will stand by my pledge to work for you and my pledge despite the threatening words to absolve me from standing for the party or the political situation that I will not give up what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is in first place and has never lost
Two goals before the end tied the final scores, but there was no doubt Ayr would have to win in the Tennents Premiership games of the most exciting day.
They are currently on the podium and are the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, their better training and their ability to take chances makes the home-field advantage, and coach Peter Murchie should be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far and have never lost, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they handled the opportunities better than we did".
Ayr came on before Grant Anderson scored in the 14th minute, and Frazier Climo's kickoff passed, but a yellow card to Scotland player Rory Hughes, given by the Warriors for this game, gave Jason Baggot a shot but did not score.
Ayr scored more points with a penalty kick from Climo just before halftime, which he scored and then crossed the line with a single-ball kick to make Ayr 17-5 in halftime.
But Melrose started well in the second half with a Patrick Anderson goal, which Baggot passed with a kick, narrowing the gap to five points.
The game was delayed for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off, and from the start Ayr progressed with a goal to Stafford McDowall, who passed Climo the kick.
Blair Macpherson's winger receives a yellow card, Melrose receives another, and Bruce Colvine's kickoff is not passed, after a hard-fought period.
The home side came back, but when a yellow card was issued to Struan Huchinson for knocking out Climo without a ball, from the penalty area, MacPherson scored from behind Ayr's goal.
Climo's kickoff was a knockout, as it was just after the start of the second half, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstong's boxing family and pressed Gregor Henry to score the fifth goal for the home side.
The star of Still Game seems to be ready for a new career path in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry soon after his name is spotted on a licensed catering company.
He was 56 and hosted Jack Jarvis's BBC hit show, co-writing and co-producing alongside his longtime keyboardist Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the downloadable show lineup would be the last of the show, and Kiernan appears to be preparing for his world after Craiglang.
According to official records, he was the chairman of Adriftmorn Limited.
The witness did not wish to comment on the message, but a person from the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to get involved in the fast food restaurant industry.

The soldiers are guarding a coal mine in La Paz.
A green flag flies over public buildings.
Tropical centers from the Titicaca Trench to the Amazon have been covered with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
Throughout rural Bolivia, memories of the lost courage of Chileans in a major 19th-century war - and a great desire to re-establish navigation in the Pacific - are still alive.
Expectations are high now, as Bolivia awaits the international court's decision on November 1 after five years of elections.
"Bolívia is moving forward, with a united spirit, and indeed hopes for a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian representative.
Many Bolivians watched the ICH decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the referendum in The Hague would fall on the side of Bolivia's claim that - after intense negotiations - Chile is obliged to ensure that Bolivia qualifies for a diplomatic exit to the sea.
Monday's decision has many implications for Evo Morales, the country's president - he will be running for re-election later that year.
"It was almost back to the Pacific", he said at the end of Herodotus.
But some analysts believe the court may not have granted Poland's request - concluding that things might not have been much different if they had been granted.
The UN body in Jordan has no authority to release Chilean lands, and has also stated that no outcome of the talks will be determined.
As the ICJ's decision comes only six months after the final arguments were filed, this case represents a difficult one, says Paz Zárate, an international legal expert from Chile.
And it may not have supported the Bolivian cause, but it may have been affected by past wars.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken up by the Bolivian government", Zárate said.
Chile's good sense has been lost by Morales' provocative remarks, he alleged.
Bolivia and Chile had a period of constant dialogue, but it was difficult to manage such talks after this.
The two countries have not granted intergovernmental status to their respective countries since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to the Hague, criticized the court's decision, considering it unusual in its speed.
Bolivia will have a tremendous opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to build on 139 years of ties for mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla criticized Morales - one of Latin America's most conservative presidents - for using the issue of the sea as a political issue for him.
Bolivia will not give up its right to the Pacific Ocean, he said.
The decision is an opportunity to show that the past must be left behind.
North Korea says it will not release its nuclear bombs unless it is loyal to the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would not deliver its nuclear bombs if it was not loyal to Washington.
Li was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill its promises made at a high-level meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
His remarks come before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo resumed interim nuclear talks three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Li says it is a mere hope that the North will fall on the sidelines and the U.S. rejects the declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang begins to deliver its nuclear bombs.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second-level meeting.
But the general opinion is that Pyonggayng was not justified in releasing its nuclear bomb stockpiles as that nation was the only one to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month for a second Kim-Trump-level summit.
Fashion designers show the latest trends for hats going to a Grand Prix near you
If you want to recharge your hats or just block the sun, no more than these.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled different large hats for their SS19 collection for the ski slope which impressed at an event at Paris Fashion Design Week.
The most luxurious hats are in high demand this summer, and these designers have put their amazing creations on the catwalk.
Valention was particularly impressed by the distinctive black kiwi hat which was decorated with a broad, woolly mane surrounding the edges of the ribbon.
Other major captives included the classical merengue, a hat hat and a spinning top - but these were not designed to warm your hat.
Thom Browne also introduced a different selection of masks - which came before Halloween.
Many of the colorful faces led to lipstick, and Hannibal Lectre was very much like that of a prince.
One is made from seaweed with a hook and ring, and the other is shaped like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're into the high fashion design scene - you're in luck.
Fashion design observers predict that the trend may be to move to the main streets near you.
The giant hats are followed by the La Bomba, the corn hat and a two-foot wide hat that have been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The popularity behind the casual hat that was widely circulated on social media gave another major innovation to the hat - a wheat-grass hat, similar to a hat that shows its size to the wearer.
The clockwise eastern sash, with a sash and a white clay key, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "My expectation is to see big hats and hats on the main street for next summer - as the fashion designer has a huge influence it's hard to ignore the demand for very large hats".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for international scholars
Scottish independent schools continue to maintain high academic standards and, as in 2018 with significant test results, are also confirmed by individual and community successes in sport, the arts, music, and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools are accredited by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which is committed to providing a high standard of care for their students and parents.
Private schools seek to empower their students to pursue further and higher education, to pursue their career path and their place as global leaders.
As an academic field where a specific school curriculum can be created and implemented, we believe that modern languages continue to be an important and needed subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will be in his mind".
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to tie the knot with the native.
From this year's assessment results, we are seeing languages ranking highly in the sectional rankings and in the pass rates in private schools.
68 percent of students who pursued foreign languages received an A grade above.
Data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students received an A+ grade for Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people of their time will need.
Modern languages, such as subject choice, have equal power with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in specific school curricula and other areas.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey found that when employers' sources of job vacancies were asked to fill, 17 per cent said language proficiency was the cause.
It is therefore increasingly important to pursue language skills to equip young people for their future careers.
With the increasing number of job opportunities that require languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important worldwide.
Regardless of the career path a person chooses, if he learned a second language, he is ahead of his time in pursuing a stable skill like this.
Being able to communicate with foreigners has put a foreign-speaking person ahead of other job applicants.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were not proficient in a foreign language, and French was the only language known to reach the double digit percentage, at 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to focus on language teaching now for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, allows children to find more practical jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
Many schools will focus on more modern languages, and some will teach languages that they say will be more important for the UK as we look to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter how talented your child is, there are still plenty of languages to choose from in special schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment where children are empowered and have the skills they need to succeed, regardless of the circumstances of their early life.
There is no denying that in today's global business environment, languages will continue to be important to the future of language, and this must be reflected in education.
Today, the proper setting for modern languages is international communication skills.
Independent schools continue to offer this choice, prestige and importance to Scottish youth.
It always does.
John Edward is the Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will play his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans who want to see LeBron play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first test game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not known how many minutes he played.
It's more than one and less than 48, Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell was interviewed just minutes before James played.
After the injury this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game test schedule.
"I don't need to have a test match at this stage of my career to be able to play", he says.
Trump's West Virginia rally, July YouTube
President Trump's presidential inauguration ceremonies will begin this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This was the first of five Trump rallies scheduled in a week, including at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The election is still pending for his nomination to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, and Trump is seeking to rally support for his declining second term reelection as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November elections are called.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online via streaming on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak at this week's sentencing of Senate Majority Leader Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing charges of terrorism, and postpone the Senate confirmation vote for another week while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this multi-party establishment is to help Republicans gain support before the November elections.
Thus, President Trump's command team said that these five meetings this week are "a provocation to supporters and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress is very important to his agenda, and the President will travel to as many parts of the country as we can as we enter the territorial command phase", a spokesman for Trump's command team told Reuters, declining to be identified.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's event is likely to draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be followed by Pittsburgh media, the West Virginia Metro News reports.
On Saturday, Trump visited West Virginia for the second time this month, the state that won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey as the president is coming to re-elect him", said Simon Haeder, a political analyst at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA will fight hard to stay alive for the singles on Sunday
After three rounds of play on one side, Saturday afternoon's four was probably the right one for this Ryder Cup.
The phenomenon of tidal variation is believed to have originated in sports and was later adapted for competitions such as these.
So where is the tide going now?
"They were six strokes ahead going, and they're four now, so we're probably behind the tide", Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe are ahead, but they have four goals ahead and 12 to play.
Spieth said the Americans were making progress and that they were finally seeing results in themselves, especially as Spieth and Justin Thomas played together for the entire day and scored three goals from four.
Spieth was averse to tea and green and was the most generous.
Then the balls got too strong as he went, and he needed a crucial shot to tie the game in the fourth, when he and Thomas were behind by two.
His shot that won the game by 15 was just as powerful as the shot that made you realize the American team was still in this tournament.
"You have to be really broken and just think about your own play", Spieth says.
This is all that is left of these plays today.
18 drums to stand upright.
The only players to score more goals than Spieth and Thomas in both days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup legend.
The two different but well-liked European champions have won four out of four and are unlikely to go wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple not to receive a Saturday night slot, but they also avoided a Saturday morning slot, Friday night slot and late Friday night slot.
That play, and the way their best runs came from this manicured marble, showed that they were the players for Sunday's push, and that no player was more important to win the potential match for Europe at sunset against Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Ideally they are both at different frequencies.
But the story of the European hero is very early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were not particularly badly off against Sergio Garcia, the morning's champion, who was alongside Alex Noren.
A yes and two no vote in the first nine put the Spanish and Dutch into a dilemma they never had.
But on Sunday, no one is there to help you with your problem.
It is particularly interesting to observe the balls and the four to be kept close together due to the interactions between the pair, the directions they are given and not given and the apparent proximity of a strategy.
Europe played better than this and they were still ahead going into the final day but it was clear in this quarter that the USA were strong and that some, especially in America, were wrong.
Europe is 10-6 ahead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe still leads on the final day of the Ryder Cup after four games on Saturday, and they are 10-6 against the United States.
The inspirational duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins over Tiger Woods to make their tally to four this season at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy won two years earlier at Hazeltine, was up against the American team that had to settle for a 3-1 win in the morning game.
The U.S. was stronger in the four and had won two games, but still wasn't close.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the title.
Fleetwood became the first European pair to win four consecutive titles, and together with Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a spectacular weekend, the second pair to win four from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Woods and Patrick Reed both shot in the balls, and they teamed up to defeat Woods and American boxer Bryson Dechambeau by 5&4.
Woods struggled in both games on Saturday and showed some impressive performances but has now lost 19 of 29 games with four walks and seven strikeouts.
Justin Rose, who had been pitching for the morning balls, returned to Henrik Stenson in the fours to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2&1 - both ranked number one and number three in the world.
But it did not fly well all the way to Europe on a sunny, windy day at the port of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time winner, and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two goals on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2&1 game against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarters, and he came back to push Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fourth after losing the first two quarters.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from four points behind in individual games, although Furyk's team had to tie for the trophy.
However, after a second stay of two days, it seems that it may be too difficult for them to return again on Sunday.
North Korea says it will never release its nuclear bombs if they are true
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the United States was deeply distrusted by the sanctions and that the country would not release its nuclear bombs under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had made "many good intentions" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests and pledging not to stockpile nuclear bombs and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing the same response from the U.S"., he said.
If the U.S. is not credible, our national defense will not be supported, and under those circumstances we will never deliver our nuclear bombs first.
Although Li echoed similar complaints by North Korea about Washington's resistance to a proposed path to nuclear disarmament that would pay North Korea if it followed that path, his remarks seem significant in that they did not challenge their nuclear arms embargo as Pyongyang had previously claimed.
Li spoke of a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during a first-level meeting between a U.S. President and a North Korean official in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim vowed to pursue a path to "dismantling the nuclear bombs of the Korean peninsula" and Trump vowed to ensure North Korea's defense.
North Korea seeks an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that they must surrender their nuclear bombs first.
Washington also rejected proposals to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. remains committed to the elimination of nuclear weapons first and to increasing the intensity of the pressure to achieve their goals through a military solution, and opposes the declaration of an end to the war, Li said.
The idea that we make the wrong mistakes is foolish to us.
But the problem is that our compatibility is further complicated by the stable binaries.
Li did not comment on arrangements for a second-level summit between Kim and Trump discussed by the U.S. official at the United Nations this week.
The minister had already spoken of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: If the party in this case is the denuclearization of South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of Korea will never end like this.
However, Li's speech was in a very different spirit than last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that South Korean missiles would not be sent directly to the U.S. after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "suicide missile".
This year at the United Nations, Trump made a lot of remarks, threatening to "completely eliminate" North Korea last year, thanking Kim for his determination to pursue the path to denuclearization, but saying there was still much work to be done and that the barriers must remain so that North Korea's nuclear weapons are not destroyed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, "If it's two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have demanded that the U.N. Security Council compensate Pyongyang for their actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Nuclear Security Council on Tuesday: "The Security Council's nuclear weapons sanctions must continue and not be delayed until we see the complete, final and definitive elimination of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council generally agreed to increase sanctions against North Korea from 2006 to cut funding for Pyongyang's bombing and nuclear weapons programs.
Pompeo met with Li on the eve of the U.N. General Assembly meetings and later said he would travel to Pyongyang later that month to prepare for the second-level meeting.
Pompeo made three trips to North Korea this year, but his last trip was not successful.
Upon leaving Pyongyang in July he claimed to be making progress, but a few hours later he was criticized by North Korea for his "terrorist" claims.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would drop a bomb site and a nuclear facility and that the United States would follow these same steps.
He said Kim told him that he was looking for "similar arrangements" and security guarantees since Trump's oath in Singapore and moved to strengthen relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on the amount of earned income
In a recent study at Harvard University this year, all undergraduate students turned to getting more sleep as a counter to the growing culture of academic slump by drinking coffee to work late at night.
An academic at the world's leading university found that students simply did not know the most basic things about protecting themselves.
The study was created by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and he believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He came up with the idea to start the study after giving a talk about the impact of minimal sleep on learning.
Finally a girl came to me and said: "Why did I even know about this when I was in my last year?"
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - I was shocked by this", he told The Telegraph.
This study, conducted for the first time this year, provided students with an introduction to the benefits of good sleep habits in academic and sporting activities and improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the study after finding that students get very little sleep per week.
The one-hour lessons include interactive exercises.
In one episode there is a depiction of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, bars, sports gloves and books and read about the effects of coffee and sunlight, and how sports performance is affected by minimal sleep and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants discuss how poor sleep affects respiratory problems, brain tumors, depression and cancer.
The campus's layout, with interactive nights, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they should be able to know - just as we should be able to know about the health effects of pipe eating", says Professor Czeisler.
He argued that the culture of boasting about working late at night was persistent, and that the problem of students' lack of sleep was exacerbated by new technologies and increased stress.
Ensuring that the student gets enough and quality sleep is the key to relieving stress, stress and boredom - and preventing walking fatigue, when too little sleep enters the brain and the person stays awake.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course and took one of the courses that year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said it opened his eyes and inspired him to take this course widely across the university.
He believes the next step is to ask all foreign students to take the same course before entering the university.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for falling back asleep and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of ultraviolet light from electric screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your body clock, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers were also knocked out in the first round after losing 1-0 to Steven Gerrard's side by a Dolly Menga goal at Livingston.
Ibrox's side had been looking for their first win away from a 4-1 defeat at St Johnstone in the Championship, but a loss to Gary Holt's side doubled those defeats in 18 games as manager to put his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership champions Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the second half and the Rangers were no closer to scoring.
Although Rangers fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and was just behind Hibernian by a point difference.
There may be further problems for Rangers after goalkeeper Calum Spence suffered a knee injury when a tool was thrown at him from the visitors' side.
Gerrard had seven goals against the team that pushed Ayr out in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
But Holt remained in his starting lineup as they took a goal from Hearts last week, ending up probably happy with his performance as his team's top scorer scored against their opponent.
Although Rangers had the ball mostly, Livingstone's use of the ball was more efficient when they were in charge.
They normally scored two minutes into Menga's first impact to put Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal post but were instead hampered with the ball to the side.
A long-range penalty kick by Keaghan Jacobs was better than captain Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithgow's kick was also hampered in the back leg.
Rangers came back strong but they were just disappointed that the truth about how they played in the third round was not being told.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced he should have scored two and a half minutes in their match against Steven Lawless but defender Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's punches.
There were only two direct kicks in the first half but Liam Kelly's defense was not difficult to defend against Lassana Coulibaly's kickoff and Ovie Ejaria's free kick.
Although Livi scored a surprise goal in the 34th minute, it cannot be said that they were not entitled to score because of their broken neck.
Rangers also had difficulty keeping up with Jacobs' regular-season games.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson and took a long time to hit Menga to finish.
Gerrard turned to pass Coulibaly for Ryan Kent in the second period and almost immediately made an impact as the ball passed Morelos but Kelly's axe quickly reached and ran from his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to urge the visitors to play whatever game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting each long ball kick.
Holt's team almost scored again in the final stages but McGregor was strong enough to stop Jacobs before Lithgow's shot from the corner came off.
Rangers defender Glenn Middleton claimed a penalty in the penalty area in their clash with Jacobs but Thomson was still unconvinced.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
So, a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and it's NOT TODAY... the day physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for finding and measuring radiation, and made an object from this known as the Geiger Counter.
A science-fiction classic since then, the Geiger Counter has also been a pop culture classic, notably in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring veteran science fiction actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that?
Rogers: A Geiger Counter, used to find radioactive materials, such as magnesium.
When you absorb these carbon atoms, you hear the effects of the molecules that are released from the fusion through the membranes.
Evans: "It's really exploding!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the one who bears his name lives forever.
The new cancer vaccine can allow our immune system to learn to kill malignant cells.
A cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill off malignant cells and kill them off.
Immunization teaches the immune system to recognize which cells are in the treatment.
This involves taking immune cells from a patient, which are harvested in a laboratory.
Then proteins common to many cancers are found and injected further.
An experimental vaccine is producing results in patients with cancer types.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which studies the immune system to recognize which cells, saw her lung cancer go untreated for more than 18 months.
This method involves taking immune cells from a patient, breaking them up in the laboratory to make a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-infecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest a highly effective and sustained vaccine".
HER2 is thought to be involved in the development of many types of cancer, including cancer of the esophagus, stomach, bladder and spleen, explains Professor Berzofsky.
Another similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and studying how to target cancer cells in the treatment of a rare disease also emerged.
Kanye West spoke about Trump's goodwill, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
Not Good
Kanye West made a cameo appearance in the studio on a Saturday Night Live show after a rocky decision in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After her third song of the night, Ghost Town and wearing a Make America Great hat, she became a spokeswoman for the Democrats and renewed her support for Trump.
How many times have I talked to the media and they said: "Why are you so obsessed with Trump, he's a racist?"
So if I was worried about racism I would have just left America", he said.
SNL began the show with a dramatization of Matt Damon challenging Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the rape allegations of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not publicly announced, a video of West's speech was posted on social media by Chris Rock's fanbase.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to seduce West with his knife.
For some reason, West complained to viewers that he was being shot in the back for his hat.
They threatened me from behind.
They said, "Don't go forward with that hat".
They made fun of me!
They call me a potato", he said, according to The Washington Examiner.
West also said: "Do you want to see me eat potatoes?" and "I'm going to bury my human skull, which you can't tell me to do". Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.
He was both ridiculed for his comments by viewers and embarrassed by SNL members, Variety reports, with one person telling the magazine: "The lab was really crazy".
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, singer-songwriter Mac Miller, had recently died.
Many were skeptical of West's singing in his song I Love It, wearing a Perrier skirt.
West was supported by the TPUSA grassroots group, Candace Turner, who delivered her dissertation: "To one of the most brilliant minds: WHAT IT WAS TO BE IN THE MARKET".
But witness Karen Hunter has released a statement saying that West is still the same, and that it is for the best.
But I will NOT offer compensation (by selling his music or clothes or sponsoring his artwork) to someone I believe is harassing or preaching bad morals to my community.
It means.
We are too", he said.
Prior to the show, a teaser on YouTube revealed that he had changed his name, stating that his former name was Kanye West.
He was not the first artist to change his music, and was succeeded by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Snoop Doogie-Dickie was once known as Snoop Lion, and with the late rapper Prince, changed his name to a nickname.
An allegation of attempted rape for injection at a pub in Belfast
An attempt to rape the title character was made on a 45-year-old man following an injection at a pub in east Belfast on Friday.
This happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The impeachment is due to take place before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
Titles are reviewed by the Public Service Commission.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denies wrongful convictions
Kit Harington is best known for his portrayal of Jon Snow the swordsman on the HBO fantasy drama series Game of Thrones.
But it appears that the 31-year-old is challenging the gender hero's mistakes, saying that young men are making mistakes and should be empowered to take them seriously.
She spoke to The Sunday Times Culture, believing Kit was wrong and asking how to address the problem of negative stereotyping in the #MeToo era.
Game of Thrones star Kit married his longtime girlfriend Rose Leslie, also 31, and said he had strong ideas about how to fix the problem.
"My thoughts are very strong right now - where are we wrong about the conflict?", he said.
What lessons can we learn from men as they grow up, about the problems we see today?
Kit from TV believes part of the blame for the rise in negative stereotyping is due to the extremely stereotypical characters.
He also said: "What is learned and what is learned?"
Why is it on TV, on the streets, that boys are mistaken for having a different side of the man?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time - how do we change that?
It seems to be wrong for young men.
In an interview he said he was not interested in doing any previous or subsequent Game of Thrones films when the shows ended at the end of the following summer, saying he had "not lost interest in the wild horses and horses".
From November Kit starred in Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a filmmaker and his brother, a lawyer.
He recently said that meeting his girlfriend was the most important thing that happened on Game of Thrones.
What happened to my girlfriend in this show, so my future family, and mine from today, got her key.
Ygritte's Rose, the love interest of Jon Snow's character Kit, in the Emmy-winning show's series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its children infected with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 are infected in the country, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by ticks, which is a variation from the previous one.
From the earliest times, HIV infection in parts of China was rapidly spreading due to contaminated blood vessels.
But the number of people infected with HIV through this method has decreased and is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
However, each year, the number of new HIV and Aids cases in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by being in the LGBT community in China is a serious problem.
Criminal penalties for homosexuality were abolished in China in 1997, but LGBT people remain severely restricted.
Due to traditional national values, studies show that about 70-90% of men say that a man will marry a woman.
Many transfers of resources have resulted from the unintended consequences of these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatments widely available in a bid to curb the epidemic.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP lawmaker data, and she denies the "debilitating lies and theories of the class".
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her staffers had leaked the personal information of three U.S. Republican lawmakers to Wikipedia pages for lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by far-right individuals and websites.
"No, lies, and even more heinous lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided includes the home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
This information appeared online on Thursday, allegedly by an unidentified man on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The release came after Kavanaugh was questioned by three lawmakers.
Crime scams such as Gateway Pundit and RedState claimed that the KI address identified the source of the alleged abuse related to Watters' department and provided information of a Waters employee, the Hill report.
"This common-pool hypothesis is completely false, "" Waters said.
No employee of mine - whose identity, personal information, and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - provided this information.
This normal pit curve is completely false, and ends in a curve.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
There is anger in this rejection, wrote Fleischer.
This indicates that he does not have the proper type of status as a Web Member.
If a man is accused of a day's work he has done, he should never be angry.
Never let him get away with it.
He shall not be a hindrance to the cause of the accuser.
You must be, yes.
Fleischer appeared to compare Walters's response to Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who some critics accused of being too strongly angry at the judges' judgments.
Omar Navarro also expressed his views on the election, as a Republican candidate trying to push Waters out of the midterm elections.
It is enough if it is right, if it is right.
In his statement, Waters said his office had been briefed by regulators and law enforcement authorities on these allegations of fraud.
We will ensure that the guilty are found and that they are punished by law for their evil deeds and weakening all my servants.
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's groundbreaking technical thriller
The search for Brexit references in recent British films and documentaries has now become commonplace, culminating in this revival of the licensed Johnny English action comedy - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is self-activism a threat to our inability to sell opportunities in the island's new waters?
However, the licensing of Blind Eye has been renewed, with Johnny English having to drop out for a second season - his name implies a general moniker designed for non-European-speaking movie-watching countries.
He is also the secret water polo player despite trying to convince him that he looks like Clouseau, and that Mr Bean and the man who was the one-night stand of Chariots of Fire at the opening of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He also descended from the traveller and secret international Atkinson had previously settled on in Barclaycard's marketing lectures, all of which left him in disarray.
There are some dubious important moments in the modern JE demonstration.
I was fascinated by Johnny English walking up to the carriage and wearing his old clothes and the temporary dismissal of the carriage by his hard hat.
Atkinson's abilities to play the action are seen, but the comedy is somewhat dull and dull, when the action genre of films such as 007 and Mission Impossible has been strongly influenced by the action.
The plot seems to be aimed at children rather than children, and for me, being uninventive, the very different English styles such as Atkinson's silent films in the Bean series are effective.
The current issue is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A spy-agent has just entered Britain's most secret intelligence database, revealing who all the British intelligence officers are and surprisingly all the officers are on duty - a small part for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final problem for a critical, seditious prime minister who is being heavily criticized by the political world: Emma Thompson is too strong to compare herself to a character like Teresa-May but has too little chemistry in the script to follow her.
His advisers told him that he was in danger of being exonerated and that someone had to be brought back from the exoneration.
That is, bringing back Johnny English, who is now a principal at a prestigious school, but is learning some extracurricular subjects on how to work as a stand-up comedian: here there are some comedy clubs, while English offers a kind of comedy college similar to the School of Rock.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency explanation and reunited with his former bandmate Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough, now a diving champion, is married to a female diver who is played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So the two Batman and Robin-like characters return to make their big mistakes working for the Queen's Secret Service and meet the beautiful character of Olga Kurylenko and Ophelia Bulletova.
Thus, the idea of the prime minister is gaining traction from the tech world's top intellectuals who claim it can solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, the villain Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures: they pretend to be waiters and burn down a French restaurant; they have a secret affair while riding a bicycle in the wealthy Volta estate; they all spy on English and use a Virtual World simulator to simulate him to conditions in Volta's house.
It is particularly hard-hitting for the latter segment, but despite its simplicity and speed, it is well suited to children's television situations.
It's pretty simple.
And as with other Johnny English films I wonder: why can't the British film industry offer a film role to Rowan Atkinson that fully exploits his talents?
Labour argues that it is making plans for Britons to switch to a four-day workweek but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is opting for a radically different plan where British people work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company owners to offer savings resulting from artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them a day off.
Workers get a three-day weekend - but the same pay.
In the media the idea is based on the economic policy of the group and ensuring that the nation supports the workers.
The move to a four-day workweek has been supported by the Trades Union Congress which would benefit workers from a transformed economy.
A leading Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year".
Implementation is slow but a four-day workweek is desirable in line with the group's approach to balancing a labor-intensive economy with the group's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party was not the first party to support such an idea, and the Green Party promised a four-day workweek in its 2017 general election mandate.
However, this does not receive widespread support from the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a policy at the union and is not currently being voted on by the party".
Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to open up his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was reluctant to take power away from faceless CEOs and to disrupt utility companies.
In the prime minister's plans the water company shareholders may not be able to recover all their debt as the Labour government may impose levies on the decision to do so.
He also advocated for the inclusion of workers on company boards and the creation of Income Tax Relief Funds to provide 10 per cent of public-sector corporate income to workers, who could earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether an FBI investigation can make their views known
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings can force Republican lawmakers to pull out of their support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI would find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I should say yes", Kennedy said.
I said before the trial, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this accusation came out and said, 'Are you guilty?'
He was sharp, tough, and straightforward.
Graham's election, however, seems to have been a rocky one.
"I had my doubts about Brett Kavanaugh and ended up with a very serious accusation to turn", he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know why, but I do know this: Brett was very critical", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And why not all the people he mentioned could confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any difference.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Did It Have a Result in Reducing Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring the most popular artists and a very exciting industry; ending the global nonprofit.
This is the seventh year, and crowds and crowds gather at the Global Citizen Festival on the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to celebrate the event's goal of ending super wealth before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was announced in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizen Festival, an advocacy group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who struggle with it.
To get a free ticket to the concert (but only if you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete certain tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or taking other appropriate measures to help meet the goal of ending bankruptcy.
But how did the Global Citizen Festival survive the 12 years it had to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a real free concert to encourage people to rise up, or is it the same aspect of opposition - that people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have captured 19 million tweets from its subscribers, commanding a number of different targets.
It is claimed that these efforts have helped world leaders to inform their travel and policy plans that are worth more than $37 billion and will impact the worlds of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, 390 groups claimed in filings and statements from his activities, at least $10 billion in assets had already been distributed or accumulated.
The group claims that the financial crisis has positively affected an estimated 649 million people worldwide.
Some notable donations include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based fundraising and advocacy organization dedicated to helping children grow to reach their full potential, which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 submissions from Global Voices.
"With the support of the U.K. government, national governments, and Global Scientists like yourself, the social devastation of malnutrition could be preserved in the history books", said The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracey Ullman at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 campaigns in the U.K. calling for better nutrition for mothers and children, the government has released funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking Why do you think we can get rid of the non-profit?
The world's smartest person replied: "It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall short, we fall short".
But, as with all great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in the past, we will succeed, as we become stronger in unity.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers taking part in this year's event at The Big Apple, and Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are the hosts.
US may use Gulf War as a pretext to disrupt Russian oil sales - National Secretary
Washington could use its Naval Warfare if necessary to prevent Russian forces from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, according to The Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that the very purpose of Russia's intervention in Syria - which was largely at the request of the government there itself - was to bolster new energy markets.
"I believe that their own purpose in the Middle East is to organize the energies as they do in Eastern Europe, south of the European heart", he said.
Finally, according to the official, there are also certain factors that can ensure this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary to make contact to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed an audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that claims to be the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He compared Washington's comparison of Russia to Iran, saying they were essentially the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia, he said, would be to use force and replace the tyrants, and he said that Russia has only one strength: that the economy relies on tyrants.
The statements come as the Trump administration seeks to increase carbon capping in Europe, replacing Russia, the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, tried to pressure Germany to get out of the "misguided" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said was being built in Berlin through Moscow.
Moscow has long argued that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is an $11 billion project, doubling the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, an alternative economic project.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's strong opposition to the project is a purely economic one and is a model of aggression.
"I believe we share the view that energy is not a commodity, and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany strongly supported the US position, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called for the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow to be excluded.
"The biggest problem for me is interference by a foreign government with our energy reserves", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider running for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he considered standing down.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and we'll stop having a woman as our leader", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for President.
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during the meeting in the suburbs, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about Donald Trump's actions against our democracy", he said.
Warren challenged Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said that we should have an FBI investigation before the election.
However, according to an election poll published on Tuesday, the majority of people in Warren's constituency do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who voted "mean" said the legislature should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two supported him to stand.
Polls showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting him to run and 48 percent opposed to him.
Other well-known Democratic names discussed for possible 2020 nominations include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide his speech as a Republican, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin spoke about Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being deployed in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"The pressures that have been pressing my son since he came back, I know some families understand the effects of PTSD and injuries to soldiers when they come back", he told a gathering of supporters of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's account of her capture was "a whore in a room" and also told of her son and other whores, who were different when they returned, hardened and more concerned about whether they were being respected for their military and air force comrades, and other troops of the United States, who had sacrificed so much for the country.
He was arrested by law enforcement on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault on a woman, obtaining a report of domestic assault and carrying a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police.
18 state and D.C. departments are supporting a challenge to the new immigration policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum to refugees fleeing forced or domestic displacement.
Representatives from 18 state and local chapters filed a court-appointed summary on Friday in Washington in support of a challenge to the asylum policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the accuser in the Grave case against Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in the Hereditary Bar that criticizes government policy, has not yet been revealed.
She claimed that she had been abused by her boyfriend and his abusive sons of gangs, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
The land division lawyer who supported Grace argued for The Savior, Honotura and Guam, which have a high number of asylum seekers in the U.S., countries that are plagued by serious problems related to refugees and domestic violence.
The new U.S. immigration policy overturned a Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed unauthorized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that his new policy "is a reversal of the law of many years of the land, state and international sectors".
The law of the state in which the asylum claim is made constrains each claimant on the merits and circumstances of the claim and violates that principle, the court's summary partner said.
Lawyers argued in brief that the policy of banning immigrants was a weapon against the U.S. economy, arguing that most would enter as immigrants and that they were the required workers.
The Supreme Court ordered Jeff Sessions to stop immigration judges from granting asylum to prisoners fleeing domestic violence and kidnapping in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June,
It is not a universal solution to all the problems -- even all the big problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Balu continue to find threats to the surge in casualties
For the monkeys, it has been particularly hard on the larval stage.
"The spirit of the hospital is strong", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is raising her baby son in an orphanage in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance has brought in emergency personnel.
Pure water is very rare.
Residents were seen returning to their homes, unpacking their waterlogged properties, and trying to figure out what was possible.
How many people were injured in the magnitude 7.5 quake, and how many hospitals were evacuated?
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who broke his back and ribs, are outside the Palu General Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to the direct impact of the waves.
His eyes flooded as he spoke of his experience in the largest room at the time in a room on the fifth floor of the hotel next to his girlfriend and their daughter.
They had no time to heal themselves.
I knew I was being bullied by the explosions, Harris told The Associated Press, adding that they were coming to a wedding.
I heard my girlfriend screaming for help, but her voice was muffled.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are well.
U.S. government official alleges China is being "pushed" by "false flags"
A week after an authoritative Chinese newspaper published a four-page article in a U.S. newspaper discussing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread its ideas.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently commented on Wednesday on the China Daily's reading in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after it accused China of interfering in the U.S. presidential election in November, and China denies this accusation.
Trump's accusation of Beijing interfering in U.S. elections, according to U.S. officials who told Reuters, marks a new phase in a Washington mandate to try to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertising to facilitate trade, the trade dispute between Beijing and Washington is increasingly intense, and both jointly impose tariffs on each other's exports.
The purpose of China's massive tariffs at the start of the trade dispute was to kill off protesters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, say China and U.S. analysts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, said that a supply zone for agricultural goods to China, Beijing, was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "They are now making their threat even stronger by publishing the error readings in our free newspapers".
While releasing their false statements, the Chinese government is following the traditional American tradition of free press and free press by including a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad writes.
"As a newspaper shop on a street here in Beijing, where there is little criticism, you end up not seeing the different views of the Chinese people about China's economic decline when the media is under the guidance of the Chinese Community Party", he writes.
He also said that one of China's leading newspapers had refused his request to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republican Party to ban female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh issue, analysts warn
While senior Republican members are strongly supporting the Visitors' Court ruling on allegations of corruption, analysts are warning of a potential backlash, especially from the left, during the upcoming midterm elections.
This has caused much concern, with most Republican members saying the election should go ahead.
Those questions can be answered", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he did not believe Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) 's backdoor order for the FBI to investigate voters could be justified.
"Women do not forget yesterday's problems - they do not forget their tomorrow, and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the activist group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted November is coming! as they protested the Senate's decision to move forward with the impeachment of Kavanaugh despite the recommendation of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The Democratic people have a strong sense of motivation and motivation", Rothernberg, a liberal political analyst at the news site, said.
People say that spirit is powerful; and rightly so.
However, it is more likely to be stronger, especially among immigrant women voters in the states and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, even if they are not close to the President but do not vote in general.
And before Ford's public defense speech explaining his allegations of bias against the Central Committee chairman, analysts believe it could have a serious impact if the Republicans continue to push ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a major problem for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will get on the ballot, it's about how the Republican Party will handle this and prepare for it", Guy Cecil, founder of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the American public is becoming more divided in who to believe after the positive comments of Ford and Kavanaugh, and is becoming more and more sympathetic to Kavanaugh.
A poll from YouGov showed 41 percent of respondents strongly believed and likely believed Ford, while nearly 35 percent said they strongly believed and likely believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said Kavanaugh may or may not have been naked in his advocacy statements, and nearly 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's order, the FBI is currently investigating allegations raised by Ford and at least one other suspect, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford made his testimony before the Judiciary Committee under oath last week on the charge that Kavanaugh had molested him while he was drunk, aged 17 at the time.
Ramirez allegedly showed the Supreme Court justice cheating on him at a party while he and she were at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Google Books
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new venture to compete with Google, Amazon and Google.
The tech giant's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that expands on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users are allowed to choose where their data is stored and what information people have access to.
In a recent interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee famously said that Inrupt's vision was to be the leader in the world.
"That must be done now", he said of the new company.
This is an important historical period.
The app uses Solid technologies to allow people to create their own personal online database, or POD.
Contacts lists, to-do lists, calendars, music sources and other personal and professional tools can be kept.
Some such as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in the same browser at any time.
The uniqueness of personal online data is that the user has the means to determine what types of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "data-driven self-authentication".
The advantage for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company will have the resources, process and efficiency skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several developer staff hired to work on the project, and a community of codebreaking volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own distributed apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team had not discussed with Google and Google whether or not they would introduce significant differences that would turn their entire business model around overnight.
We did not ask for their permission.
In an op-ed in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt release is a free and open source release with an ecosystem to help protect the reliability and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over whether the web should remain free and open.
Until the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the Founder and Executive Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very excited about the next phase of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria's most celebrated World War 1 naval minister
The only minister of the Missionary Church to receive the Victoria Cross has been knighted in his home town over a hundred years ago.
Lt Col Minister Bernard Vann was appointed to the position on 29 September 1918 at the headquarters at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was assassinated by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a memorial in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a remarkable feat that the stone was unearthed exactly one hundred years after his grandfather's remarkable feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his convoy across the Canal de Saint-Quenti  in fog and was shelling from rifles and rotary cannons.
He was driven by the flames of the fire and with a steely temper he led the barricade before he blew himself up with a rifle and killed a third.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on November 4, 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said of his grandfather's actions: "It's a situation that I can't get over but it's a humiliation".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also organized a post-graduate residency, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a great honor to be involved in the founding and he also said that the confidence of a true champion is guaranteed by the support of many people.
MMA fans continued to wake up at night to watch Bellator 206, but they already got Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you were awake and watching Bellator 206 crowded with people but you didn't get to watch the main episode.
The San Jose-based franchise includes 13 fights, including six on the main card, and is shown nightly in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare for a duel, viewers in the UK roared in the show's change to Peppa Pig.
Some were not ashamed as they would have been if they had stayed up for several hours a night to watch the fight.
A fan on Facebook commented that the restriction on children's comics was "the worst kind of work".
State rules at 6 a.m. made such a show inappropriate and so it was moved to children's shows, said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the show.
""Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would be planning for their shows to be available to UK viewers later.
"I think we can fix the re-shows", Coker said.
However, it is six o'clock on a Sunday, and we cannot choose this as a Sunday in our time, and it is Monday in their time.
But we are doing it.
Believe it or not, in the long run, there are many obstacles to going back and forth and ending up unsuccessful.
When we tried to fix it, we mistook it for another technical error.
But no, it was a government issue.
I promise this will never happen again.
We were only going to have five fights instead of six - like the organization is now - we were trying to get more fans to play, and we moved beyond that.
This is a linear function.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's self-reflection was undermined by his own discovery
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said he had low self-esteem as he grew older because of his skin color - but that's where his nose came from.
He said that, at 24, after his second term he realized that not everyone was like him.
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Laruen Laverne, she spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
As a parent he was not particularly focused on winning the Olympic Games.
The long-running show's host, Kirsty Young, has been on hiatus for several months due to her illness.
On Laverne's first appearance, Daley said that she was "a little less than everyone else growing up" because she didn't have a sexual orientation.
He said: "To this day, those little thoughts, those different thoughts about me, are the things that have really helped me to get my nose out.
Wanting to show off his power, he did not want everyone to be blind to his identity.
The Olympic bronze medalist is a well-known LGBT activist and used her competition at the World Amateur Championships in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He expressed his views as he was fortunate to be free and as he wanted others to have the same expectations.
The three-time world champion said of her relationship with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "I was shocked".
Daley married Oscar winner, who was 20 years her senior, that year but said that their age difference was not a problem.
"When the big pressures come when you're growing up" - she went to her first Olympics when she was 14 and her father died three years later - she said it was hard for her to find another person of the same age as she had the ups and downs.
In June the couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daley, their son, and Daley said that he had "a very different idea".
"If you asked me last year, the big theme was ""I should have won a gold medal""," she said.
"You know, there are more important things than winning an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist".
He has a son named Robbie, who died in 2011, aged 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of his last questions to me was if I had received his tickets for London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front seat.
"I didn't have the courage to say 'there's no time to be in the front row,'" she said.
"I held his breath for his last breath, and he stopped at the end of his training, and I knew he was not a leper", she said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all along - to swim in front of my own people at an Olympic Trials, there was no other soul than this", she said.
Her first song selection also appeared in this - Proud by Heather Small which touched her emotional energy as she trained for the Olympics and the urine kept running through her.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson has been ruled out for Saturday's Ryder Cup due to his injury
Phil Mickelson of the United States set a record on Sunday when he played in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he had to play much higher to avoid missing his grand slam.
He played in the tournament every two years for a record 12 seasons, and was favored by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and a four-ball game on Saturday.
However, he did not play and was one of the top players in the United States, winning five major championships, splitting his day supporting the team and improving his game on the field in the hope that he would correct his mistakes.
He was not a very straightforward rider, nor was he, when he won, a man who, at 48 years old, was particularly well suited to the Le Golf National, which was plagued by poor riders in long runs.
And why, aside from the football field, Mickelson, playing in Game 9 on Sunday against British Championship champion Francesco Molinari, is tied with Tommy Fleetwood and they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans start well, they are four points behind when they start 12 games, Mickelson could be a factor.
Furyk is loyal to his man, but he can't possibly say more than that.
"He was so clear about what he was doing today, he tapped me on the back and hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He is very self-conscious.
He is a very active player, and he ended up being a big supporter of these teams before and this week.
I probably never thought he had only two games.
I was wrong to expect it to be more than that, but it was, and that's the situation we chose.
He wants to play, just like everyone else".
Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on a Sunday.
That may have marked the end of his Ryder Cup playing career which may not have been close to the ratings of his own individual levels.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said the team had many advantages over Mickelson.
"He was a quiet guy, he was aggressive, he was quick, he liked to take advantage of people, he ended up being a real asset to the team", he said.
"Younger players may have enjoyed getting vaccinated as well this week, and it was fun to watch.
There is more to it than just playing".
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows their big breakthrough will be slow.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, has experience where you'll have a harder time going without progress on the final day of the Ryder Cup singles.
Denmark made their debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, ahead of the team captained by Seve Ballestoros by five goals against the Americans but they still won by a very narrow margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We keep reminding ourselves of the days before we were at Valderrama; we had a lot of progress at Brookline and we were going to miss, and with Valderram, we won, but we were lucky", said Bjorn, who, it is revealed, after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to take their 10-6 nose at Le Golf National.
So I'm going to sign off, and the whole team is going to stop this game.
You'll be broke tomorrow.
Go play and do the right things.
You're not done scoring points on the floor.
If we have a goal, it is to win this prize, and ideas are held there.
I've said for a long time that I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we know exactly what's on that side of the table with all the best players in the world".
I was very happy with how these players played on a hard keyboard, Bjorn says: "I don't count my beats.
It's a very high mountain to climb tomorrow.
Tomorrow's singles match, and that's a different situation to be in.
It's great to play with a friend when you're traveling, but when you're playing alone, you're really testing yourself as a traveler.
That's the message you want to send to the players, to send your ultimate hero of tomorrow.
Now, you leave your friend, and he's gone to produce his next big thing".
In addition to Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to play better singles than doubles, but Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three goals out of four, did not.
Furyk has been on both sides of those big upsets on the final day, being in the team that won at Brookline and lost to Europe in a game known as the "Merekara at Medinah".
I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw led his players on the final day in 1999.
"There are 12 important games tomorrow, but the desire is to get a good start as quickly as Brookline, as Medinah.
When he runs to one side, it becomes difficult for those playing in the middle.
We will organize our team accordingly and bring in the right people to us, trying to make tomorrow's amazing things happen".
Thomas has taken over as the lead in the morning response and he plays Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommoy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the top half.
"Here is the list of players I named as it covers all areas", Bjorn said of his individual selections.
Germany's new border has reopened
The latest German Navy submarine was originally ordered in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era submarines, but could not be delivered until later that year due to flawed systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The order of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main transport of the newest Baden-Wuerttemberg railway, has been lifted for the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military official.
The ship was originally scheduled to enter the Pacific Ocean in 2014 but post-launch problems hampered this massive launch project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg bus lines were ordered by the Maritime Administration in 2007 and replaced the old Bremen bus lines.
Explanations include a highly powerful radioactive substance, various types of time-lapse and time-lapse explosive and some conventional technologies, such as microwave, infrared and modern optics.
Other important features are the longer interval between deployments - this means that spacecraft can sail for up to two years from domestic airports.
However, it was only after the inventions that the most recent technological innovations became obsolete - Germany was said to be able to demonstrate its capabilities abroad - and when introduced into service, Die Zeit reported.
Rumor of the troubled F125 tank became widespread that year when the German Navy decommissioned the tank and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Automotive Industry returned a car to a car manufacturer after it was released.
It is not known exactly why it was returned, but German media said it was "numerous and with software and hardware", and therefore there was no reason to doubt whether it would be sent to war.
Software errors were also significant when Baden-Wuerttemberg's transportation was operated by 120 clerks - this was half the number of people needed to operate the Bremen metro lines.
As a result, the transportation was found to be too heavy, reducing performance and increasing the capacity of the Ocean Tunnel to accommodate later improvements.
It is estimated that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighed 7,000 tons and was twice as heavy as the similar types of armoured vehicles used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, cost also plays a role in the overall purpose of the vehicle - including training the pilots.
The deal is reported to be worth €3.3bn (€3.6bn) - an increase from the initial €2.2bn.
Then the problems of the newest submarines became even more serious due to recent warnings that the German navy's capacity was decreasing.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the anti-aircraft committee of the German parliament, said that the Sea Fleet was "fewer and fewer vehicles".
The officer said whoever made the mistake then made the mistake again, as the old cars were discarded but no new cars were replaced.
His failure prevented the Baden-Wuerttemberg type of motor vehicle from being included in the Motor Vehicle.
The National Trust listens to the secret world of bats
Recent research conducted in a village in the Highlands of Scotland aims to explore how bats use land for food digestion.
It is hoped that the observations will identify the behaviours of these unique flightless mammals and help guide future charitable efforts.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland are tracking common bats and soprano pipistrelles, including the long-eared bat and the Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Tracking devices are installed at key locations across the country to track the activity of bats throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct mobile diagnostic studies using handheld sensors.
Advanced acoustic analyses of all the specimens determine the frequency of the beetles' calls and what each species does.
It then produces a spatial map and report to create a detailed geographic picture of the behaviours.
Rob Dewar, the permanent global philanthropic advisor for NTS, hopes the findings will show which of the habitat areas are most important to bats and how each of the bats uses them.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management practices such as habitat creation and how to protect forests for deer and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the past century.
It is threatened by construction and development projects that affect residential and non-residential areas.
Hoods and lamps are also dangerous, including hidden fishing lures and some synthetic chemicals, and the excrement of pet cats.
The bats are not a pest.
However, due to nighttime sleep habits, the ears are more efficient than the eyes for food digestion.
A sophisticated micro-site technique is used to locate insects and mites in flight paths.
Important to the NTS, it is responsible for the protection of more than 270 traditional houses, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country.
It has ten senior specialists, conducting research, resident examinations and several resuscitations.
A first reserve in Scotland has also been established reserved for ducks only at Threave village in Dumfries and Galloway and is home to eight Scottish duck species out of ten.
The village manager David Thompson said it was the right place for the bats.
"Here in Threave this is a great place for bats", he says.
"Here are all the houses, old trees and good living quarters.
But there are still many unknown features of bats, so work being done here and in other countries will help to better understand what they need to survive".
He spoke highly of the importance of checking for bedbugs before conducting house searches as the rape of a colony resident could potentially kill up to 400 bats and bats and potentially wipe out the entire neighborhood population.
The monkeys are protected, and it is illegal to arm, harass, threaten or abuse the monkeys.
Elisabeth Ferrel, Scotland's chief executive of the Bat Conservation Trust, is encouraging the public to help.
He said: "There is so much to learn about bats and the diversity of our species, we just don't know how these populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies open accusations, lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the open allegations against him "false news", saying they "want to make a joke of themselves" by using his name.
Lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus star has been accused of having opened up to an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep her sober for the trouble, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers after the allegations came to light, Ronaldo, 33, strongly denied the allegations, calling them "false rumors".
No, no, no, no, no.
Their comments today are false news", the Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to make fun of themselves by using my name.
This is a common practice.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's the way it is.
I'm a happy person, I end up doing well", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to acquit Der Spiegel of the charges, saying it "reports unacceptable allegations of a breach of privacy", Reuters reports.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek parliament for "ethical reasons at a scale commensurate with the scale of the crime and one of the biggest civil rights developments in recent years".
This alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that he was contacted by his computers after alleged problems and was told he was "99 percent" a "good person" and that he was "one percent" wrong".
Ronaldo admitted to the papers, but they agreed.
Mayorga also alleges that he went to the police and had pictures of his injuries taken at a hospital, but he agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he "feared arrest", and was concerned he would be publicly prosecuted".
He said, 34 years old, he was trying to reverse the decision as the earthquake was still affecting him because of that condition.
He was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged auction, and this summer he moved to Italian champions Juve for a €100 deal.
Brexit: UK 'forever out' of car manufacturers' takeover
The UK will be 'forever apart' if it loses its position as a post-Brexit hub for transport, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He also said he was "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without permission it would temporarily suspend manufacturing at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We must get permission", said Mr Clark.
The Japanese automaker said jobs could be lost due to the impact of imbalances if no Brexit deal is reached.
About 150,000 cars were built that year at the Burnaston plant - a manufacturer of Toyota's Auris and Avensis - 90% of which were sold in the European Union.
"If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without obtaining approval for how to trade between countries, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
There are serious concerns about the situation which car manufacturers say could jeopardise service lines if there is no deal for Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "continuous cleaning" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for vehicles ordered to be made.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal by 29 March, the balance may be affected by the sanctions, and the alternative solution for the industry is backstop and short-term stages.
Toyota has not been able to maintain a one-day supply of equipment at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production has been suspended.
Mr Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for long-term relations with the EU "was deliberately designed to avoid such investigations in the first place".
"We need to have consent. We want the best possible consent, not for the success we have now but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The demonstrations not only of Toyota and other manufacturers should enable us to continue these highly successful service lines".
Toyota could not say how long such production would be scaled back, but in the long run, the factory's competitiveness would decline as prices rose, and, perhaps, operations would be cancelled.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union organizer for Unite at the factory, said his members are very concerned: "I have seen when jobs are lost it is not for the sake of getting back.
A government spokesman said: "We have laid out a clear and precise plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
The high-probability meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be postponed "for another week", as the fight for top-secretary Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Tuesday.
Rosenstein is the monitor of special counsel Robert Mueller's activities, who is investigating the election success of Roosevelt, ties between Trump aides and Russia and a possible presidential veto.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general would also affect Mueller's impeachment, the top decision-maker in Washington for months.
This month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wiretapping conversations with Trump and a possible plan to impeach the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein disputed this report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, with a flurry of accusations that he was being discriminated against.
Instead, a meeting with Trump for the United Nations was announced while he was in The Big Apple at the time.
Trump said he "didn't want" to fire Rosenstein but held the meeting to avoid clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee ruling that Kavanaugh had testified against one of the women who accused him of rape, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which would also delay the Senate election.
Trump's media secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
Speaking about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date for that has not yet been set, it could be this week and it could be moved to next week because of all the circumstances surrounding the Supreme Court.
But leave it to time and I'm just as keen to inform the media".
Some journalists dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a commentary since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why this was so.
Sanders said that the lack of interest in "proud" television journalists was not the reason for the low ratings, although he added: "I don't dispute the simple statement that they are proud".
He then said that there would be more conversations between Trump and the media.
"The president has more question and answer sessions than any previous president", he said, without providing any evidence for this: "We have looked at those doors".
The explanatory remarks will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has a chance to ask the president of the United States a direct question, that would be better than talking to me.
We try to have more of these, and you've seen a lot of these in recent weeks, and that replaces the media coverage when you talk to the president of the United States".
Trump will answer questions the same way when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions, press conferences and influential guests.
Individual reading sessions are very different.
At The Big Apple this week the president may have demonstrated what it was like, in his speech, sometimes in front of the press when they gathered.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland expressing national condolences to them and asking them to stay put post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP issued a letter within six months of the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying resident claims for EU clerks working in devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "As the summer progresses, negotiations between the UK and the EU continue, leading to decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government is increasingly making amends for a non-consensual arrangement.
I know it can be a difficult time for all of you.
What I wanted to reiterate now is that it's important to me that each and every employee's support activities, regardless of where they come from.
We bring together colleagues from across the EU and beyond with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we would very much like you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie Receives Emergency Medical Care After Brain Injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie received an emergency shoulder injury after suffering a concussion in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters he suffered an injury before the preseason.
"He came to the side and almost fell down", Reed said.
Engineers and medical personnel gave Abercombie oxygen on the side before loading him into a crate and he was taken away for further examination.
A Tennessee State officer told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had emerged from the emergency room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said that "there is no further information on the type/ extent of the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to determine how the injury occurred.
This was Abercrombie's first year of playing, as a sophomore, with Tennessee State following the transfer from Illinois.
He played all five games on Saturday before the game was abandoned, and has played all 18 games this year.
Foreign buyers pay more property tax when they buy a home in the UK
Overseas buyers pay more tax on the mortgage when they buy a home in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people under the Tories' new plans
This trend will hamper the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters
The flat tax is levied on non-taxable people in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will pay more tax on the mortgage when they buy a home in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
Some see this provision as a defense of the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters with promises of more affordable housing and better access for high-income earners.
The levy is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue generated will increase the Government's efforts to eliminate the tax haven.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current flat tax, including the higher amounts introduced two years ago for second homes and retirement homes - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects to receive up to £120 million a year from this.
About 13 percent of new homes built in London are bought by foreign residents, which increases prices, making it harder for first-time home buyers to get a home.
There are not many "multi-city" attractions in the countryside - especially in the capital - because many foreign buyers spend more time abroad.
The new policy has emerged in recent weeks after Boris Johnson called for a flat tax to help more young people get their first home.
He blamed large construction firms for driving up prices by leasing land and not using it, and ordered Mrs May to remove cuts for affordable housing to fix the "residential housing crisis".
Mr Corbyn has announced new construction of green buildings, including rental properties and a halt to "no-fault" construction.
He also wants to give more powers to the councils to create new buildings.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would put my prime minister at risk to save the British dream - a better life for each new generation.
That is, fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and create here.
However, it is not fair that it is easier for non-UK residents, and foreign companies, to buy a house as an active British resident.
For many, the dream of buying a condo is too remote, and the diminishing quality of the dream is too real".
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to govern Scotland"
As manager of Sunderland his "great ambition" was to manage the Scottish team during his time.
The 42-year-old Scottish striker is in the midst of a remarkable recovery at the club, who are in third place in League One, three goals from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership that year.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was playing.
I played for the second team and ended up there", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father as a child, and this is one that keeps me coming back.
But that opportunity will only come if I manage successfully at club level".
Managers before Ross at Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he had no fears of chasing winners at a major club, following criticisms from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me now is 'if I can get this club back to the Premier League?'
With the formation and incorporation of this club, its rightful place is in the Premier League", he said.
"It is not an easy task to come here, but I will only succeed if I bring the club back there".
Ross spent just three years on the management track, following a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and turned St Mirren from relegation to the Championship play-off champions the following year.
Ross said he was at his best now when he played for Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was probably the most extreme", he said of leading Alloa.
"I firmly believe that directing is more right for me than acting.
It can feel different to think that I've done well, had a good life, and reached some good levels.
But it is difficult to play.
You have a lot to do each week.
I still have that about the hustle and bustle of work but I'm right in the middle of it.
I always wanted to run, and I'm doing it now, and this is the most exciting time of my entire adult life".

The best time for a bath is 5.30pm on a Saturday, according to one study
British grocery stores have seen their revenues increase due to the summer lockdown but more pressure has been placed on grocery store listings.
Sales of grocery stores and bars rose 2.7 percent in July - but revenues at grocery stores fell 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "With the sun still setting and England's World Cup qualifying goal being longer than expected, July followed a similar pattern to June, with sales up by 2.8 per cent, but with more heavy downpour at grocery stores.
The discount of 1.8 percent at the grocery store in June was even worse than in July.
Pubs and liquor bars were more active than food stalls.
Food vendors also suffered on bank holidays, but not as severely as grocery store managers.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
Across bars and pubs, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, a RSM entertainment and hospitality analyst, said: "He has been working on these solutions since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social gatherings or events always play a major role in influencing sales at the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the grocery sector continues to struggle, although it will suffer a significant decline of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year, and with continuing pressure on prices.
The long hot summer season was particularly bad for food service executives, and would have been a sign of whether the Hurricane would be easier to contain in colder temperatures".
Total sales across department stores and grocery stores, including new openings, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in the production of the species.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industrial sales tracker collects and analyzes for the grocery, bars and restaurants sector, performance data from 47 management teams and aggregate assets of over £9 billion and is the industry standard for the industry.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - have hidden social media accounts from their parents and teachers, research shows
A study of 20,000 high school students found that the growth of "Insta and social" pages
Fears have been raised that these shows are being censored for sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "parent" record to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - are creating social media accounts and hiding them from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a bowl-sized volume of "Insta meho" accounts - references to a photo-sharing site Instagram.
Fears have been raised that these shows are being censored for sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "parent" account to show to their parents and had one of their own.
A mother was at the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, where she saw a teenager ordering others to "push me".
The survey, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two accounts, and half of them revealed that they had a secret account.
HMC chair Mike Buchanan said: "It's very frustrating that so many young people have taken their minds off creating online spaces that their parents and teachers don't see".
Eilidh Doyle becomes "voice for the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual meeting.
The Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious racing venue and stadium, and chairman Ian Beattie said it was a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from its extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish journalism community, the UK and internationally, and we believe Scotland will greatly benefit from a visit from you to the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I would very much like to be a voice for the players and hopefully I can be a real supporter and help lead the sport in Scotland",
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta in his four Olympic medals and is now a BBC commentator, has been unable to compete due to the effects of transient ischemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: One month ago I suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.
I can't catch it.
The doctors told me that the time would tell if I would ever come back to life or how I would feel.
It was hard work but I'm back to life, I've learned to fish again, and today I'm laying eggs!
I miss the encouraging messages!"
Continuous map reading compares mothers to cows divided by online opinion
The map company has divided the online experience into a reading that matches mothers breastfeeding babies to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be the world's first cow lip balm, technology company Elvie released a video-animated balm reading to show the freedom the new balm offers to pregnant mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn are replaced by a monkey and a song is played that carries words like: "Yes, I'll milk myself, but you can't see the curse", and "If you haven't noticed these aren't animal shelters, they're my friends".
The voice conference goes on: "Swim outside, swim outside, I feed those babies, swim outside, swim outside, I milk my wives".
However, the leak, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked an online controversy.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, some calling it a repudiation of the bull industry's "craziness".
"It was a very bad decision to read this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and reproduce to produce milk, but their young are weaned at the end of a few days after birth, one writer wrote.
The Elvie's moth penetrates the mammalian nest (Elvie/Mother)
Another says: "The analogy is clear for mother and baby.
But, well, why use them to read the chart of the mothers who still hold their babies?
Another adds: A foolish reader.
Others interrupt the reading, with a woman singing a pukukata to him.
I think this is a crazy idea.
I will get one if I continue to breastfeed.
I am as a cow when I am weary.
This may sound silly but I know it is.
This is a fictional result, wrote one.
Another says: "It's a fun read that focuses on mothers who are sleeping (sometimes in their workplaces or bathrooms) and thinking they're pregnant".
This is not a reading that favors or condemns the cattle industry.
At the end of the video the female group reveals themselves dancing with trembling maps wrapped around their waists.
The motivation for the experiment came from the realization that many women would be brainwashed into thinking they were the same as a cow.
However, the Elvie's moth has very empty lips, no wire or spines, and is able to enter the mammalian nest spontaneously, allowing the females to move, lift their young, and release them while suckling.
Ana Balarin, an entrepreneur and ECD partner, told Mother: "Because the Elvie Map is a hybrid product, a light and vibrant launch was required.
By comparing a woman who is a cow and a cow we aim to show a map of the world with all the challenges of choice, and show the fun and challenging path, the ever-increasing direction towards freedom that the new map will take.
This was not the first time the Elvie map had entered the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother with two children was seen on a cat ladder for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Young Boys Celebrate Moving a Cannon to the Field
The number of immigrant children incarcerated has risen sharply despite the border crossing not having changed significantly, partly because of the negotiations and heavy-handed policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it harder to place children with supporters.
In the past, the defendants were often undocumented immigrants and feared that their ability to remain on the island would be jeopardized by the advances of the child prostitution.
The crisis escalated in June, when the investment banking authorities ordered that asylum seekers and other adult members of their households be given asylum and be distributed to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official from the Department of Children and Families, testified before the Assembly that several people who had asked to support unaccompanied minors had been detained.
The agency admitted that 70 percent of those detained had no criminal convictions.
About 80 percent of people who are refugees or people from refugee homes live in this island, and a large proportion of those are illegal immigrants.
So we are still following those people", says Albence.
Seeking to speed up the process of detaining children, officials issued new rules that would require some to appear before the court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, the usual earlier period, according to prosecutors.
Many people appear via video conference, rather than physically, to present their case for legal status to an immigrant judge.
Those who were deemed unfit to sit grew rapidly.
Children are too long-term and more likely to have memory or emotional problems, which can lead to abnormalities or reproductive tests, according to statistics and reports that have surfaced in the system in recent months.
Advocates say such concerns are more acute in a large center like Tornillo, who often shows no signs of survival because of his size.
They add that sending children to the big city without time to prepare their meals or to circle with friends increases the risk of those children being bullied.
Syria is calling on its American, French and Turkish residents to evacuate immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called for the return of Syrian refugees, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, also the deputy prime minister, said that the rebels, who are living in exile in Syria, are fighting to liberate it and will be punished.
"They should be brought out immediately without charge", he told the assembly.
Moualem called for a nearly completed crackdown on violence in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said that the work of Tamaki  will continue fighting this holy war until all areas of Syria  are cleared of separatist groups and a criminal code is implemented.
There are 2,000 American troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops on the island's territory have been dispersed since the war.
Regarding the monkeys, Moualem said that conditions were good for them to return and that he would protect the West Indies from the feared tsunami where the monkeys were forced to live permanently.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to manage these returns", he said.
They are politicising the human cause, not the other way around.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no renewed aid will be provided for Syria unless a political agreement between Assad and the coalition is reached to end the conflict.
UN officials say a new agreement between Russia and Iraq to establish a buffer zone at the last major air base in Idlib has created the possibility for political talks to move forward.
The Russia-Turkey conflict has been the most significant attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
Moualem explained that a clear "decision" for consent and expression of intent is military action that targets jihadists including militants from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which is responsible for the attacks.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura wants to call the first meetings for the new committee composed of government and security officials to draft a post-war constitution for Syria leading to elections.
Moualem made recommendations for the Syrian government to be included in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to reviewing articles of the current state constitution and warning of possible violations.
Why James Fights the Second Battle
On that basis, Mita Tānapu will win re-election in 2020 if his presidency does not end early in the election and title, some pundits may hope.
No doubt this is the ultimate solution to the eternal presidency!
At this point, there is no sign that viewers are getting tired.
As of 2014, big-time ratings had more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on major news outlets.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it is not what we understand", said Neal Baer, the program director of ABC's Designated Survivor, "for the cabinet secretary who would become president before the Capitol was opened".
Nell Scovell, a veteran writer of silent comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has proposed a different theory.
He recalls a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver says he will vote for Mita Tapu.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he's making fun of me,'" Scovell told me.
There is a recreational value in the approach.
No doubt, unlike anything else on TV, the narrative frames that emerge from the British establishment determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
The lack of attention is a distraction that can make even the most wealthy spectators.

Foreign currency flooding into nearest House election contests
It was no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th saw a flood of settlers, as the re-establishment of incorporated settlements put the two settlers in a single race for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh suburban district was recently reorganized to include Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election in that district.
Lamb is competing with another resident, Reeve Keith Rothfus, a representative for Pennsylvania's old 12th district, who is strongly in favor of the new 17th.
Plans were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old neighborhoods had been subdivided in favor of the Separatists.
The competition for the new 17 started a trial funding battle between the finance branches of the main parties, the Democratic Control Coordinating Committee (DCCC) and the National Resistance Coordinating Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's news came after a near-miss in the highly-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Democrat has held the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 seats.
Political experts say Democrats are close, but ahead.
US considers rescue aid to China, then retaliates
Interlocutors claim that Dominica and Panama have already recognized Peixoto, with no indication of British involvement.
Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and was granted a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization's management team was ousted by business partners.
Officials from the US State Department will decide to recall the heads of US interim missions in The Hague, Dominica and Panama for new assignments so as not to offend Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the states that were previously considered for the Recovery Act received, according to estimates, $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, regulatory and economic support.
The repressed communities, including the cuts in financial aid and the prohibition of cannabis, were deeply entrenched in the Central American nation with high unemployment and low inflation.
As the domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America moved the main meeting focused on security and economic stability to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward for efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made clear they wanted the meeting to continue, so the decision was made to cancel The Recovery.
Vice President Mike Pence is said to be speaking at the summit, which is currently scheduled for mid-November, to highlight the importance of the summit to the administration, officials said.
And the ambassadors returned safely to La Salva, Panama and Dominica unhappy with the heavy ambassadors or the Chinese delegations.
A White House representative for Mike Bolton declined to comment on the details of the conflict as three American officials, including two mediators, agreed to discuss internal resolutions on the matter and keep them confidential.
Those comments were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and discussed on the condition that they remain confidential.
Learn about history
The latest piece of evidence to fall is the report by private investigator Robert Mueller on the possible legalization of marijuana, which now has ample evidence against the public prosecution.
Reports suggest that Mr. Mueller will change his investigation to see if the Trump and Russia conspiracy worked together to influence our elections.
If the nature of The Union were to be changed, Mithras would be responsible for that party, both before his appearance before the electors and possibly before the critics of his allies.
There are too many cases, and I'm not saying that Mithras - and his counterparts in Europe - will not fail.
We all have choices on both sides of the Atlantic that influence life expectancy.
By 1938, German officers were ready to establish a presence in Switzerland, if only the West would resist him and support the Germans in Munich.
We fell, and were left with the ability to avoid the next generation of replicators.
The course of history is fraught with such changing times, and the endless expansion of democracy makes it faster or slower.
The people of the United States today face many times of change.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who was in charge of the outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper was published, last year, when he tried to secretly arrest the president on charges of being unfit for office.
Michael Rosenstein says that The Times's explanatory report is vague.
How do we react if the new F.B.I. investigation ordered on Brett Kavanaugh is not satisfactory or accurate - or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of transparency and conspiracy?
And more importantly, will we vote for the middle-of-the-road coalitions that ensure that the Democratic Party is held accountable?
If we fail those tests, the winter of democracy will last.
But I believe we should not be confused, because of the course I studied in Prague.
My mother was a German refugee who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied my adopted home at one time.
He was exiled and moved to America, and 60 years ago, I volunteered to light a Christmas candle on that table that held the swastika.
If this is my offer, how can I not feel anxious about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers had a heart attack before the match against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, recognising that the draw against Austria, after a crucial match in Belgium against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to make it out of Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from his first appearance in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that solution to kick off more important matches.
"We have a good score because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game believing we would win something and left with a score.
It may be that we can finally cut it, but the equation may have a correct solution.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Thursday was another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points but it will be a difficult game because they will finish well in their last game but, if all three of us support us, I know we will go ahead and get a good result.
It was a difficult year, all my injuries and differences with the club but things are looking good now.
The team was good and the boys were very good at this time, with good training.
Hope, moving forward now, forgets that moment and succeeds.

While survey respondents had very clear ideas about how to care for themselves, few of them discussed the topic with their relatives.
Half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their peers about the cost of environmental care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about the subject.
"People want to protect themselves, but they're not prepared to talk", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance business Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not inform them of your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to protect yourself, as those choices are crucial to knowing what the cost is.
Your financial advisor can help you to prepare a way to pay those fees.
Your financial options for car insurance are the traditional car insurance policy, as well as a dual-benefit insurance policy to support replacement of these costs, which insures you against your own assets - if you have the right amount.
Organize your legal forms: Avoid legal battles in the narrowest possible way.
Set up a healthcare network so that you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and have experts set up to assess your wishes if you cannot speak.
Similarly, consider a power of attorney for your claims.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure payment of your bills if you are unemployed.
Don't forget the little details: Your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and pain medications?
Draw those details on a drawing map so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the doctors who are the problem, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

A man was shot multiple times at a gas station in Ilfracombe
One man was shot multiple times with a gas canister as he was driving home after a night of entertainment.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was stabbed in the chest, neck and arm.
Officers described the explosion, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as an "incidental event".
The archer did not see his archer.

The continental and tropical oceans in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died in a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian capital of Palu, officials say, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications down, rescue officials were unable to hear any information from the Donggala royal government, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster hit.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow peninsula on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a kingdom that stretches over 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The prefecture, an administrative subdivision of the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, which is particularly dependent on the coastal area of Donggala.
Concrete mining is important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the Pacific coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have experienced tropical cyclones at some point in the last 100 years, according to the Center for Disaster Risk Management.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of houses were flooded in Donggala.
A tsunami struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies at the edge of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is a landlocked country.
Here are some of the major landforms and tropical cyclones in recent years.
2004: A major landslide off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 islands, killing 226,000 people around the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the capital city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre high tsunami that submerged the port cities and killed at least 300 people.
2016: A devastating earthquake affects the Pidie Jaya kingdom in Aceh, inspiring a reaction and a stirring public memory of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami began at this time, but more than 100 people died in collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the island's coast.
The landslide pushed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists without access to roads.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor for Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been jailed for violent crimes.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on a warrant for domestic violence, resisting domestic violence investigations and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and stated "not guilty, absolutely not" when asked about his key, which the association reported.
There are three Class A misdemeanors, which means that you could face imprisonment for not less than one year and a fine of $250,000.
It is also a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, she was accused of killing her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, calls the police to investigate the alleged rape.
The case is still pending in the Alaska Fisheries Court.
In the 2016 Census she was charged with domestic violence, abusing the domestic violence crime reporting and getting into a gunfight while intoxicated about the act.
His girlfriend alleged that he kissed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by gay rights groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his deployment to Iraq.
A landslide in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and pushed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have collapsed and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake has affected the outer margin of central Sulawesi, an area around the centre of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
A video circulating on the social media site shows the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered for a mass rally in the capital city of Palu, after which the tsunami hit the city.
Investment bankers seek murder suspect for NYC open court trial
Investment bank prosecutors in New York are seeking a murder weapon for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged mastermind of a New York City bank robbery that killed eight people - a rare weapon not used in the real estate sector for investment bank crime after 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot pickup truck to drive a bicycle to a cycle path on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, cutting down walks and cyclists before leaving in November.
To clear the murder charge, defendants must charge Saipov with killing eight journalists and with causing grievous bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to find the murder charge, filed with the New York Department of Corrections.
In both cases the murder charge is capable of being committed, according to court documents.
In the weeks following the raid, the massive investment turnover was met with a 22-count indictment including eight felony counts of conspiracy to support the criminal enterprise, a charge often used by investment bankers in classified criminal cases, and a charge of racketeering and auto theft.
The opening required a "planned and premeditated act", critics say, describing Saipov's use of the character as a "spoiler, a spoiler and a joke".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted pain, suffering, and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini including Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the opinion piece states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was a decade after the New York City Police Department had been investigating a homicide case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of harassing illegal drug dealers but was eventually commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a New York investment case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple of prisoners executed after being blacklisted for spying for the Former Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of slowing down in the days and months after the release, according to court documents.
He told witnesses that he liked his actions, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was encouraged to use the crackdown after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the investment public defender representing Saipov, said they were clearly not satisfied with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to find the killer, rather than accepting a guilty verdict and serving life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the burden of these proceedings for all those affected", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to find the murder weapon.
A Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be made Brexit negotiator.
Nigel Farage vowed to free the same man today in a debate with the Tory party.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be wary of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's MPs insisted she should be allowed to be a regulatory regulator in the EU.
The promoter behind the change, Peter Bone, has said that the Birmingham strike would be the UK's last if Michael Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in reuniting her deeply divided teams has been echoed by pro-Remain Conservatives who have engaged in a separate Brexit debate in the capital.
The prime minister is eager to continue to push through her Chequers number plan amidst protests from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Investments are soaring and he continues to work to cement the agreement with Brussels despite the extreme odds - and to force Eurosceptics and Libyans to choose between his candidacy and Brexit.
Mith Bone told the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he was interested in getting more Chequers.
He insisted that Mr Farage be released as a fugitive and given the task of managing the arrangements in Brussels.
"If it was the manager, we would be out of here now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I stand by Brexit but we must beat Chequers".
Asserting his commitment to the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world wars to be slaves.
We like to make our own laws on our own island.
Mr Bone dismisses the perception that public opinion has changed after the 2016 election: "The perception is that British people have changed their minds and have become too lazy to be a realist".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was there at the rally, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is a slap in the face to the general public, who don't vote for Africans, a slap in the face to our party and our critics who hijack the streets and use it to get us elected first.
Please destroy Chequers and start listening.
In a sharp message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime ministers can hold on to their positions if they keep their oaths".
Farage told the conference that politicians should use the heat to make sure they are close to ratifying the resolution used in the 2016 referendum.
"There is a matter of trust between us - the people - and political will", he said.
They want to delay Brexit, and we are here today to say we will not allow you to do that.
In a message to the three young people he added: "I would like you to embrace our political appeal, which is about to intensify Brexit, and feel the heat".
`We are denying the people of this island who voted for Brexit, and will not do so until we are an independent, sovereign, and democratic Britain.
At the time, the Remainers were still campaigning in Birmingham before establishing a two-hour meeting in the city's main square.
A few critics hailed the Tories Against Brexit flags after the party launched this weekend.
The Reverend Lord Adonis mocked the Reformers for security reasons that involved them in a riot at the opening of the meeting.
"These are people who tell us they can provide all the IT systems and technology for Canada, which is, for a no-fly zone, for free trade and no borders to Ireland", he added.
It's very boring.
Brexit is not good", he added.
Warren prepares to look forward to the presidential race
Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will look to run for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his past in a western Massachusetts town hall on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, the vice chairman of Trump's 2016 bid.
He is among the rumors that he will compete with Tapu in 2020.
The Saturday evening performance in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with his constituents using the city hall framework after Tanner took office.
Someone in attendance asked if he was considering running for president.
Warren has responded that it is time for women to go to Britain to fix our broken government, including the woman at the top.
One has been trapped in the LSU shooting death of Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of baseball player Wayde Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the capture of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was stabbed with a single gunshot wound to the head, which resulted in his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde is eager to intervene on his friend's behalf, and Simpson is eager to help.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been there, and received a beating from the anger, and confessed that Wayde Sims had shot him.
Simpson is unlawfully detained and held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 senior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts that season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the world title after team commands put the weight on Sebastian Vettel
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas was tied ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team commands would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and Hamilton nearly fell when he broke his position in the first two laps and asked Vettel to release his teammate.
Vettel enters the ring and leaves Hamilton to enter the car at the group stage, as if it were a decision.
Mercedes entered the race to roll the corner ahead and behind Vettel, but Hamilton pulled out after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver clear the inside lane with a stall after a second move to intercept the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the final lap of the race and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He led for the majority of the race and maintained his chances of breaking the fastest lap and beating Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
Meike entered the rings on lap 44 but could not increase his speed on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen won the fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had a fun job all weekend and was so quiet after ordering me to leave the bus.
The team did a fantastic job to get to second place", said Hamilton.
The Danger of Body Language
Senator Dianne Feinstein was taunted by Senator Donald Trump at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not release a letter by Christine Blasey Ford alleging that Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court appointment was blocked.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not fully address the introduction Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that the Senate's actions had shown that some people were "scampers and thugs and hypocrites".
"One thing that happens and that is the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in Hindi, when you see anger, when you see people angry, cheering, yelling, swearing", he said.
If you look at the emissions and leaks and their keywords, that's not me.
That's not me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you the leak?
Remember his answer...you filled out the form - "Oh, oh, what?"
No, not at all.
I didn't leak.
So, wait a minute.
We leaked...No, we didn't leak", he added, in the senator's case.
Feinstein was served with the letter preparing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in June and was released before September - but Feinstein denied the rumor that the leak came from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
He asked for secrecy and kept it as he asked.
But he did not dispute the president's statement, which he said at a Saturday night conference: "As I said, that body language is very bad".
Maybe not, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
His intervention continues in the Supreme Court case, which has been accused of a sexual assault by three women, the President thought the Democrats were using the accusations to support their own interests.
They have been determined to regain power no matter how it is restored.
You see the celebration, the manicure, and what they do to get people to understand, what they break to gain power and control, Mediaite reports the president's keynote.
Championship play: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars improved on their league title defeat on Friday to the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 replay against Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants would be led by second-string quarterbacks Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home run before the Giants regained the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to seal the deal.
The third defeat to the Reds in this match was for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth straight meeting between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford had to help the second to stay ahead four minutes later.
In the shutout period, Sullivan returned to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered as a substitute for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants came out ahead before coming to break the ice on his second goal of the night at the end of the first quarter.
The home team rallied again and Bouchard scored again with a powerful field goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game near the end of the second half, and he secured a fifth-place finish for his team in the semi-final.
The Giants, who had lost four of their previous five games, will play Milton Keynes at home for that game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller dies to stop airplane emissions
An airline operator in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died while confirming that the plane carrying hundreds of people had safely left the airport.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a major landslide hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a cyclonic storm.
The area is filled with squatters and many are caught in the bustle of the capital city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues' demands for their release, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refuses to give up his position in the tower guarding the airport terminal at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, on the landing strip at the time, was capable of a safer flight.
He then jumped from the air traffic control tower when he mistakenly jumped.
Wait until he dies in the hospital.
The representative for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that hundreds of aircraft may have been hijacked by his decision, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged a flight from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to greet him at a larger hospital in another major city.
He accidentally disappeared from us this morning before the ship reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear this", he added.
At the time, authorities were concerned that the death toll could reach thousands and the national emergency management agency said the entrance to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was blocked.
The volume is expected to continue to rise as there are many under-balanced risks and many that cannot be eliminated, said industry representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres were recorded in Palu which was undergoing heavy flooding on Sunday.
Both military and commercial aircraft carry relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, emergency vehicles bring in patients.
It is difficult to see natural light.
Sub-markets have been affected everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the exiles but we don't know what they will find there.
It is a loss, but it can be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo will arrive in Palu on Sunday and tell the country's military: I ask you to work day and night to complete all the work related to the massacre.
Are you ready? reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by landslides in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air New Guinea says one person missing after shadow plane crash
The airline that crashed in the Pacific in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after previously saying that all 47 passengers and crew on board the aircraft were safely evacuated.
Air New Guinea said in a statement on Saturday evening that it could not account for the male passenger.
The airline is working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for passenger details, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from that village helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officers said on Friday seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What is the source of the collision and the exact sequence of the events are still not fully understood.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the shadow near the landing site.
Some observers thought the plane had reached the back of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane's approach was too slow.
"It's very good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said they and others were able to put the hips into the emergency exits on the aircraft that was flying.
His key is to sing and dance, and he thinks that the singers will get a little head bang.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors were working to improve a canal that had helped to rescue the captives by using a steamboat to ferry people ashore before the aircraft sank in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in crashes involving registered carriers in PNG over the past two decades but Air New Guinea was not included.
One analyst placed the timeline of the night a woman was cremated.
The prosecutor's case on Saturday ended a retrial for a man accused of killing a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Analyst from the Department of Mathematics Paul Rowlett has presented several oxygens as expert observers in the field of cognitive analysis.
He was accused of switching his use of cell phone intercepts to match the movements of 29-year-old criminal defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old prostitute Jessica Chambers, on the night he was killed.
Rowlett claimed he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Chambers and Tellis the night of his death, contradicting his earlier allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at all times and he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the stands on Saturday and showed that he was out of town that day.
When investigators questioned whether Tellis's claims were true when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another source says Tellis had known Chambers for only two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records show that they only knew each other for about a week.
Rowlett claims that at some point before Chambers died, Tellis deleted notes, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
He will take away his salvation, saith Jehovah.
The defense is set to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the verdict to be reversed later that day.
The High Breed: What is the Sheepdog?
A trio of sheep tries to challenge the negative perception of this species by filling their music with friendly messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims the sheep moved beyond its source of political messages and social issues.
They want to return to its roots and support the revived sheep.
Bands such as the Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in the UK with bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A NY nanny will divorce a couple for rape after the spelling hissar
A New York resident sues a couple for sexual assault after receiving a written statement from the mother complaining that she is also black.
Both deny that they are racist, and advocate the homophobia of the Japanese.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern at learning that new childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
NO ONE WANTS to be a man, wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a letter.
However, it was not given to her husband, but instead to Miti Maurice, a twin.
He admits his mistake and the Plasco-Flaxman Affair has dismissed Maurice, saying the outgoing nurse, an African-American, did not perform well and was already waiting in the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice Dreams is paid for his one day's work and driven home via Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for a salary for rape and is earning a salary in the amount of $350 per day for a six-month, fixed-term job, even though there is no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's hateful".
The pair have responded to accusations of discrimination, saying that terminating Maurice's role was the right thing to do, fearing they would not be able to reconcile after they had offended him.
My girlfriend gave me something she didn't have a key to.
He is not prejudiced.
We are not racist", her boyfriend told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who made you a god, even if it was just a mistake?
Your new baby?
It says, it says.
Preparing the ceremony for the wedding, Plasco said that his girlfriend was only two months pregnant and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you follow such a person?
That's not ideal, the investment banker added.
With the legal case ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to insult the couple on social media, lashing out at them for their behavior and rationale.
Paddington critics feared that readers would not relate to the story, the show's new character.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the spirits of a person reading it for the first time before it's printed.
It is ironic that we now know what we know about the Paddington giant squid.
She says that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before a small toy maker inspired her to write the children's book, was easily criticized for his work, adding that the book's character's 60th birthday was a "sweet and sour" one after his death that year.
Of Paddington, he describes him as "an important member of our family", adding that his father was a bit of a soft-spoken idiot but he succeeded.
"He was a quiet person and not a violent person", she said.
But because Paddington is so real to him, like a child who has accomplished something: you're a fool even if you're not the one doing it.
To me his view of Paddington's adventure was very similar.
Despite his creativity and his wit he still paid homage to Paddington.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she was in her late teens her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, and doctors tried desperately to revive her.
"Nad kept calling to say it was too bad and it was not expected that he would survive", said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad got a call saying that he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
That's what I do.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll come to you now.
I will come to you.
The contractions doctors gave him to restore his breathing were slowly fading and separating his system.
He had just died before this, and this was the end.
I just have to sit and wait, knowing this is opening up.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was in the context of being surrounded by families and people.
I have to be patient.
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now in danger of losing her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - and their ignorance of the tragedy about her.
"No one knew", he said.
My head was shaking and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on this line I heard a great psychoanalysis about Nad.
He wants my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him.
A woman is holding cards to prevent suicides on a staircase.
Two women who have died by suicide each year work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys pin cards to the stairs as well as text messages and phone numbers that allow people to call for support.
Son Mitty Davis was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want a parent to think what I think every day", she says.
Misty Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a heavy dietitian and a syrup smoker.
He was known for being a good shot by everyone.
They always said he lit a cigarette in a room.
However, he stopped working before his death, as he was going through a period of mild depression.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was on his way to see his brother after he committed suicide.
Miti Davis says: "I always feel like there's an inspiration that comes from it".
The cards are designed by Miti Davis, to let people know that you have people you can meet and talk to, including a friend.
Don't be idle - you have to talk.
Mitch Humphreys, a friend of Mitch Davies for many years, lost Mark, his friend for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say it was depression or depression or anything else", she said.
THE day before Christmas we noticed a change in her personality.
He's been to the bottom since Christmas Day - when kids opened their pants without a face mask or anything like that.
He says his death is a great loss for them, but they must work to get out: "A gun will be fired at the family.
We are divided.
But we must keep going, we must keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's background is debatable when the FBI began the sting
"I think if we got something that was almost exactly what he asked for - a temporarily and gradually bounded intersection - then perhaps a unity would come about", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be disrupted by a more permanent move to integrity.
Why did Kavanaugh and his dissident supporters want the FBI to shut down?
The uncertainty is about time.
The midterm elections are five weeks later, on November 6 - if, like the elections, the Democrats do poorly, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to get their candidate elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush had made phone calls to Senate members, urging them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his girlfriend Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
Elections to the Senate, which currently has 51 Seats and 49 Democrats.
It is currently unclear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes on the Senate floor, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to place the same and admit him to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees will decrease under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, who checks data from the Southern Poverty Law Center, reported 1,127 deaths last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that strengthening the border control between North Korea and China, and the higher price the kidnappers are asking for are key issues.
Pyongyang has no public statements.
Most of the North Korean migrants who entered the data were from South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally after the Korean War ended in 1953.
It is mostly crossed by China, which has the longest barrier to North Korea, and is more easily crossed than the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
In China, refugees are illegal immigrants, not creditors, and are often returned with a heavy hand.
Relations between the North and South - which seem to be constantly at war - have escalated in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks based on existing nuclear disarmament arrangements.
This comes after a memorable meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to broad terms to deal with the nuclear-free state of Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Defense Minister denounced US sanctions for not moving before that time.
"If America is not trusted, we have no interest in our national security, so we will not eliminate our weapons of mass destruction if we are alone in the first place", Lee said in a speech to the United Nations in New York.
Brett Kavanaugh is called a "Badass" by Nancy Pelosi and says he cannot provide for the Supreme Court.
Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court appointment was called "unreasonable" by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and was not eligible for the Supreme Court due to its nature.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday with the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't imagine otherwise if the woman had made such a statement, it would have been called a 'no,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has been vocal in denouncing the allegations he made against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were still teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very vocal, sometimes near the stage and crying as he talked about his family and college years.
He is clearly critical of Democrats on the committee, saying the criticisms against him are "a vicious and ruthless circle" organized by gangs angry about Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believed Kavanaugh's testimony justified what she could not provide to the Supreme Court, because it showed her hatred of Democrats.
"I think he's going to dismiss himself because of the comments and the way he's been criticizing the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if she was confirmed and if Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if she hadn't spoken directly to the Federation or the FBI, she wouldn't be eligible for the Supreme Court, including the court she sits on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi adds that as a Democrat she is concerned about the adverse judgments on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was considered a conservative judge.
In his acceptance statements, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a racist, abusive person to enter the courtroom and say, 'Where are we from?'" said Pelosi.
Women should be held accountable.
It is fair to say that anger is a phenomenon of months and years, and it will not be expressed unless it is provoked.
"We cry when we're angry", Steve Steinem told me 45 years later.
I suppose that's not surprising, is it?
He continued, "A woman who was a supervisor at a place stopped me and said she would cry when she was angry, but she made a rule when she was angry and cried, and said to the person, 'You may be wrong that I am crying because it is dark.
I'm angry.
Then he continued on.
I think it's wonderful.
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger because there is nothing to be ashamed of.
One of my fondest memories of working in the morning, in an office full of men, when I was expressing an inexpressible anger, an older woman - a cold manager who had intimidated me - grabbed my bag and pulled me to the step.
"Don't let anyone see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're being discriminatory.
They always seem to be a bit gloomy and happy that you've fallen for them.
Patricia Schroeder, then a female congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was arrested for a robbery on a boat named Monkey Business and after leaving the race, Mr. Schroeder, in his extreme frustration, decided there was no reason he should not be ashamed of the fact that he was running for president.
"It was not a deliberate decision", she said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were seven different candidates in that race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
It is named after a White bear with seven horns.
Being too late in the trial, he was too late for the cash prize and vowed not to enter the race unless the $2 million was raised.
It was a war of attrition.
He found that his supporters gave $1,000 to the man, giving only $250.
"Do they still consider me a discount?" she thought.
When he reveals that he will not launch an official trial, because of the contamination of the media - thanks to the people who supported him, the anger at the system that made it harder to cash in and out of voters rather than candidates, and the anger at the stigmatization of women - he almost cries.
"If you mistakenly think I'm a near-deadbeat", recalled Misty Schroeder of the press's reaction to her.
Kleenex may be mistaken for my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my memorial stone?
He cried?
How the U.S.-China trade war for Beijing will work.
The initial stages of the trade war between the United States and China were horrendous, and although the war was too long to finish, the division between the two nations made for a successful nuclear war, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, blocked the first warning this year by imposing tariffs on China's main exports including platinum, steel and aluminum.
The main increase this week came in foreign sales taxes affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which tax about half of all US goods imported from China.
China has always been so wealthy, but recently it has been charging a foreign sales tax of between five and ten percent on US$60 billion worth of assets.
China has vowed to make America a bomb-to-bomb equivalent, and the world's second largest economy is not about to be toppled.
The British would have to back down and accept the offers, but the public outcry in America was a major embarrassment to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if the use of cards is justified, the U.S. difficulties in the trade war will favor China in the global market by reducing the linkage of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision on either the British or the Americans could create conditions that would trigger economic migration to either of the islands is more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, a communications researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is desperate for loans to return, says Minister Polla
Syria has said it is ready for the return of the rebels and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been crippled by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was escalating.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, as we move forward with the open war", he said.
The government continues to liberate areas that have been delayed by the opening up to normal reconstruction.
There are all sorts of conditions for the voluntary return of migrants to the country they left due to liberalisation and unilateral economic policies that have disrupted their daily lives and activities.
UN estimates put the number of Syrian refugees at more than 5.5 million since the start of the war in 2011.
There are six million people living on the island who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian authorities would welcome help in rebuilding the decimated island.
But he chose not to accept humanitarian aid or aid from the islands that supported the invasion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup final in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team America by 16.5 points to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. now has six close ties on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The crown was returned to Europe when Team Captain Thomas Bjorn's team finished 14.5 points clear of the American champions.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the backup for most of the game, introduced his water-skiing shotgun at the 3-hole cut, giving his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian striker Molinari crossed all of his legs, becoming the 1st of 4 players to come back from 5-0-0 down since the current league structure was introduced in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the US 5&4 was beaten by the European team's lower-level player Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2 to 1 to Ian Poulter of England who was playing in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Beninese Sergio Garcia became the most successful European in the event with a score of 25.5.
I don't usually cry but I can't stop today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy to get the cup again.
For the team, and I'm glad I was able to help", said Garcia, a hearing specialist after the European tour.
The light was given to his own native John Ram who beat the famous Tiger Woods 2&1 flyweight in the singles on Sunday.
"The biggest criticism I have, to quote Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four games to France and his current record of 13-21-3 is the career record for the Ryder Cup.
A different statistic is one of the greatest news broadcasters, having won 14 titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA was on the air all weekend to see the valleys of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played quality acoustics around the entire stadium.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the game for his team, "I'm so angry at these guys, they're going to fight".
We were in Europe this morning.
We will fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
It is an important cap.
All 12 of his players played well.
I'm going to get back together, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 pieces, and I'm excited to provide a capsule.
The hat should be knitted.
They play better.
Red Coast resurgence: The storms descend into Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in Red Sea turtles in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, a series of tornadoes have been reported in parts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a declining tornado.
The Red Sea is a strip of land extending about 130 miles along the coast from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Some of the quakes were found about 10 miles outside of Hillsborough County, but in smaller areas compared to that week.
Red Beach has also been found in Pasco County.
Medium-sized tornadoes in or out of Pinellas County have been reported in the past week, with minor tornadoes to the highest outside of Hillsborough County, minor tornadoes to the highest in Manatee County, minor tornadoes to the highest in Charlotte County, minor tornadoes to the highest in or out of Lee County, and minor tornadoes to the highest in Collier County.
Traffic congestion is reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No traffic congestion was reported in Northwest Florida during the past week.
