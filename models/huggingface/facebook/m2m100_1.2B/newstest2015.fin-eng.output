The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The city council unanimously approved the agreement on Monday.
The city council approved the agreement last week.
The Tuusniemi municipality was also involved in the investigation of the municipality, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next local elections will be held in 2016.
After the joining of Juankoski, Kuopio’s population is approximately 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev on Monday of refusing to engage in direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current leadership of Kiev is unwilling to conduct a major political discussion with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, whom Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian military, were trying to push the Ukrainian troops away from their current locations where Putin said the Ukrainian military forces were shooting civilians.
The objective of the militants is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrm reparatorium.
I was surprised that the crowd had arrived early in the evening.
Visitors were expected in two days, promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are going to continue to be hip-hop festivals, that is, pop is not allowed, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law will enter into force on Tuesday, limiting the procurement of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply for permission from the Police Government to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as so-called precursors to explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chloride, potassium peroxide, sodium chloride and sodium peroxide and mixtures containing them where specified concentrations are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in cleaning and washing products, but concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration.
However, precursors acquired before the entry into force of the law may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of rape in two hotels is awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing in the High Court of Glasgow.
She is accused of rape at the Pitlochry Scotland’s Hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking the woman “when she is unconscious, asleep, and thus being unable to make a decision on her own.”
Webster is also accused of rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nuremberg on May 4, 2014.
According to Judge Lady Rae’s decision, the trial will be held at the High Court of Edinburgh on 17 November.
Super League: Super Raheem brilliant - Mario left in the shadow - Super League - Evening News
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is seen as the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli-backed Liverpool arrived at Tottenham as a guest.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude than at the time of Manchester City.
Balotelli was far from the top.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen pitches to his own team.
Fans who have already taken the player as their favourite will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the star of the team was Raheem Sterling, the head of the midfield diamond, who struck the 3-0 victory over the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, is not just shining with his power.
An Englishman 20 centimeters shorter than Balotell is between the lines of the opponent than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who boasts grass at its best at about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserves great appreciation for Sterling’s development.
The Northern Irishman told us after the match how Liverpool has systematically developed from a Northwestern to a more holistic player that grew up at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the supercappellist of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City Council of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next supercappellist of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
Even the Los Angeles Times has been asking which orchestra he is next.
Susanna Mälkki says she starts her new job with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in the country’s musical life for over a hundred years, including by performing a large number of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he said.

After that, the pension negotiations will continue.
Labour organizations have stirred up a dispute over linking the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a work solution by autumn, but according to the most recent estimate, it will be made during this week.
The Prayer.
Rovaniemi women’s volleyball league team Woman Volley stumbled against the league rider Vampula Athletes in the final of the Pihtopouta training tournament on Sunday.
The Vampura won the five-part match 3-2 victory.
The last set was lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and in the pass, Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's six was so stunned that the 190-centimeter American trainer Jennifer Keddy was stuck in the back on the side.
He was played by Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyllönen was playable despite her thumb injury and formed with Johanna Pekkarinen WoVo’s most flammable combination.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzem for the last 1.5 sets.
The best part of the vampire was the skilled Russian passport and the libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo visited as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna HPK arrives at the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The two teams will face the dealer on Saturday at 18 a.m. in an official training game.
On Sunday we will meet again at the school.
Lidl raises high figures in Finland
During the financial year ended at the end of February, the turnover of the company’s Finnish stores increased by almost 25 percent to almost 1.2 billion euros.
The company released its earnings figures on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland and plans to continue its expansion.
Lidl also said it paid 14 million euros in taxes to Finland for the past financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovary cancer deaths are more common in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video to pay tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers looked at the patient data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Chief researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs Could Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers looked at women’s health history over a seven-year period.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, past illnesses and socioeconomic status also influenced her chances of survival.
In older women and with a wider spread of cancer at the time of diagnosis, the chances of survival were the lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible causes.
“Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities,” Jordan says.
While remote treatments are becoming more prevalent and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also proposes increased mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old family mother living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the rooftop park activity in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the Hotel Pohjanhov.
The City Council decided on Monday that the proposed station plan for the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be made publicly visible at the service point in Oswita.
Opinions on the draft plan are requested from the Environmental Commission and the Lapin ely-center.
Through the change in the station schedule, the city wants to enable the continuation of motorcycling activities related to tourism in the area.
The site is intended to form a park area, which includes the area between the current Friendship Park and it and the river.
During the period from 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 motorcycles will be permanently available.
It is also permitted to place tanking stations in a specified area.
The new park area will also be allowed for maintenance transportation.
The city of Rovaniemi has leased the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for motorcycling use during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in the spring of 2014 and is valid until the spring of 2018.
The planned construction and construction has also raised a lot of opposition.
Inhabitants of neighboring buildings have been upset by the vote and worried about emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been investigated and no observations exceeding the indicative values have been made.
The new equipment is less emission-efficient.
Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further, hotel safari customers should be transported to the safari departure points by buses, which would be an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding area of the Friendship Park are also wide enough for the rails, better than the places presented as replacement starting points, such as the eastern side of the Ounasjoen bridges.
The location of the Friendship Park is good, so that in the future the activities can be expanded, for example, to the area of Ounaspaviljong.
The establishment of parking activities is part of the city strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the goal of the city is to create a good framework for business activities by reserving sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous places.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for motorcycling in the central part plan, which has not yet gained legal force.
The decline in property ownership is visible in garden shops
A decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in the group of under 35, could lead to a decrease in the turnover of gardening stores by tens of millions as today’s young consumers reach the “main target group” of gardening sales for their age.
According to a report by the Financial Times, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the money homeowners spend on gardening.
The study also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens.In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the courtyard is increasingly covered as a parking spot. These factors also threaten the garden area, with an estimated value of around £5 billion a year.
In the larger area of London, home ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, and there is the least money per household spent on gardening products in the whole country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), increasing the rental of houses or reducing the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s chief garden counselor, says, “For example, plants grown in portable cultivation vessels are popular with homeowners because such cultivation vessels can be included when needed.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997–2005 were a thriving period for the resale of the gardening industry, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will boost this year due to better weather conditions, worse than in March and April last year.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat over spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country’s most experienced U.S. diplomat to submit a report on the spying of Americans and British in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. embassy manager and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have that documents leaked by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main target of US and British intelligence intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major nations have spied on each other.
A previous report about the German main intelligence agency’s spying on Ankara has sparked a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, has been attached to the female protagonist in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the movie Two Nights in the Morning, which will start filming this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her role in the 2003 film The Invasion of the Barbars.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film The Butterfly Glass Picture.
Two Nights in the Morning is a movie.
The film premieres in Finland in September 2015.
Mallorcan police chief Magaluf accused of corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and municipal government officials in Calvià at the Mallorcan Attorney General’s Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested for a wet celebration following allegations of corruption by business and bar owners in the famous Magaluf area.
Commissioner-in-Chief José Antonio Navarro was arrested after several business owners on Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, those who revealed the case presented evidence of blackmail by police and municipal government officials in Calvià at the Office of the Mallorcan Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with allegations of corruption and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC that nightclub owners were angry at the government’s bias that significantly complicated their business.
“It’s not about money anymore, it’s about survival,” one business owner told the court.
You will not destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was on the headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video spread where an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
The island authorities have since tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behavior of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the infamous, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the video was filmed, was ordered to close for a year, and the nightclub owner and pub crawler Carnegie were jointly ordered to pay a fine of €55,000.
Magaluf, a popular tourist destination among young British tourists, has also become popular with the so-called “balconing” trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from the balcony to the balcony or the balcony to the hotel’s pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters when rockets and grenade-throwers bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the region recovered from fighting.
The opening of the schools caused joy and excitement in the missile-bombed communities of southern Israel, but the traces of the battles are still visible.
In the Pashosh kindergarten in the southern city of Ashdod, workers removed the traces of fragments from the walls and slides before children arrived after a rocket hit the kindergarten.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area need painful routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said the return to school would be “a little strange.”
“We’ve had difficult times when we didn’t leave home anywhere,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the ceasefire began last week, thousands of residents of communities like Saad had stayed inside or left their homes to safer areas beyond Gaza to escape the fires of rockets and grenades.
Many inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are suspicious about the return of a Palestinian grenade killed by a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, about ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border, which was the target of a heavy Palestinian shooting.
He encouraged children to study diligently and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it failed to resolve many key issues, such as Hamas’ demands to lift the Israeli and Egyptian blockade and reopen Gaza’s air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month.
The UN and Palestine estimates that more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed about the number of dead, saying at least half of those killed were soldiers, although it has no solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to over 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelter and fighting continuing, school authorities postponed the start of the school last week.
“I hope that the school will soon open and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old who lives in shelter at a school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used meter, housing prices have risen the highest in seven years in the winter months in Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, increased by 1.1 percent in August, RP data showed on Monday.
As a result of the increase, prices increased by 4.2% in June, July and August, more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as much as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not increased steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price hike.
RP Data results show that housing prices rose 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin are the next most vibrant with an average price rise of five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose only 1.4 percent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
Lawless says the spring that has begun in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the rise in auction housing sales, a generally lively sales momentum and a continuing low interest rate, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted a record audience
A new museum and art has attracted a record number of visitors this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors had visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has exhibited classical pop art works by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mäntä billing artsweiken said on Monday it had set a visiting record, when 14,500 people had visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
These numbers are not used to.
The crowd has struck through the doors and windows,” says director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will approach 100,000.
In the previous years, there were about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
The museum director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
Hopefully the art season will continue over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened in the museum.
Police are investigating four robberies in the past few days.
On Sunday night, a man broke into a building by breaking a window.
The man had taken a small amount of money from the box.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel was stolen from a truck tank.
From the Petäisenniska port, the boat with its rear engines was taken between Sunday and Monday.
The fishing boat was marked by the fish outwardly bright and inwardly glowing.
Inside it was written “Oiva”.
Two suspects were arrested by the police.
On Sunday night, a robbery took place in a commercial property.
A police dog got a trace and a two-year-old man was found hiding under a shell in the woods.
On Monday, police arrested another man who is suspected of committing the same crime.
Missing Amphetamine Caused Murder Accusation in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amfetamines led to the murder of a man born in 1977 in Kajaan.
According to the prosecutor, the man had entered the apartment with his spouse and another man and shot a 34-year-old woman from Kajaan, the owner of the apartment he suspected was a drug exporter.
The accused denied the accusation and claimed that another man was the shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when a police guard stopped a passenger car in which the company was burning clothes used in blood labor.
In addition to the burned garments, a broken gun was found in the car.
The district court will give a verdict later on.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Department of Meteorology, the same warm August occurs on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Department of Meteorology show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Por, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-child Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently training for the Rudy’s Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap in upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother's death, and she reflects a lot on her relationship with her father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, “Stop grumbling.”
Leave your sister in peace.
Go on!
I look at cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already grown up when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer lesson or the beauty of cricketing.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was for me the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal welding factory in Dudley and thus gained an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, even though working conditions are better now than at the time.
The melting tanks are now slightly brighter, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths where flames, smoke, and dirt erupt and remind you of the desert.
His father used to go to the bath and just lay in the bath, and slowly he started singing for himself as he washed the dirt of the meltdown away from himself.
As I walked around the meltdown, I realized that she had been doing that job for years to get us food on the table, and I started appreciating her more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked the intimacy offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother began to get sick shortly before she died that we began to repeat to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she lacked from herself as a child.
Do you have to repeat “I love you”?
Stop that hustle now!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why not be friends?
She is a great mother
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the causes of my mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do a full translation.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s well-known, short beard may depict his change in career development.
Having received a lot of positive feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he has immersed himself in the making of theatre.
Next in turn were The Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences ("The Fencing").
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started working in the factory when he was only 16 years old.
A coach noticed him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry began his television career in the mid-1970s. “For a long time I was the only black imitator and comedian on television,” he says.
Henry learned to work.
I had to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn to produce jokes from the sliding belt between 1975 and 1985, while I lived in the abyss and was on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny at the New Faces talent contest in 1975
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a lightweight entertainment show where people performed in black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family did not like it.
I wish I had never participated, but I do not regret it.
Even though my position was weird and disgusting, I got to work on huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Nevertheless, “the British television’s award-winning, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program” was at the same time “an orphan parody of black people.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked on another comedy series that both joked and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry became known for his character as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
The following decade Henry spent on ads, documentaries, TV series, and film plays, but after his 2008 BBC LennyHenry.tv show, he said to himself, “What are you going next, Len – now it looks like you’re just on your seat or on sidewalks.”
Next was Radio 4’s documentary series “What’s So Great About...?”.
The first part is about Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn’t really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears socks and has money.
That’s why Shakespeare’s theme aroused fear in me.
Everyone we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try.
Don’t give up the whole idea until you know what you’re talking about.
Meet the words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry spoke 20 sentences of Othello’s last speech for a documentary and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me had missed before, and now it was put in place.
“That’s what it’s about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was performed.
The show was ultimately a success.
It was expected to fail, but it did not happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the main role in the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I played in the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t really believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once there were technical problems with the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You’ll have to do it for 10 minutes alone until the computer starts again.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem has been fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me whispered relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
“You’re part of the show, stay in your role.”
Henry "Fences" in the Duchess Theatre
Learning the words for the “Fences” show was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods, “This is what you have to do.”
Henry said this with a loud voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love the training rooms.
Henry, however, is still essentially a comedian: small humorous boys are constantly interrupting our conversations as he switches from imitation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comics is a matter of will, as getting immediate praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you are constantly thirsty for it, it can lead to a deadlock.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like, but generally it doesn’t inspire me the same way it did before.
I ask Henry if he plans to go on a new stand-up tour.
It brings me a real pleasure to sit alongside the instructor who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I want to ever give up that feeling.
Is this his rebirth?
I think so.
I like to play –
It is really fun.
There is always a story in the show, and I like it.
I love the stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Launches Register of Officials to Remove “Spirit Workers”
Kenya has begun creating a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove “ghost workers” from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still be paid salaries after they leave their office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to end corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, at least $1 million per month was spent on salaries and other financial abuses of “ghost workers.”
The government suspects that salaries are being paid to the account even after a person has died or left the office, BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri in the capital Nairobi.
All officials will be required to register in the identification centers in the coming weeks to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration format, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a proper reason will be removed from the salary list.
“This measure will significantly rationalize the public sector as it defines how many people actually work in their positions. Moreover, it will clear the payrolls at both levels of government. This will solve the problem of ‘spirit workers’,” says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official in the Ministry responsible for decentralization and planning.
The result of Seinäjoen’s 2015 financial year could remain a deficit of EUR 25,5 million unless the city adjusts its activities and expenditure developments in the tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual deficit is about 9.4 million.
As possible means of efficiency were the reduction of the scope and level of services and the purchase of services, the sale of assets and subsidies, and the increase of tax and payment revenues.
The target of the 10 million euro investment is 8.5 million.
There is no relief to the municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and a 5% cut in state shares further undermine the outlook.
The aim of the seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Council has agreed that savings should be made.
The ship must be turned to the target in line with the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Council.
The City Council has submitted the proposals to the Board of Directors.
The proposals of the City Council will be the basis for the budget preparation at the plenary economic seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the plenary session, the draft budget will be forwarded to the city council and the city council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of plotting against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “anti-government plots,” local media sources said.
The police did not immediately comment.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations in December last year that targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large criminal gang and monitoring phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said the police's actions were part of the planned actions of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
All children do not go back to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told awaiting journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he is committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who serves as a senior teacher at Slaviansk school, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter attends, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children can learn something that will be useful to them in the future.
Traditionally, the celebrations of the first day of school include children’s stamped shirts, ballooning and giving flowers to teachers.
Perry of Texas says insulting tweet was unauthorized
Texas Governor Rick Perry's confirmed Twitter account posted an insulting picture of a Democratic district attorney while hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by a new tweet in which Perry vowed that he had nothing to do with the image.
This tweet was sent from my account.
“I disapprove of the tweet and have deleted it,” a subsequent post said.
Perry’s backbone forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s verified Twitter account, it’s unclear who posted the picture.
The first tweet contained a blasphemous picture of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg’s funding post after he refused to resign, leading to a large jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry being charged.
The title of the tweet was: “I don’t always drive drunk, with three times the permissible percentage... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing his finger.”
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg’s agency did not lead the grand jury’s investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and has called the charges a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge to reject the charges, saying the law under which Texas’s longest serving governor is charged is unclear in the face of the constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the state public integrity unit operating in Travis County and handling public sector charges after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision prompted a left-wing monitoring group to file a formal appeal on the matter.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place in the Iowa Conference during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry promised to end the match by posting on Twitter a picture of himself running on a lake with the text “Here we come, South Carolina!”
Berkeley says housing markets are back “normal”
One of London’s most important builders has warned that the housing market in Southeast England has “returned” to normal activity levels.
Housing in the capital London has been plagued by enormous demand and a sharp price hike while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley, said Monday that “since the start of this fiscal year, the markets and the number of transactions have returned to normal after the 2013 peak,” adding that this has enabled a “stable operating environment.”
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to data from the Land Registry, housing prices in the city increased by 18.5% in the previous year alone, significantly exceeding the average in England and Wales, which was 6.7%.
The average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings at Berkeley rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching a £423,000 price hike by the end of April.
However, the stronger pound has made London’s real estate a less attractive destination in recent months – some of the interest has also been influenced by the new property tax laws and political rhetoric of a possible “cottage tax” ahead of May’s general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which tighter lending regulations, would lead to lower levels of market growth in both property sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the amount of approved loans fell in July, indicating a cooling housing market.
Property broker Hamptons International has lowered its forecast for 2015 for London’s property prices, saying prices will fall by three percent because the index that measures the opinion of homeowners about prices has already begun to weaken.
The number of transactions made in London’s most expensive districts of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter a year ago, real estate agent WA Ellis says.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who increased revenue from sold properties to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, right type of product at the best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained vibrant.”
In June, the company said it sold 3,742 new homes in the pre-April year, which is almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% from a year ago to £380 million and revenue increased by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said on Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s annual earnings are in line with market expectations.
Analysts agree that the entire year's pre-tax profit is £450 million.
The Berkeley stock sold at the London Stock Exchange for £23.96.
Hackers leaked naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
The hacker, who claims to have hundreds of other stars, has leaked photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker for “grim breach of privacy.”
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The images, originally posted on the 4chan photo post page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple’s iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other stars targeted by hacking allegedly includes dozens of other women such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how much of the images are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim v World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
“For those of you who are watching the pictures that my husband and I have taken years ago in private: I hope you are in good spirit,” Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon’s “iCarly” and “Victorious” series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that “these so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, don’t you understand?”
Let me finish this from the beginning.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images about the star.
Just for us is an excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s praised new novel about love and the j-letter
They dissolved, it best depicted what had happened, gradually they separated from each other like a carton box left out in the rain.
Only from time to time he heard from the woman that she was too serious, troubled, intense, disconnected, and maybe also a little spicy.
Then he shrugged his hand.
He recognised the speck.
He was thick, like a silk.
The last victim of his spike was an initial relationship, which, however, had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have relieved his lonely boredom, and it might even have brought some content to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untouched hair, and she was a delicate and gentle beauty with a joyful heart, from a village in the north that was even harsher and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with an older travel partner, who Kevern assumed was his aunt. His aunt had inherited a house in a wet but paradise valley, and the valley was properly named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in every bathroom, the ducks had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place for their own, weeds grew in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children’s fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” was nominated for the Booker Prize in 2014.
Nominations will be announced next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the midst of a long hail, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening dispersely to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and reassuring news, as Ailinn's crossed, sun-brushed legs brought Kevern to mind a song that had been sung by a long-forgotten black performer and which his father had frequently listened to underneath the huts of the cabin.
Your foot is too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned – nothing was actually banned – they were just not played anymore.
They were forgotten, just like the word forgotten.
The public opinion produced what was not achieved by laws and statements: just as in literature people chose to read memories of heroes, cookbooks and romance, so in music they prefer ballads.
When the day was wild, Kevern started tapping a fictional piano and singing a serenade to Ailin's big legs with a rough comic voice.
Ailinn did not understand.
“It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller,” Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter “j” escaped from his lips.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let out a word that starts with j and you didn’t remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you’d have to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game then, and it wasn’t now.
He knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard anything like that.
Jazz was not banned, it was not played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for a single word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The wisdom was the same.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was a musical excellence.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn’t have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin’s age, it was likely that she didn’t remember a time when popular singers weren’t black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
A obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted as grateful — grateful, for being as if saved by a trade of happiness — the principle that each group did the things inherent to it.
Based on their temperament and physical qualities, people with African-Caribbean roots were best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were naturally talented with electrical devices, so their task was to ensure that every family had a functional phone used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke plates.
When THAT Happened Happened, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled smoothly for fear of being accused of the flames, and for fear that the flames would hit them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning waterpipes, and continued to live their lives with their eyes shaken to the ground and depressed by boredom.
Let each act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sung could ever have been dressed up as music.
Love is expressed through music.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for the grandparents.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of the giant cabbage head plants.
Ailinn did not understand.
Why did your father love something like this?
He was going to say that the whole thing was a joke, but he didn’t want to raise two fingers on his lips with Ailin.
Ailinn thought of her as strange now.
“My dad thought it was fun,” he said instead.
Ailinn shrugged her head unbelieving, and her hair covered Kevern’s field of sight.
There is nothing else to see in the whole world except Ailinin’s enormous, varicose black hair.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
“If you say so,” he said, but didn’t sound convinced.
But it doesn’t explain why you’re singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not really big.
Maybe a little, maybe a little...
And you hate me because my ankle is too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I do not hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
She could have said, “I love you,” but it was too early to do so.
“I think you’re charming because of your thick ankles,” he tried to fix the situation.
I am distracted in that sense.
This was no help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the impact was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the compelling charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father was meant to be cruel.
Per he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and stood up from his terrace chair, throwing out the receiver and splashing the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only of backflower, so he could not use it as the cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
“And your thick head is what distortedly attracts me to you,” he said.
Except that I don’t feel so.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did he think he would hit him?
He had never told Kevern about life in the rugged northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that in essence it had been the same as life here.
The same enormous, thin sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even more pale and evil than their smugglers and scatterers, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or harass them.
A thick head?
He would still see a thick fist if he wasn’t careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word for the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern also thought that was too much, because the suction itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomon’s body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace seat like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s sorrow surprised him.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
Ailinn followed her walk—just as her companion watched Kevern go through the upper window—the man who was the cause of her hard life.
Adam was leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike him.
A backward, bowing, shameful, beaten man who had lost all desire to fight—why did he feel that the sight was so familiar to him, though he had never remembered to have seen such things before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the just-recorded event, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private public opinion measurement facility in Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continuation of low-to-moderate violence in areas of the country where it was most likely to decrease, or even cease, given the money and energy spent to eradicate it.
“Many things have already been accomplished, and much remains to be done,” he wrote, “to compensate for the inherent aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most of them have won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the church towers that stretch across the bushes, human love has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people weep at sentimental ballads, flatter stories of defeats overcome, and swear in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty holds both rural communities and urban communities in its unwavering grip, and there is evidence of a new, more malignant attitude to argue in our homes, at our workplaces, on our streets, and even in play parks.
“You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize,” her director commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down at the ground.
Also, I have to ask: are you an atheist?
“I believe I don’t have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
The feminist?
Still silence again.
“I don’t ask,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I oppose atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are the servants of a prejudiceless society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity is entirely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call innate energy and physical strength.
Hoking about what happened, if happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it ever happened, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, a flamingo pink LED light proclaimed the guidance that Ofnow had distributed to the country for a quarter of the last century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, and singing is better than writing, but nothing overcomes love.
“I understand very well what you mean,” Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, being sure that his director had stopped, “and I just want to say that we are not healed as effectively as we imagine ourselves to be.
I’m concerned that if we aren’t warned, we’ll find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAS Happened if Happened.
This time, however, we will not pour out our hatred and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “to describe as ‘mistakes’ the actions that our grandparents may have done or not done.
You’re also going too far by saying that they’ve poured out ‘their hatred and mistrust on others’.”
Those in a position like you shouldn’t have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we’re not talking about “us” or “them.”
There was no “us” or “other”.
It was a time of chaos, that’s all we know about it.
“If we are quite honest, in that chaos,” Esme dared to continue, “no group in society can say that they have behaved well.
I am not blaming anyone.
What was done, was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to say more about this, we agree with you.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But what is the purpose of the past if we don’t learn from it?
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing,
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
“I’m going to review your report,” he said, expressing that Esmen was time to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was struck by a pedestrian motorcyclist, whose driving was described by passers as “malignant and furious.”
Coincidence is happening.
Lesotho Army Denies Planned Attack, Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho have denied having plotted an attack aimed at overthrowing the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the military had besieged his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state travelled to neighboring South Africa with his family after saying he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said the army responded to a threat from “political fanatics”.
“The Lesotho Armed Forces took action after receiving a series of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are prepared to cause trouble,” he told Voice of America.
South African Prime Minister Clayson Monyela said the military's actions appeared to be a revolutionary attempt.
“Al none has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces appear in all respects to correspond to the characteristics of a revolutionary attempt,” he says.
According to military officials in Lesotho, the soldiers will return to their casinos on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government while Thabaine is absent.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
There has been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements in the big coalition government.
He denies that he undermined the government’s power, even though otherwise claimed.
Microsoft to set up a new data center
Information technology company Microsoft has established a large data center in New Zealand, the location of which the company does not agree to specify.
In a statement, Microsoft said it did not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, it is now fully equipped and connected to the network.
It’s an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the place of the center was previously named Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft is shutting down its Oulu headquarters, taking over 500 jobs.
Microsoft has announced that it will cut up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, chief communications officer at Microsoft, told STT that the company would not comment on how many people the new data center will employ.
About the creation of the data center in New Zealand on Monday the Handelsblatt.
Man accused of overtaking girl in traffic
A 78-year-old man is accused of attacking a three-year-old girl in a traffic intersection at the FIFE.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, East Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car inadvertently and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges against Dundee at the sheriff’s hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to take place in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
In fact, I took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are waterproof.
Additionally, set the camera’s shooting settings to match the photos or videos you are taking.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a setup to optimize shooting conditions underwater.
In addition – before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can withstand only 5 feet depth, others up to 50-60 feet depth.
Discover both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to summarize the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and imaging can either succeed or fail.
Take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for scratching, which means taking multiple photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is reduced significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or ocean.
This will also add more colors to your images; the deeper you go, the fewer colors will appear.
Try to get close to the object.
This is an important advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater because the lighting conditions are poor.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object in order for the object to fill the whole picture up to the frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to elect its leaders, protesters vow vengeance
China's parliament on Sunday ruled that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 elections despite growing unrest demanding democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district after activists began planning and implementing protests just hours after the decision was announced.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communists practically the power to remove any candidate who does not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it’s still outrageous,” said Democratic Party chairwoman, lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the French.
It is clear that we are working with an autonomous government.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that a general candidacy for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK surrendered Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017.
Chinese leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it allowed Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through a nomination committee managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be accepted.
In the summer before the decision, some of the largest and most remarkable protests in the region in years took place in Hong Kong.
Occupy Central with Love and Peace, which has threatened to block the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal voting rights.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was released, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s main government buildings.
During the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of non-civilization and they would create a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose the details apparently afraid that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published online, the organizers said the movement “considers Occupy Central as a last resort, which will only be implemented if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way.”
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has been wasted and the conquest of the center will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday, security measures were strict near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
The unrest in Hong Kong is fuelled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of people coming from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there are fears that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s livelihood – the business world.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it will last,” said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don’t want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from our grip.
Such an idea would be bad for investing.
China’s state media has also revealed stories that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the worshippers of the Western powers that sparked the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, attending 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region.
U.S. prom tradition hits British universities: private jets for new students
We enthusiastically respond to the demand by establishing Britain’s first luxury class travel mode for today’s students.
In addition to a private plane, the company also offers other vehicles such as a Rolls-Royce Phantom, an Aston Martin or a McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable admission to the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise roam their property in cars loaded across the country to the extreme.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP Friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the easiest and highest-quality transport to the university.
The company’s spokesman said there were no reservations yet because the service has just been established, but added that “students will start making orders in the coming weeks.”
The company believes there is demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 in annual tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different in terms of their expectations and desires than those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticizes the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization’s Department of Higher Education, “this service plan seems to be really far from the lives of the majority of students.”
Many who start their studies this month are shocked by the level of cost of living, as the financial support offered in the form of loans and scholarships has been left behind by the tremendous rise in basic cost of living.
Ipswich’s pig house for sale
Property agents removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk after finding a big pig lying in the house’s living room.
The one-bedroom house, priced at £120,000, is located along a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned his head on the couch.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner’s pet.
“The picture, however, came to the announcement by accident and has since been removed,” the company’s spokesman said.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as “a unique one-bedroom house.”
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has aroused interest on social media, where it has been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to sink to the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of the Finnish victory.
He was able to forget his blatant U.S. match and swept the blood of Ukraine in the second half with his standing decisions.
But Salin transferred all his glory to the Susifans - and did it in style:
I was supposed to get out there at the end, the encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, nothing could be done.
That black and white was almost too much for me.
Salini’s momentum included nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball shakes, plates and temples everywhere that happened.
I don’t know how it happened, but I got into such a flow state that everything went well.
They come from somewhere, now in an insane place, Sasu shook.
That is my role.
Doing all that.
It was great to see that the others got caught.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the pleasant player and spirit creator of the team, so it’s no wonder that his example raised the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big and tough Ukrainian fifth.
Finland at the World Cup after a 32-year break: The previous was a tough judge game
Heikki Montonen was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men’s volleyball team played at the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a fiery match against France in the beginning.
“In the final balls of that match, the referee’s game was crazy,” Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled in the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the mess was even more confusing," Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the world’s winners, with the Polish World Cup starting on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in the international airball over the course of 32 years.
The strengths of the players are roughly the same class as before, but the quality and skill are now more.
The average size of the players has also increased.
“The game is getting faster,” he thought.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I am hoping that Finland will continue in the first place.
Then it can become harsh,” Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Circus
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a win-win match against Tunisia.
The current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Hopefully we will be in 17th place.
“South Korea and Tunisia should go down the road,” Parkkali said.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the Argentine national team.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö played in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening bathing at the Marines Church in Buenos Aires were part of the national team's program at the World Cup in 1982.
Kalin ran out with his teammates.

The finalists will be playing the songs of the competition.
There will always be good memories of the competition, says Immonen.
Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog fell into distress in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog who was with him in the mountains on Thursday injured his heel.
The wounded dog could no longer walk on the steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I failed, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it a little further, but its legs just didn’t carry it,” Mikkelsen writes in her update.
Mikkelsen said there was no help from the police, the nearby hotel or passers.
At night, the situation was already threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Norway’s highest mountain at Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help her with the dog, Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon, a German man arrived with a boat.
From the mattress to Cital, pairs of pairs were obtained, to which the injured dog was attached.
A German man came a moment after us when we had thought what to do with the dog and carried the dog on our knees down the slope for a moment, Soini says.
Photo by Soini
The dog was carried down by a carrier.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but in a difficult terrain the carrying progressed slowly.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happy to come down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen searched for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank them once again.
He was arrested on Sunday, but the Germans are still unaccompanied.
I don’t know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn’t helped me, we’t have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I haven’t thanked them enough.
They don’t know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, they were already on their way home.
They had received pleasant hearings from Mikkelsen: - Cita says it can be better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
A British woman for years feared death due to a wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth she had only a few years of life left because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT). It means a set of inherited diseases that damage the outer nerves of the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor skills, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and thinness in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, meaning the symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he was 18, and would die before he was 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two children says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it lasted longer than everyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was harassed in school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was submitted to several acyclovir surgeries to straighten his legs. As part of the surgeries, after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers stating that he suffered from FA disease.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA,” she says.
When I got the news from them, I was shocked and in a state of panic.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of eighteen, and I would die before the age of twenty-five, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my ability to function.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, she found that her walking was not worsening as much as she had thought and asked her doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “Girl gold, I don’t think you have this disease, because otherwise you would already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you are suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was postponed,” she says.
Charity CMT UK organizes the CMT month to draw attention to illness.
Hundreds of migrants found in coal truck in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants in a train carrying coal, the Macedonian interior ministry said on Monday.
The victims were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late on Sunday in Veles in Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn’t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and an additional 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
Several million illegal immigrants are travelling through Macedonia to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled the Syrian civil war.
The Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto's third reactor will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has submitted an updated timetable for Olkiluoto 3 to Industry Force TVO.

Nastola donated to Bottas 1.4 acres of beach land - worth about 60,000 euros
The Nastola Municipal Government donated Valtteri Bottas a 1.4 hectare beach plot on the Kärkjärvi beach from Villahte.
The municipal government demonstrated fairness in sport and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no sound of rhetoric at the meeting when the plot was decided, says municipal director Pauli Syyrakki.
The Bottas gift plot has farm buildings - a total of seven pieces.
This year, except for one, they will be removed.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the plot within two years.
We are pleased that he has his birthplace and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has visited the primary school every year to tell about his sporting career and life.
Hopefully it will continue, the president said.
The municipal manager estimates the value of the beach plot to be 40000-60000 euros.
The beach is low and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
With variable success over the decades, Nastola hasined success in the sport with the help of gift grounds in the municipality.
Aki Parviainen, world champion in bowling, and Tuuli Matinsalo, world champion in aerobic, received self-driving tones from the municipality and built a luxurious self-driving house.
However, they did not stay in Nastola, but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola for work and then moved to another place after the life situation changed.
Bottas is a Nostolian native and his situation is different, Syyrakki inches and believes Bottas will stay in his hometown.
Hull washed the attacker with a record amount for the club of Hernandez
Hull has invested a record sum in the acquisition of Uruguayan national team player Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will be replaced by the Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million ($12 million).
The contract is three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won the Serie B and entered the Italian Premier League.
With the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In the World Cup last summer, Hernandez came to the field in two games of change.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time,” said Hull coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also announced that he has bought Senegal's national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russia's Space Test Failed - Gets Sent to Sex Travel Died
Five small geeks sent into space have died, the Russian space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The Gekos travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than one and a half months.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
The experiment involved one male and four females.
Although the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of eggs, for example.
Through the effects on geeks, it can be tried to predict what effects the lack of gravity would have on a person if he stayed in a similar state for longer periods, illustrated New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the date of death and the cause or causes of death are being established.
According to the Interfax news agency, passengers crucified as “sex gays” were frozen.
It is also surprising that the fruit frogs who travelled on the same Foton-M4 survived the journey without difficulty, and also had a post-growth.
French suspect arrested at Nice airport
A suspect was arrested at the French airport in Nice on Saturday.
The 22-year-old is suspected of recruiting a jihadist group in Syria.
This was announced by French authorities on Sunday.
Authorities found the man after he had tempted a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
She was scheduled to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, but he currently lives in France.
French intelligence officials have been monitoring the man’s actions.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalized youths attracted to wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk for France as well.
Officials estimate that some 800 French citizens or those registered in France have travelled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave for Syria during the last conflict.
We have good chances of winning.
The hopes of the country basketball team for the next place are at stake, as Finland will face Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup today.
If an opening loss for the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary gains to the next place.
“Ukraine is a good team, but I think we have a good chance of winning,” Petteri Koponen said.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic in their first match 72–62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player of Ukraine is the game manager Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the world champion of 100 meters three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter is a quick guy, but yes we have played against them before and we have to get our norm defenses in order, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland will play better than in yesterday’s defeat to the United States.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal wolf flock on the field, Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged photos spread on the internet, some confirmed to be true
There are a number of nude images on the internet that are alleged to be portraying famous public figures.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a “background” campaign.
Entertainment site TMZ has released an angry comment from Lawrence’s representatives that appears to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, officials threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her are authentic.
She had taken those photos years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what terrible trouble was seen for this.
“I feel my sympathy for everyone who was the victim of hacking,” he wrote.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice claims the images of her own name are fake.
There are also real or fake nude photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka's goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They're not doing enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the last place in the Veikkausliga.
The comments of goalkeeper Walter Viitala after Sunday’s VPS match well describe the club’s confusing current situation.
I have not had a goalkeeper for four months.
But we have to adapt to everything,” Viitala said after the 1-2 defeat.
He made a lot of defensive mistakes, especially in the first half.
The goalkeeper was not happy with a bad defense.
The player traffic in Hong Kong has been busy this summer, and therefore the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a tight pace.
With roulette, many young players also have opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some do not work hard enough to get out of here someday," Viitala said without naming any individual player.
Hong’s head coach, Shefki Kuqi, agreed to some extent with Viitala.
“I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and think you’re a betting league player and don’t have to work, then you’re probably in the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I have given a lot of time to young people.
If they don’t want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it’s not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players can’t expect immediate success when the players are constantly changing.
There has not been the same combination twice in a row.
Especially in the defence sector.
That’s the biggest reason we’re in this position,” Kuqi said.
After the VPS defeat, Honka is the serial bomber, with TPS being second in equal points.
There are still seven rounds left, so the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to 1st.
I’ve never dropped a team, and I’m not going to.
We will definitely not drop out of this series,” the goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier to make TV series after decades of break
Lars von Trier is returning as a TV director.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The film was produced by Louise Vesth at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to Zentropa, filming of the series should begin in 2016.
Trier will be working on a series of screenwriting from this autumn.
The series is English.
The mysterious project is also by Trier’s long-time partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his hard sales talks.
According to him, such a series “has never been seen and will never be seen.”
“Hold your breath,” Aalbæk Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s he directed a television series.
01.09.2014 15:20 Trading chain Lidl seems to have gotten the Finns on its side, at least if you can believe in the earnings figures.
The turnover of the Finnish trading group Lidl Finland Kommandiittiyhtiö continued to grow in the financial year ended at the end of February.
The company also increased its profit.
The earnings before taxes rose to EUR 79.6 million, compared to EUR 56.4 million a year earlier.
The turnover increased from 960 million euros to 1.2 billion euros.
The growth was 25 percent.
The company also increased its market share and improved its operating profit from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The profit rate was 7.1.
The accounting period of the German-owned Lidl runs from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company said it paid 13.7 million euros in taxes to Finland for the financial year ending in February.
The company, which has continuously expanded its store chain, has said it will invest 100 million euros in Finland this year.
Lidl has 142 stores in Finland and employs more than 4,000 people.
The first shops opened in 2002.
The Ice Bucket Challenge
The British Isabelle Roberts cried so loudly when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the skeleton of her face.
The Ice Bucket Challenge ended badly.
A woman has been taken to treatment after she screamed as she performed the Ice Bucket challenge so loudly that her jaw fell out of place.
Isabelle Roberts cried so loudly when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I just screamed, but as I screamed, I felt my cheek started to stiffen,” she told The Mirror.
Iceberg is 20 years old.
Isabelle Roberts before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn’t, my cheek was locked, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and started laughing, but I had to get the first aid.
The 20-year-old British, who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.
The video capture has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The viewpoint of wolf outreach (also): How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
Today was a great feast.
This was what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played against France in the final tournament of the European Championship at the Marouss Hall in Athens.
No exaggeration of soft.
I remember the game when I was there.
The same was true of those about a hundred Finns who cried out in the empty hall of 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finland-Ukraine World Cup match?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times as many Finnish troops as one hundred.
The European Championship in 1995 was a crucial time for Finnish basketball.
The men paved their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian run-off match at the Helsinki Sports House.
This victory opened the doors to Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann brought Möttölä to the final tournament team.
A decision that many people disagree with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team sank deep.
At the Olympics in Athens, there were a little over a hundred Finns.
Among them were journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there are many.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one can tell the exact number of Finnish tourists.
The estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever the number is, it is an incomprehensible number.
Here is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global economy, move across borders.
We still have an opportunity to see how we are going internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys are succeeding around the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, professor of physical sociology.
Sure, both in Spain and in the World Cup in airball in Poland, there are Finns who are looking for experience.
The joint experience.
But it does not explain everything.
The sport itself has to be attractive.
It makes sports a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to go to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses cannot move.
Let’s go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and the players to throw themselves into the top sport professionally.
Nearly 10 years went by.
Then the direction changed and the national team business was raised to the ground.
The aircraft had taken the same action a little earlier.
Both are enjoying the fruit of their work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their high-end sport in which the sacred Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public is also interested.
And the media has taught what such a carnival support is, Itkonen reminds.
Can the football arts transfer this massive interest to domestic series as well?
On average, basketball is played for hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
It is a good question, not necessarily an answer that promises good for the species.
The other school believes that interest is shifting.

Assurance for the plot of Bottas - almost 1.5 acres from the lake shore
Nastola rewards Formula Driver Valtteri Bottakse at the beachfront.
The municipal government unanimously approved the surrender of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, there will be a holiday home.
The success of Bottas has been tracked in Nastola since the time of this karting.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift estate is located in Koiskala, on Kärkjärvi beach.
It has become the property of Nastola Municipality as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven demolished buildings in the area, of which the municipality will demolish six by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth Formula 1 prize winner this year.
He is fifth in the MM.
Bottas is a Nostolian native and lived his childhood in Villahte.
He now lives in England, but travels to Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth camps.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It is currently demonstrating and testing them at the ongoing U.S. Open in New York.
The testers of Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are the field players, but the amateur Marcus Giron, who is among the top university players, also likes it.
According to him, the shirt helps him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nail shirts have silver-woven sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the mould on the shirt and from there on to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The central mould is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not revealed the exact time the shirt will start selling, nor has it even suggested its price, Tech Times.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
California-based Athos has brought smart shirts and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars per piece and the central unit of the thumb size required for them costs two hundred dollars.

A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, soon beginning his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which later year students borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them forward immediately.
“My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for using it for a full semester and a bunch of sandwiches,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly ending up using e-commerce and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it significantly less than students who buy a book.
According to Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Industry statistics reveal that about a quarter of university bookstores last spring were rented books, says Trevor Meyer, chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
This is the easiest way to save money.
The networks
In online stores, you can get a new book for only one-third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostettler’s Calculus is almost $290, but at the specialty online bookstore Chegg.com the book is priced at $239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, a “Calculus” book can be purchased from Chegg.com for $93.49.
Brigham Young University last year student Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought a book entitled “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business” from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts’s Amherst College Without Walls School, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used on the course.
Sometimes reforms in the new edition are not essential for education.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc’s Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
rented
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and don’t need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% on the price of a new book.
For example, renting a “Calculus” book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Learn about the rental company’s rules, such as notes, the use and wear of the emphasis pen, and subsequent fees.
Renters, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
The e-books
Buying e-books instead of regular papers can also become a question.
Sometimes these books are rented and paid for the e-book access to its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc. bookstores.
In the Chegg store, you can get the “Calculus” book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because a number of classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It is important to compare different vendors regardless of which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon begins Pepperdine’s law school, recommends using a book ISBN number to figure out the price, as it can help make sure you’re looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he was eventually forced to purchase the book at full cost from the university bookstore.

Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year.
According to the Finnish Central Rescue Organization (Spek), 55 people have been killed in the fires so far.
At the same time last year, there were 31 deaths.
Most of the victims, 36, were men.
There are over 65 years old.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
Most fires occur in homes.
There have been 17 deaths in fire cases, 21 in private buildings and seven in row and other small buildings.
Spek reminds us about the fire safety of the home.
At least the functioning of all home fire alarms should be ensured.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial firefighters are easily deployable.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all spaces of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical devices they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the city center of Newport to march against NATO.
Around 150 people gathered in Cardiff City Hall on Sunday for the so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had even arrived from Belgium.
Children rescued from Australian Blue Mountains
Two teenagers were taken to safety after staying stuck overnight in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man walked after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap to Blackheath.
Families were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search team of local police and assistants was sent to search for the young people, and the twin was found around 23am near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
Police spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The passengers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian troops withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
The Ukrainian army has issued an order to withdraw.
According to Ukraine, the parachutists have been fighting with Russian tanks on the ground.
An army spokesman said the gunfire was so accurate that the gunmen were probably Russian soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
The Ukrainian patrol vessel, which was hit by artillery yesterday in the Sea of Azov in the southeast of Ukraine, sank this morning, the border guard said.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The police did not know which vessel was shot.
Separatists said on social media that they were shooting from the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Russia will not invade Ukraine.
Lavrov urged the Ukrainian army to immediately withdraw from positions from which it could not fire on civilians.
He said the Minsk talks between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should result in an immediate, unconditional ceasefire.
Lavrov also said that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains inundate Copenhagen and Malmö
The streets of Malmö and Copenhagen were flooded on Sunday as heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floods cut off several roads, confused traffic and buried cars alone.
Authorities estimated on Sunday that it could take time to calm the flood, although the rain was predicted to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains surprised the Swedish authorities and no weather warning was issued in advance.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, a journalist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rainfall that plagued the area was very local.
The rainfall area looks narrow and permanent in place.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French Socialists Should “Keep Silent and Help France,” Francois Hollande’s Leading Supporter Says
Valls urged the deeply divided left to “show their feelings” for the troubled socialist president, whose new government composition did not get the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our job is to stay with him,” Valls said and earned the applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister urged the government to leave peace despite France’s controversial 35-hour work week, despite a debate-inducing proposal from the new economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week that the rule should be eased.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, however, caused disagreement by appearing at a meeting of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing “France to give up hope for the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the continuing socialist disagreement and said she did not believe the new government will last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone out calling for war, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous didn’t even last for the summer.
“And the new government will not last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party’s proposal to dissolve the parliament and held certain his party’s election victory in early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a breakdown in the municipal elections in March and the far-right held the lead in the May European Parliament elections.
According to an opinion poll published on Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party could break up into several competing groups before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Po University political researcher Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist government manages to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to see quickly that change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation can get worse.
Pokka deceived Finnish runner Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkolan and meteorologist Pekka Pouda pokka badly deceived the program in the recorded part.
On Thursday, Huomenta Finland posted on its Facebook page a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, the conductors Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Huomenta Finland ad buff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go right.
Alm-Siira goes crazy in her words as she tries to pronounce the word budget rife, and her confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkolan to lose their pockets time after time.
And these heroes should be allowed to take a live broadcast tomorrow, it is stated in the Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the photo office, was ranked third in the series of portraits in 1972.
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
On the Fredrikstraße in Helsinki, in the House of Builders, the Socialist International meeting was held in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the toilet, seven bodyguards accompanied her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we were given about five minutes to film.
I took this picture 5 meters away.
The light and the background were in place.
I realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir’s appearance shows that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time in the past.
The competition was held with pictures of famous people or events.
It is great that today you can also succeed with other images, as long as there is an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best picture is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Olympics in Munich.
I did not send it to the competition.
The research has already cost more than 5 million euros.
The investigation into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki police drug unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 personal years.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his dissertation on information technology for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the supervision of the legality of police activities and the fight against crimes in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology makes it possible to multi-use criminal material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected for the purposes of investigating a crime is automatically an electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive legality control.
The examination will be held on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes are part of the vegetable diet"
The photo of a special message on the wall of the Women’s Journey school in Skopje caused food scattering on social media, Yle says on its website.
The vegetarian!
The school lunch includes fish and chicken meals.
Only when there is meat on the list, we will prepare a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old, forgotten message on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send angry feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, head of food and cleaning service, says that the note that was forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a while ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea, which has been discussed at the time with the health care department.
Every student gets a meal according to their wishes.
Today, in the schools of Pirkkala, students are offered a vegetarian diet option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or healthcare provider of a vegetarian diet.
Danger justifies the solution for Yli with the fact that the vegetarian food experiments of young people may leave the nutrition short and the lack of meat or chicken may arouse wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise to close $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to acquire its competitor, Prestige Cruises International Inc., for $3 billion.
With the deal, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would gain access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information about a possible agreement may be published this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not yield results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to disclose their names because negotiations did not take place in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments and the Apollo representative declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise operates from Miami and has 13 cruise ships covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, with a turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brands, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are competing to become the first choice for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issuance on the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since the 2007 transaction, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 by merging with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) as the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
Genting owns 28 percent of the company, Apollo owns 20 percent, and private equity investment firm TPG Capital LP owns 8 percent from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of the North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document issued by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of shares.
The city council is discussing the matter today.
Animalia hopes the city government will strongly support the initiative.
According to the Director of Animalia, Salla Tuomivaara, who prepares a dissertation for the University of Tampere, the delfinaries in Finland and around the world need to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread belief around the world that holding developed mammals like dolphins in dolphinaries is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
I would like this view to be applied to Tokyo as well.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to the court, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens the demands for the downturn of dolphin activity.
His death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi Dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to deaths, close the dolphin prison and begin to find out how the dolphins of Tampere could be transferred to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara demands.
See did not have time to experience a return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more life than their unmotivated concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia aims to prohibit the use of all species of wild animals in circuses in the preparation of the total reform of the Animal Protection Act.
This also includes dolphins.
To support this demand, Animalia’s Director-General Tuomivaara will take part in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins to be held today on September 1.
At the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki, a demonstration is taking a stand against the beginning of the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, around 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for use in dolphinariums or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday urged the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and to immediately start negotiations on the “state property” of the region, Russian news sources said.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled region of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin’s demand to the Kiev government to negotiate with the Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiators corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to in practice grant the newly declared Novorossiya independence, allowing it to be oriented to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with state television channel Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to recapture separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk areas, which separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimea peninsula itself on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently dubbed the region “Novorossija”, “New Russia” – this term reminds of the days of glory that preceded the revolution of the Russian superpower.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks are an “illusion” as long as Ukrainian politicians campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
“We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state in southeastern Ukraine.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to “state property” is linked to a broader independence that has been discussed for months with Kiev’s leadership as it tries to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions threatening their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov said.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s interim note, aimed at correcting the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s comments, emphasized that the Russian regime treats the separatist uprising in the eastern regions differently than it did in the case of Crimea, where it practically seized an area of 2 million people whose population is ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are non-Russian ethnically and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin practical power in the region that connects Crimea with Russia.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the main Russian fleet, as well as commercial shipping ports and historic coastal sites.
In the area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia, there are also mines, factories and metal mills that produce vital products for the Russian military.
In his inauguration speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers – after new elections – consider constitutional changes to increase the power of regions outside the Ukrainian nuclear region to decide on their own economy and the status of languages.
His vision of independence, however, appears to differ sharply from that of the separatists, possibly armed and instigated by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin presented his latest demand to the Kiev government to negotiate with the Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further advances last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful region on the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the seizure of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsk is the beginning of a larger effort to seize the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to a massive fortification of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. With half a million inhabitants, Mariupol is known as a steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to European Union leaders on Saturday in Brussels calling for further action to prevent Russia’s future insults in Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon reach a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko said.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not make any decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed the development of additional sanctions in order to enforce them in the event of a re-emergence of the Ukraine crisis under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian tanks and 1,000 troops moved to the Donetsk region last week to reinforce troubled separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers from the Russian siege in Ilovaisk were exchanged for 10 Russian parachutists captured in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
The opening goal was scored by Japanese Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit first and Jeremy Menez a penalty.
At the end of the game, Laziok got a tough goal, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan from Real Madrid this season.
In the training debut of Milan's former attacker icon Inzaghi, the San Siro stadium was only halfway off.
The contest was attended by 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko in the midst of the nude photography scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged by hackers who may have stolen the naked pictures of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Greco.
The entertainment world has cluttered since a series of naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted on the internet as a result of a widespread celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to possess a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, including top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Melbourne-based Greck also appear to have been stolen in connection with iCloud leakage.
There are 101 names on the list.
Edelsten, who married Greece last month, told Confidential: “This is outrageous.”
All personal contacts and photos should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and spread.
Greckon, who is in New York,ly commented on the incident in the online newspaper as “shameful” and said the victims “feel embarrassed.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with his previous boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer on the edge of the pool.
Palmer’s earnings include the movie “Love and Honor” with counteractor Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ that "this is a ruthless breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing stolen pictures on a mobile phone is no different than selling stolen items.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, already only from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like at home and rose to a sensational victory over Cuba in the World Cup in airball.
Look at the fan photos.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not the Polish's red-white but the Finnish's blue-white.
Finland’s victory was followed in the Spodek arena by 2,000 Finnish supporters.
It was like playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game,” Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland had already lost 0-2 in the match, but came to victory 3-2 in the match.
In the fourth quarter, Finland scored six points.
Cuba led the round 16-10, but then the Finns got the glimpse.
However, a few hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter plane could not land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So the fans in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a fast pace in recent days.
At the World Basketball Championship in Bilbao, Spain, there are more than 8,000 fans.
As if every basket of Finland had been the winning basket of the match, American star Stephen Curry praised Finnish fans after Saturday’s match.
The meeting will not be sent directly due to technical problems.
