Welsh Assembly Members Concerned About 'Sitting Like Fools'
Some members of the Assembly are in a state of panic over the proposal to change their name to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made as a result of a plan to rename the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the various political parties are concerned that this move will lead to ridicule.
A Labour Party member of the Assembly said he was concerned that "the name has a spelling similar to TW and PW".
To the knowledge of readers outside Wales: TWP means 'foolish' in Welsh and PWP means 'dirty'.
A playdate PM said his group as a whole was "not happy" and they suggested other names.
He commented that his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but that the word from MWP to Muppets is a short phraseological crossover.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the name change legislation, said: "The final decision regarding the description of what to call the members of the Assembly will certainly be discussed among the members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public opinion and received widespread public support for the Assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
In relation to the status of Assembly Members, the Commission favored the names of MPs or WMPs, but the name of MWP was the most supported in the public opinion poll.
It is clear that the members of the Assembly are proposing other names, but the struggle to reach a consensus will be headache-free for the presiding officer, Ellen John, who is expected to submit a draft law on the change in weeks.
The Act on Amendments will include other changes related to the way the Assembly works, including disqualification of Assembly Members and design of the Committee System.
When the law is debated, the members of the Assembly will have a final vote on what they will be called.
Macedonia is about to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote is set to resolve decades-long dispute with its own province, Macedonia, and neighboring Greece.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents its claim to a territory, and has consistently rejected its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is an opponent of the name change-related plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the only price to be paid for membership in the European Union and NATO is the renaming.
The churches of Harlem are in trouble because of the silence of the monks of St. Martin.
"Historically, the elderly people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church in every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there are no two".
He says it's understandable that bars are gone.
"Today, people interact in different ways", he said.
"There are no living rooms in bars for people to go on a regular basis".
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leadership expected, "and will soon return to where they started".
He added that apartment buildings with rented rooms filled with people who are not able to help the remaining biotechnology centres in the area can be built in place of mosques.
"The majority of people who buy rental rooms in such buildings will be white", he said, "so it will accelerate the day when all churches close together, because most people who move to rental rooms like these are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations, Harlem became a black hell later, and Harlem became a metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's 10 years later.
The first white Methodist church moved out of here in the 1930s.
The Black church that was worshiping nearby gave the building its name.
St. Martin's Church was seized by the Congregation of the Black under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, and led the expulsion of the small merchants on 125th Street, who were also led by the Reverend John, because the street, the main shopping center in Harlem, was too short to employ or encourage black people.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building but the parishioners of Father Johnson prepared plans for the building's renovation, and they commissioned Carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly called Carillon "the Church of the Poor".
In July, an expert reading Carillon described it as something else: "a cultural treasure", "an irreplaceable historical device".
For the first time in the world, it was the first carillon read by a black musician, according to Tiffany N.G. of the University of Michigan. This black musician was Dionysius E. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mary Weather said St. Martin's could not find anyone else to replace him.
A complex story has been told in St. Martin's over the past few months of architects and contractors, some of whom were called by the church's Almighty leadership, some brought by the Episcopal formation.
Westry, the governing body of the parish, which includes the Alma leaders, wrote to Formato in July about their concerns that while Westry had nothing to do with hiring the architects and contractors who sent the Formato, the letter stressed the issue of "paying money" to the Formato.
Some parishioners complained that there was a lack of transparency in the form.
In California, a 13-year-old lobster diver was injured by a shark.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while drowning in the sea for the Koch on Saturday, the opening day of the Koch season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. off Beacons Beach, Nsinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSW B-TV in San Diego that while diving in the sea for about half an hour with his friends on Sunday morning, he heard a boy crying for help and was approached by his friends and pulled him out of the water.
I thought the boy was making a noise because of the excitement of getting the punch, but I thought, "I got a knife!
Hamel said he only realized that he was screaming, "I got a knife".
"His entire thigh was torn open", Hamel said, "and he noticed it when he found the child".
"I called everyone out of the water and said: 'There was a shark in the water!'" added Hamel.
The child was airlifted to San Diego Radie Children's Hospital, where the hospital officials said the child's condition is critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
A few weeks ago, Life Guards Captain Larry Gills told reporters that a shark was spotted in the area but was being determined not to be a species of danger.
Gills added that the child had trauma injuries to the upper body.
For security reasons, authorities have closed access to Swami in Nesinitas from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, for 48 hours.
Gills said there are over 135 species of sharks in the area but they are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's to capture the UK beauty market
Seinsbury is preparing to face off against the brands of boots, super drugs and denhanhams by opening department store-style beauty shops with specialist assistants.
As part of its focus on the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, Seinsbury plans to open Beauty Isles in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, will open more stores next year, with sales of fashion goods and home appliances in the UK down, but the beauty market is booming.
The investment in the beauty sector is part of the efforts of supermarkets to take advantage of the shelf space used for TVs and microwaves.
Seinsbury said that the number of cosmetics will be doubled to 3,000 products, which will include the brands RevLone, SC, Twiserman and Dr. Paupao for the first time.
Current product lines such as Loreal, Mabyline and Buttebis will also have more space with similar branded spaces, as seen in shops such as Shoes.
The supermarket is once again introducing a range of boutique make-up, with most products being vegan-friendly, which are the products that young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, fragrance shop, a perfume retailer, will be tested with discounts at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be operational at Selby Oak, Brimmingham, later this year.
We are seeing a trend of online shopping and small-scale daily food purchases from local convenience stores, which means there is a lot to be done to get people to visit supermarkets.
Sayensbury's chief executive Mike Coop said that as supermarket chains compete against discount firms like Aldi and Lidell that sell more services and non-food products, outlets will be like department stores as the numbers increase.
Seinsbury is opening Argos Outlets in hundreds of stores, and has introduced Habitat Outlets in many stores, both of which were acquired by Seinsbury two years ago, which has increased retail sales and the acquisition of the chains is more profitable, the company says.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refurbish the Beauty Department and Pharmacy Department was a failure.
In the early 2000s, Seinsbury tried a joint venture with Boot Sumi, but the collaboration ended in disputes over the sharing of revenues from the chemist stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Seinsbury's 281 stores to Celseo, owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
By adding a unique range of premium skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vicky to its four stores, the company said Lloyds will also play a role in the project.
Sayensbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hicks, commented: "We have drastically changed the look and feel of our beauty islands to improve the atmosphere that our customers enjoy.
We have also invested heavily in recruiting specially trained assistants who provide advice and guidance.
Our range of brands is designed for all purposes, and attractive atmosphere and convenient locations mean that we are now becoming a cosmetic destination that challenges the old way of shopping and is unavoidable to customers".
Peter Jones is "angry" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million deal.
The star was angry when TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 deal with Dragons Den star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to spend on a home-grown accessory brand.
People have compared the pair's business to the group brand of Gainet Paltrot.
The 37-year-old announced on her Instagram account that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby's last-minute exit from the lucrative lifestyle brand business has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den - who has pulled out of the deal to focus on his new big deals with Marks, Spencer and ITV.
A source close to the couple said that he was angry when the Golden Female on TV agreed to a riot at Jones's business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, at the Kingdom Headquarters that he did not have time to devote to the home-wear and accessory brand Truly because of the new contracts - £1.5 million.
Their business is compared to the likes of Gainet Paltrot's Goup, which would have doubled Willoughby's current estimated £11 million fortune if he had stayed in business.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones's flight left the UK to go to one of her holiday residences.
A news source says: "For a long time, Halloween has been a priority.
It was a long-term initiative that could have helped Holly financially for the next one or two decades.
Holly's decision to withdraw has shocked everyone involved in the initiative.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because the launch of this initiative was due soon.
At Marlowe's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of merchandise to sell".
Experts believe that the withdrawal of Morning Presentation, one of Britain's most financially viable stars, will be a major liability for the company, as it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to textiles and homewares, and the launch could be delayed.
This withdrawal means that this will be the end of their long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Ballard, were friends for over ten years with Winnie Jones and Tara Cappu.
Willoughby Truly started with Coffee in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the company that makes Baldwin.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing McPartly, the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity, with Willoughby.
"We will not comment on his business affairs", sources close to Jones said last night.
After a good fight, we fell in love.
He also mocked media criticism for making a "disrespectful" comment and for keeping the North Korean leader in a position of optimism.
Why did the President give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the sound of "news anchor", making fun of it.
"I have left nothing behind".
Trump said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which he praised as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament talks are still pending.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "relevant response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He said that the US would continue to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his rally address, Trump shared a more optimistic view.
"We have good relations with North Korea", he said.
"We were sitting in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died in it.
We have a good relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results such as halting rocket tests, helping to free the hostages and bringing back the remains of the man to his homeland.
He also justified his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy for the president to talk like he should, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of this confined space, we'll have about 200 people standing here right now", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds of people
For example, after the Lompoc earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, but a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are clear that international assistance should not be requested, which is a bit challenging", said Ms Sambang.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palau, it is not certain whether foreign officials will be able to work there.
The National Disaster Agency (NDA) spokesperson, Shri Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palau to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to relief efforts.
Considering the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country still remains unprepared for the natural outbreak.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Asiha, it is not a common sight on other beaches.
Despite the warning being in effect, the apparent absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palo Alto is likely to accelerate the loss of life.
Traveling to many Indonesian islands, even in the best weather, can be challenging.
Natural disasters make freight transport more complicated.
The hospital ship, which was stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims, has now departed for Palau, but it will take the ship at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
During the election campaign, President Joko Widodo announced that he would improve Indonesia's infrastructure, but he spent only a week on roads and railways.
As Mr Joko is up for re-election next year, the lack of money has crippled his administration.
The Minister also faces pressure from the sectarian issues that have been plaguing Indonesia, and the majority of the country's Muslims want to follow a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs using knives, arrows, arrows and other deadly weapons in the streets.

Daniel Stirridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea, and Daniel scored the goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge, London.
Stiridge received the pass from Zerdane Shakiri when he was about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal post, this time Liverpool were 1-0 down.
Sturridge hit the ball to his left side before hitting the ball to face the post.
This attempt flew the ball over the box and the ball rolled over the upper right side of the net.
The ball fell on the body of the jumping Kopa Arisabalaga and finally shakes the net.
"I was trying to be in that position to get the ball, and always a player like Shaq would push the ball as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Stirridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kane running, I touched one of the balls, and then I didn't think much, I took the shot".
With the goal scored by Belgian Eidan Hazard in the 25th minute, Chelsea were ahead in halftime with a score of 1-0.
In that match, the Blues striker gave Matteo a pass before turning almost halfway through the pitch and jumping to Liverpool's half.
In the middle of the field, Kowakick took a quick give-and-go pass.
Then he led Hazard to the box, gave Kowaki a beautiful throwing ball.
Hazard, who ran the defensive line, batted left-footed, and the ball that passed Liverpool's Allison Baker, shoved the net.
In the Champions League group stage, Liverpool will face Napoli at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
In the UEFA Europa League, Chelsea will face off against the United in a video game on Thursday afternoon at 3pm.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The country's Disaster Agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
The agency's spokesperson, Sutupo Parvo Nugroho, told a news conference that several people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and the waves rose to 20 feet after the quake.
The city of Pallu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is scattered among the ruins of collapsed buildings.
The motherfucker died, and the police arrested 32 men on suspicion of murder.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Brickhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Gray Sun Museum on John Street with blunt force trauma and 32 men have been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have been asked to step forward to provide evidence to anyone who has seen or heard anything unnatural in the area.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to ask those living on John Street and the surrounding area in Brickhead to come forward and provide evidence to those who have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us, and there may be some footage in the driver's dash cam footage, as this information may be critical to our investigation.'
Police said the bodies were from a resident of Brickham and were found inside a property.
Friends who believe they know the dead woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where the body was found.
Police said that the investigation is ongoing and they are prepared to inform the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Museum tried to get into his flat, but police said people were blocked from entering or leaving the building.
When the taxi driver found out what happened, he was stunned.
Residents have now been informed that it will take hours for the entrance to and from the building to be withdrawn.
I heard a man say that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
I saw a woman standing at the scene crying.
They kept saying, "It's been terrible".
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
A handful of police officers were monitoring the block of flats from inside the cordon.
The information is requested to anyone with the information to send a direct email to @MerPolCC or call 101 or call the Crime Stoppers without giving their name on 0800 555 111 with the log '247 30 September'.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has been the subject of the latest monument demolition by the 'historical distortion' controversy.
Cromwell's removal of the statue was to be called poetic justice, because the cultural remains and religious artifacts of England were destroyed by his religious-mad Puritan followers, as the Taliban had done.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Cricket's proposal as "stupid" and an attempt to "write history".
John Gold Smith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: "The current discussion on the removal of statues made it imperative that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, which was erected outside the Palace of Westminster, become the target.
The sculptural events of the English Civil War were never at the behest of Crowell, nor did Cromwell.
False Cromwell is now being sacrificed for the events of the previous century by his predecessor, Thomas Cromwell.
The wonderfully crafted Cromwell statue by Sir William Hammock Tonecraft is evidence of a 19th-century view of Cromwell and part of the history of a leader who many consider to be still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "While he was in his monarchy, Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps many, in the late 19th century, to be the man who protected the Parliament from pressure from outside forces, more than he is today.
Whether it is a complete and accurate representation is an ongoing historical debate.
It is a matter of dispute that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation over time and that Cromwell is a recognized individual leader representing one of the two divisions.
His achievements as 'Lord Protector' should be celebrated and remembered".
A Chinese farmer was killed by a pig.
Local media reported that a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
A man known as 'Yuang' was killed, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday, after he was found with blood vessels broken and bathed in blood near a pigsty market in Lupanchu, Guangzhou province.
In Sining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2015, a pig farmer prepares vaccines for pigs in a pigsty.
Reports said he arrived with a relative from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell his 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he was found dead by relatives and a herd of pigs was found in the open.
The relative said there was a large pig in the cage bleeding from its mouth.
According to the report, the forensic investigation revealed that a pig weighing 550 pounds knocked the farmer down and killed him.
The so-called 'woo' said: "My cousin's legs were covered in blood and his legs were in a pinched state".
Security camera footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that attacked is not the victim's or the victim's relative's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent someone from attacking, and police have gathered evidence from the scene of the murder.
Reports indicate that the family and the market authorities are in consultation to seek compensation for the death.
Although rare, there have been recorded instances of pig attacks on humans before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured in the attack.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer was thrown into a 650-pound pig tractor, and his wife saved the farmer by scaring the pig.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon who was killed and eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba researcher told CBC News that although pigs are not generally aggressive, blood tastes may be a 'cause'.
"They're playing.
They're biting, very inquisitive, and they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect", the farmer said.
As part of the end of Hurricane Rosa, heavy rainfall is expected to hit the southwestern United States.
According to weather forecasts, the storm is weakened as it moves over the cool seas of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, the rose will bring heavy rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa is blowing at a rate of 85 meters per hour as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday morning, a Category 1 hurricane, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head south by Sunday.
A cloud formation has begun over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward and reaching the west coast of the U.S. As a tropical storm reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, Rosa will begin to push heavy tropical moisture northward and southwestward into the U.S.
On Monday, it will rain 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, the response of tropical moisture and approaching hail will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Rainfall of 1 to 4 inches, which can cause local flash flooding and landslides, could lead to landslides in the desert.
In some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, heavy tropical moisture can cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour.
In the southwestern part of the state, especially over Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, there is a possibility of sudden flooding due to rapidly worsening conditions.
It is strictly advised not to go to the desert without safety of vehicles when threatened by tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall will make the hills into torrents, thunder and lightning, and local winds and dust will cause disturbances.
The approaching hailstorm will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Overall rainfall is expected to exceed an inch, which could lead to small swirling and dirt roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region this year.
Tropical rainfall will approach Arizona on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, and will become a widespread rainfall on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in four directions on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
Because the Arctic is cooling but the tropical wave is still really hot, there will be a sharp change in temperature throughout the US in October.
Sometimes, this can lead to dramatic temperature fluctuations between short distances.
A perfect example of dramatic temperature fluctuations across the central U.S. can be expected on Sunday.
Temperature variations between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, and Nebraska, and between St. Louis, Des Moines, and Iowa, are about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will begin to rise and expand again.
In most parts of the Central and Eastern U.S., October is expected to begin with a warm start, with a widespread 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
On Tuesday, New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees, which could be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests that there is a high risk of above-average temperatures in the western U.S. through the first half of October.
The trial of Brett Kavanaugh was watched by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and woman Christine Blazeford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in 1980 on six television networks.
Meanwhile, despite the interruption of regular programs by broadcasters for Friday's last-minute turnaround, political parties continue to maintain a distance on the issue; the turnaround was a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had been caught at a high school party and tried to take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a callous testimony that he was 100% sure that nothing like that had happened.
On Friday, Nielsen reported that more than 20.4 million people may have seen it.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewership information from the Met networks where the news was broadcast, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, is not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen has technical difficulties in taking the number of people sitting in offices watching TV shows.
And to put it another way, it has the same audience size as people watching a football game or an Academy Awards ceremony.
Commentators on the Fox News Channel strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, which led to an average of 5.69 million viewers across all networks during the full day trial, Nielsen said.
ABC is the second largest with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS received 3.1 million viewers, NBC received 2.94 million, MS NBC received 2.89 million and CNN received 2.52 million.
After the trial, public interest in the matter continued to rise.
Flack was the main character in Friday's dramatic events.
The Republican's office, which said he would vote for Kavanaugh, issued a statement saying that the cameras of CNN and CBS had captured protesters chanting slogans against him on Friday morning as he tried to get on the elevator for a judicial committee hearing.
CNN broadcast live the scene where he stood and looked down for several minutes when people were angry with him.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have power when there are so many women who are powerless", someone told him.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and that he had more to say at the committee meeting before closing the door of the lift.
Later, while the committee voted to decide whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination forward to the full Senate for a vote, it was broadcast live on all cable networks and broadcast networks.
However, Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would prosecute the nomination charges next week, which is what the minority Democrats are demanding.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talks with Crown and later several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flack's decision was powerful because it was clear that the Republican Party had no votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister says critics of Brexit are 'playing politics'
In an interview with the Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of 'playing politics' on Britain's future and underestimating national interest in connection with her plan to leave the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May is attending the Conservative Party Conference in Brimmingham, UK, on 29 September 2019.
The front page of Theresa May's interview also featured an interview with Boris Johnson, former Theresa May's foreign minister, who in the interview called the UK and EU's proposal to impose tariffs on each other a 'general outrage' and reinforced his attack on Theresa's 'Checkers Plan for Brexit'.
Way of the Sims shooting: Police arrested Dayton Simpson, suspected of killing an LSU star
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting dead 20-year-old Way DeSimm, a basketball player at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for 'second degree' murder.
Police said that the video footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson was released, and that Sims lost his glasses during the assault.
Police recovered glasses from the scene of the murder, which contained samples of Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Weidi.
The lawyer reports that he must have a bond for $350,000.
An initial report by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office on Friday said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The Department of Police is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the local community for their assistance in conducting the investigation into the arrest.
LSU's Director of Litigation, Joe Aleva, thanked law enforcement authorities in the area for their "consistent vigilance and efforts for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Ward said the team was "broken" and "in great shock" upon hearing of Wye Day's death.
"This is what you're always worried about", said the Word.
A volcanic eruption in Mexico City has dripped ash
The ash of the Popocatepetel volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital city.
After the volcano was activated and gas and ash were released for more than 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management on Saturday warned residents to stay away from the volcano.
The Centre was monitoring multiple noise and companies.
Like Xochimilco, images of people wearing thick, gray glasses on car windows on the outskirts of Mexico City were circulating on social media.
In September 2017, geophysicists noticed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, following an earthquake that struck central Mexico at a magnitude of 7.1.
The volcano, which has been active since 1994, is known as "Don Goyo".
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the election year.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after riots broke out between pro-independence protesters and police, and thousands attended demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's double voting in connection with the departure.
The police responded to a wave of masked separatists throwing eggs at police and pouring dust paint, which led to the creation of black clouds of dust on the streets that were usually crowded with tourists.
Police used a lathe to control the fight and there were spears and thunder in the streets.
While pro-independence groups chanted for hours the slogan "Don't forget, don't forgive", Unionist protesters chanted the counter-slogan "May Spain survive".
Local media reported that 15 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
A year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal but Catalans supporting the split celebrated the referendum, tensions remain high in the free-minded areas.
Although a majority of voters supported independence, the majority of those opposed to the split abstained from voting, and the number of registered voters was very low.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in clashes later that year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Freedom groups camped through the night on Friday to stop the demonstration in support of the National Police.
Despite the progress of the demonstration, the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcisse Termes, 60, who was taking part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia's future of independence.
"The best moments of our lives were the last year.
I saw my religious parents crying with joy because they were able to vote, but now we are in a state of decay", he said.
Despite small but significant victories in the local elections held last December, pro-Catalonian independence parties are struggling to maintain their momentum this year, as some of the best leaders have gone into exile or some leaders are in reserve, holding a referendum and then declaring independence, awaiting trial in connection with their role.
John Pugh, 42, who was recording the protest in support of the police, told a mechanic on his phone that the leaders of both parties were stirring up a dispute.
"Things are getting worse", he said.
Orioles Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed since the end of last year before their trial, announced on Saturday that he will contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are seeing from the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate in the European elections", he said.
Lundenderi: People arrested for driving a car into a house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident began at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in the Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bleming said the gates and building were damaged.
It's possible that the crossbow in the car was shot at some point.
Living Stone's 1-0 win against Rangers on Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston led the team to victory.
Livingston shocked the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
With Holt's team promoted and Hibernian in second place, Dolly Menga's goal became a different one.
Gerard's team continues without a single win in the premiership this season, but next Sunday, they will face the top team, Hart Seane, who is 8 points ahead of them.
Prior to that, the Rangers were hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have extended their unbeaten leap to six games in the division, and Holt, who replaced former coach Kenny Miller last month, has yet to lose.
Livingston has wasted the best opportunities the visiting team has provided.
Holt's team had to be very forward before he scored, as their direct moves presented the Rangers with problems of all kinds.
Scott Robinbson broke into the opposing team and scored a goal but scored a goal in the goal, and Alan Litt Gaugh returned the header ball to Craig Halkett.
Livingston, the host who knew we could confuse visitors with their performance in the middle of the field, was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
That's how this important goal was born.
Rangers leaned on a freak, then Livingston attempted an opening, and along with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, Menga delivered the ball, which Menga would have, by hitting the ball from the middle of the box and scoring.
The Rangers held the ball the most time at that point, but the home team's defense was unbeatable, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly kept the right unchanged.
Despite the fact that the ball was knocked out by Alfredo Morelos, Kelly continued the same method until the second half.
Scott Pittman also tried to score but the Rangers' goal did not match, and Lit Gau played out of the open field in Livingston style but the ball fell out.
While crosses were continually coming into Livingston's box, they were all wasted, and two penalty claims were dismissed, alleging that Glenn Middleton, who came on as a substitute, showed Halkett Foul and was handball.
'Fact' from Livingston - Analysis
The BBC's Alas Day Lamond at the Tony MacRone Arena
A legendary performance and the aftermath of Livingston.
By continuing to exceed expectations on this journey upwards, they have excelled.
After returning to their top position, the style of play or teammates were rarely changed, but holding the team together after he took the position was to be commended for the excellence Holt showed.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was exceptional in his ability to put the defense in orderly positions, while Menga kept Connor Gold Sun and Joe Voral active throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked motivation to fail.
They played great under Gerard, and they've gone down that level.
They had no finishing ability, and they only managed to reach the goal face of the host team once, and this match is a warning to the Rangers because they are now down on the points standings.
Erdogan's mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies were in sight.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - a visit intended to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then, a giant went to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
It is the largest city outside Turkey with a population of Turkish origin.
Police have issued security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from crowding in front of the mosque, but a large number of Erdogan supporters have come to the compound to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - raised their voices, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to Germany.
The protest and cheerful expressions reflected the difference between some German Turks seeing the visitor as a hero and others insulting him as a dictator.
Deptford road accident: A bicycle passenger died in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 BST near Jung Shan, a busy road between Best Wood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and was examined by a paramedic, but the passenger died on the spot.
The accident occurred on Children's Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday, months after another cyclist was killed in this way.
The Metropolitan Police said that the authorities are working to identify the victim and inform close relatives.
The roads have been closed and buses have been diverted and drivers have been asked to avoid the scene of the accident.
Long Lartin Prison: Clash inside prison, 6 officers injured
The prison office said six prison officials were injured in the attack on the high security men's prison.
The riots broke out at around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Larten in Worcestershire, and the riots continue.
Specialist "Tornado" officials have been brought here to control the situation, and the encounter involving eight prisoners is taking place within a wing.
Officers with minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: "HMP has deployed specially trained prison staff to handle ongoing developments in Long Latin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will never forgive violence in our prisons, and those responsible for the violence will certainly be handed over to the police, who may have to stay in prison longer".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, there were reports that the prison governor was being treated for an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison staff were sent to prison with officers trained to manage violence in the face of a serious confrontation in which prisoners attacked with pool balls.
The threat of the Rose Hurricane to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which may be beneficial for dry areas) has raised the risk of flash flooding.
It is a rare phenomenon for a tropical depression to occur over Arizona, but this is exactly what will happen when the remaining force of the storm rose to the southwestern desert early next week, leading to sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will travel on a direct route over Phoenix and is expected to arrive in the rain on Monday afternoon.
"Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have brought hurricanes or low pressure!
Hurricane Katrina (1967), which hit 40 miles of the AES border, was the most powerful hurricane ever", the National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and isolated rainfall of up to 5 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, but may receive a total of isolated rainfall of up to 1 inch.
In areas that are not at risk of erosion-like flooding, the rain that roses bring can be a blessing, as the area is experiencing severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the South West is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. DROT Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the second-lowest and second-highest severity drought", reports Weather.com.
First to make landfall, the storm is moving across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The storm, which has no sustained winds of up to 85 mph on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 mph.
The storm's response to the cold waters of the Pacific will reduce wind power.
So, it is expected to reach the Mexican shore with the force of tropical winds on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall throughout parts of Mexico is expected to create a risk of sudden flooding.
"From Baja California to northwestern Sonora, there will be a total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, with a possible 10 inches in some places", reports Weather.com.
It then moved northward across Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then moving through Arizona to Teton Utah on Tuesday night.
"The major disaster expected from Rosa or its remaining power is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is expected to result in sudden life-threatening flooding, landslides in deserts and mudslides in mountainous areas.
Mid-Summer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old was found with imprinted notes in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
A teenager was found injured on the Excelsior Terrace in the Mid-Summer Norton area at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
The injured child was admitted to hospital, and the child's health remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man have been arrested from the Red Stock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
The officials have requested that if anyone has the footage of the incident, they hand it over to the police.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure the "little and bitter" Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to protest against the ruthless and unjust tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure "a little bit of the Democratic Party's bitterness and bitterness" throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying the allegation that she sexually assaulted herself when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified on oath at trial that his allegation was true.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the "depth, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Each vote for Judge Kavanaugh is voted by a judge with a history of ten years of public service and the most accomplished legal scholar of our time", he told his West Virginia followers.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican Party voting in the midterm elections, the President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination.
"One of the most important elections of our lifetime is just five weeks away.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing", he said.
"That's why I run everywhere, fighting for the great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and prevent".
In connection with Kavanaugh's nomination, a senior aide to the GOP leader told CNN that the first important procedural vote on the Senate floor will be on or before Friday.
Hundreds of people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the death toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed in the tsunami and tsunami that swept across the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, after large waves swept the beaches.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people gathered for the festival in the city of Palú, when waves hit the land at a height of six metres (18 ft), destroying everything in front and killing hundreds of people.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"While the tsunami threat was high yesterday, people were on the beach, and people who did not run away immediately following the warning were the victims", said Suduppo Parvo Ngrogoho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, BNPB, in Jakarta.
"Not only did the tsunami come, it flowed cars, trees and houses, and it hit everything on land", said Nugueroho, adding that before it hit the beach, the tsunami travelled at 800 km/h (497 mph) through the open sea.
He said that some people climbed to the top of trees to escape the tsunami and they were saved.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Pau.
Sky images released by the Disaster Management Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and mosques flooded.
On Saturday, the high waves that followed the end of the tsunami continued to hit the beaches.
2.4 A series of earthquakes were felt in a residential area.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on a long and narrow coast, may have increased the tsunami's intensity, the agency said.
Negroho said the damage was "extensive" and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were recovered from the ruins of the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people are missing.
Nugroho said the death and damage could be higher in the so-called Donggala coastal area, 300 km north of Palau and close to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication systems were disrupted without any information from Donggala, Nugraho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", said a statement from the Red Cross, adding that volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get worse", said the Red Cross.
The agency was widely blamed on Saturday for not warning of a tsunami in Paulu, but officials explained that the waves were hitting within the time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage of a man who is making a tsunami warning to people walking down the street from the top floor of a building is being circulated on social media.
Within minutes of the wall hitting the shore, it swallowed up buildings, cars, and everything in between.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm whether the footage is original.
Power was cut off due to the earthquake and tsunami and communication systems throughout the city were disrupted, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the survivors are in a situation where they lack food and other basic facilities.
The airport in the city is open for rescue operations only and the airport will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is visiting the shelters in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is bad.
World Vision staff members have escaped the tsunami and arrived in the city of Pallu, where they have been living in tarpolin tents in their own office yard, but they have been through the sights of destruction, Shri Dosebob said.
"They told me that they saw many houses being destroyed", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although relief teams have begun to rush to relief efforts, some complain that well-trained foreign volunteers have been prevented from travelling to Pau.
According to Indonesian law, only if a natural disaster is declared a national disaster by the government can foreign funding, supplies and volunteers benefit.
It has not yet been declared a national disaster.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government declares it a national disaster, we can make international aid arrangements, but there is still no such situation".
The second night after the tsunami on Friday is now approaching in the city of Paulo, and friends and relatives hope that the victims will return after the unexpected stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from an oval.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman from the rubble of the building, lying next to her mother's body.
For the Asian Games this month in Indonesia, two of the paragliders trained by Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono have been missing in the tsunami.
Others, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students who were trapped at the Rowa Rowa Hotel.
"As a senior in the paragliding industry, I have my own emotional stress", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that the news spread to the paragliding community within hours of the news of the collapse of the Rowa Rowa Hotel and that he constantly sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants attending the Beach Festival.
Instead of a pair of blue check marks, all the messages were given a gray check mark.
"I think this means that the messages have not been exchanged", he said.
$26,750 was stolen while filling up an ATM in Newport, Levy.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday, in Newport, Levy, brick officers stole $26,750 while filling in ATMs.
Detective Dennis McCarthy writes in a press release that the driver of the car was trying to fill an empty ATM in the entertainment complex.
While he was working, another person "run off the back of the Brink employee" and stole the bag of money he was bringing for delivery.
Witnesses said they saw several suspected criminals flee the scene, but the police did not say how many people were involved.
Any person with information about the offender should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper calls himself Jay-Z.
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to "Y".
On Saturday, he tweeted about his name change: "A person officially known as Kanye West".
For a time, the name was a double for 41-year-old West, who used the name for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change is expected to be shown on Saturday night's live broadcast and he is expected to release his new album 'Yandhi' at the event.
The show's creator said that West is coming in the name of Ariana Grande, who left the show for 'emotional reasons'.
West had previously said that the new name is not only the acronym for the current professional name but also that the word is of religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and 'ye' means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I am you, I am us, everything is us.
I went from Kanye, which means one, to you -- whether we're good or bad or confused, it's our reflection.
This album is a reflection of who we are".
West is one of the most famous rappers to ever change his name.
Sean Combs, known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P Daddy or Daddy, said that this year he liked the names Love and Brother Love.
The rapper, formerly of West's band, Jay-S, changed his name to Hyphen and without the capital letters.
The appointed Mexican president says he will not use the military against the common people.
As the country marches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students, military force will never be used against ordinary people, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador said.
Lopez Obrador said at the Plaza de Latelolco that "the military will never be used to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the peaceful demonstration in the Plaza was being repelled by the army, killing nearly 300 people, and the beginning of the left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support the Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to students who are studying and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are bringing the younger generation into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, investor and AI practitioner Kai-fu Li has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple to double US research spending in the region.
Kai-Fu Lee said this after various departments of the US government made AI announcements even if the US does not have an overall official AI policy.
China last year introduced a plan to lead innovation by 2030.
"Given the fact that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we are looking forward to the next advancement in AI", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could be the next big AI gain in the US.
Lee, who wrote a book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Half-Ton Mifflin Hardcourt, is now CEO of Sinovation Ventures, and has invested in Facebook+, China's most important AI company.
In 1980, he built an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later took a job as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee praised the impact of U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next generation of philosophers would be able to meet up.
Researchers in the US often struggle to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not corporate companies that take the best people to China for academia", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited successful alumni from Sur universities to work with AI in recent years.
Li said immigration policy changes could help support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think that those who are getting their PhD in AI should naturally have the status of getting a green card", Lee said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its 'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan'.
Li said that just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund US researchers, the National Natural Science Foundation of China is funding people in academia institutions, but the academy in China has a low level of activity.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an initiative aimed at engaging stakeholders from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DAPRA announced that it will invest $2 billion in AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been taken for months in connection with the US law requiring the creation of a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum to rename the country the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move intended to find a solution to a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union or NATO.
Since Greece has a province of Macedonia within its borders, Greece takes the position that the name of its northern neighbor Macedonia represents a claim to its territory, and therefore Greece has blocked Macedonia's applications for membership in NATO or the European Union with its veto power.
The two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argues that a name change would weaken the ethnic existence of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the exclusion campaign expressed suspicion that this minimum requirement would not be met as voting for the referendum would require at least 50 percent to be valid.
The ballot in the referendum read: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership in accordance with the agreement with Greece?"
The name change-supporting group, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that the price Macedonia must pay to seek access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO is the price that Macedonia has to pay to seek access to the EU and NATO; Macedonia is one of two countries that have emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the young generation in Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, the European Union means a safer life for all of us", said Oliveira Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje.
The Parliamentary Assembly has said that even though it is not legally in existence, the results of the referendum will be compliant with it.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of any irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66% of registered voters cast ballots, the voting rate was 36 per cent per hour, compared to just 16% in the referendum.
"I'm here to vote for my children, and Europe is our place", said Jos Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Soran Zaaye, his wife Zorica and son Dushku voted in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 to open the way to NATO and EU membership, in connection with the country's name change.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, in front of tents prepared by the referendum voters, Vladimir Kvardakov, fifty-four, would set up a small stage and pull chairs.
"We have no objection to joining NATO or the European Union, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kvardacov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can ask for help from China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaiev said that Macedonia, which currently has an unemployment rate of over 20%, will get the necessary investment and NATO membership.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the name change because 80% of our citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership", said Saiyev after the vote.
He said the result of "want" would be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters participate in the referendum - less than the required percentage.
According to a poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters participate in the referendum - less than the required percentage.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, we must get 50 percent of the vote and then one vote.
Failure to pass the referendum will be a serious blow to the government's policies, which took power in May and are aimed at the Western world.
See: Sergio Aguera of Manchester City, breaking through the entire British defence line
The British defence was tied by Sergio Aguera and Rahim Sterling, who won 2-0 against Manchester City in Saturday's match at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agüera scored in the 65th minute as easily as it seemed.
At the start of the effort, the Argentine striker was getting a pass in the middle of the field.
Before the ball hit the open field, Aguera jumped through three British defensive players.
And then you see Aguera wrapped in four green jerseys.
Aguera turned down a defender and defrauded several defenders by being next to Britain's goalkeeper.
Seeing Sterling on the left, Aguera handed over the ball.
The English forward, who returned the ball to Aguero as soon as he got it, then the Aguero hit the ball and then the right side of the net, cheating England goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguera has retail problems in her legs", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We told him about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal in that time".
But in the Premier League fight, the Sky Blues were given an initial priority by Sterling.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguera got the ball on the British border.
LeRoy Seyne, left-handed, handed the Aguera ball to a beautiful throwing ball.
Sign hit the ball for a while, then handed it over to the forward Sterling.
Sky Blues Forward pulled it into the net before the ball reached the boundary.
City will play Hohenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Necker-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55 p.m.
Sherzert's desire to play Spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's no reason to start again.
But Sherker, who always wanted to compete, wanted to get into a game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but that would only happen if the Rockies still had a playoff mindset, and the Rockies had a game lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NHL West.
The Rockies beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but they're still working on their first division title.
"Even if we play for nothing, we can at least rub our fingers knowing the atmosphere in Denver, which is crowded, and the other team will be at the top of any point I face this year.
Why can't I compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but Scherzer, who has expressed interest in such a situation, is likely to be allowed to do so.
Scherzer, who is about to take his 34th start, threw a bullpen Thursday and will be on his natural break on Sunday.
The washing-ton right-hander, Scherzer, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican Party voting in the midterm elections, the President indirectly mentioned the nomination of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
"The outcome of what we have done so far will depend on November.
One of the most important elections of our lives is just five weeks away.
And this is the biggest one -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running, which is why I run everywhere, fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see the horrifying, horrifying terrorist gangs of Democrats, and you see what's happening right now.
They are determined to return to power by whatever means necessary, that is, with a small and dirty way, as you can see.
They don't care who they hurt to get power and control, they don't care who they kick, they want power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and stop".
Asked "What have you seen in the last four days", Trump criticized the Democrats for being "full of anger, wickedness, a little bit of dishonesty".
When the Senate Judiciary Committee named ranking Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by Trump, the audience shouted.
"Do you remember their answer?
Did you pee on the paper?
Oh, what?
No, oh, no, I'll keep it -- it's really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a large party.
He will not forgive those who openly speak.
I was not surprised when momentum activists in my local party voted to warn me.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome - and I must remember that I have been open about it.
My parliamentary colleague, Joanne Ryan, who stood up for anti-Semitism, had the same experience.
In my case, the Thakur resolution criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, Jeremy has disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues, such as responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Saturday stated, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In almost all my eight years as a local Labour MP, GC meetings on Friday nights were like that.
Sadly, many meetings today are not like this, and the promise of "more kind, more gentle" politics has been forgotten for years, if such a promise has ever been made.
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party will not be tolerated, and each opinion will be judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started as soon as Jeremy became leader, and my colleagues, who I had previously thought had a similar political outlook, expected me to go in the opposite direction and adopt views on national security and the single market, the European Union, which I never agreed with.
Every time I address the public, there is a lot of hype on social media, regardless of the subject matter, some say I should be dismissed as an MP, I should leave the Union and I should not be in the Labour Party.
This isn't my only experience.
I am certainly more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are politically motivated.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual and racial scandals every day but never shy away from their heads.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that the levels of rioting are taken for granted.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn suggested that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are not a large church anymore, and the party is shrinking every time there is a "disbelief" issue, or changes in election rules.
And for the next two years, I've been getting a lot of advice that I should keep my head down and not talk so much, and then I'm going to be "right".
But that's not why I'm in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a school student, and I was really angered by the failure of the government of Tadhar to actually ground my entire school classroom, and I have always tried, as a local councillor or government minister, to provide better public services to those in need.
I have not hidden my politics under any circumstances, including the last election.
There should be no confusion about my policy views and areas of disagreement with my current leadership.
To those who promote Friday's resolution, I can only say that as the country moves towards Brexit that is hurting homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But I really want to send a message not to the Nottingham moment, but to the Labour Party supporters and non-supporters in my constituency: I am proud to serve you, and I can assure you that I cannot be deterred from interfering with threats of dismissal or political moves that I believe are in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr to the front without losing
While the previous two draws may have made the final score almost obsolete, it is certain that Ayr had won today's surprisingly interesting Twenty20 premiership match.
These two teams are the top 10 undefeated teams in the table.
In short, the team was led by their best defense and their courage to test the potential, and coach Peter Murchi has every right to be happy.
"Our ability has been tested in every match so far and they still have not lost so I am happy", he said.
"Air was rightfully old", comments Melrose's Robin Christy, "and he was the one who stood up to the prospect".
The attempt by Grand Anderson in the fourteenth minute was scored by Fraser Climax, who led the lead, but through the Warriors, the yellow card given to Scottish cap Rory Hughes for the match gave Melrose a chance, but Jason Baggott's attempt was unsuccessful.
With a penalty, the Iron was brought to the Climax lead, and before that, when it was almost half time, the Climax had made a solo effort to score 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and when Patrick Anderson's effort reached Baggott's goal, they were able to narrow the scoring gap to five points.
Ruaried's note was severely injured and the game was held up for a long time, and the AIR bounced back when the match resumed, with Stafford McDowell's effort and Climax reaching the goal.
Then the temporary captain of the Iron was given a yellow card, and Bruce Colvin couldn't get the chance to get Melrose in the magic circle of intense pressure.
Although the home side began to bounce again, in the penalty line-out, when Hutchinson received a yellow card for throwing the climax without the ball, McPherson made an attempt by jumping to the front of the lead.
Climax again reached the goal as he did when the match was resumed, before taking Rowe on a box kick from David Armstrong and sending Gregor Henry to the sidelines for the fifth try of the home side.
Still Game Star is looking for a new restaurant industry opportunity.
The world learned about this when he stepped into the hospitality industry, becoming the director of a restaurant company that has been licensed by the still game star Ford Kieran.
The 50-year-old star plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he also co-wrote with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemph.
The duo has announced that the ninth series will be coming soon, and this will be the show's final series, and Keeran seems busy planning his life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adrift Moon Ltd.
The star declined to comment on the news, but a Scottish Sun source suggests that Kearnan is about to focus on Glasgow's "growing restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The ships are patrolling the Rigging-Claid Naval Headquarters in Lapas.
A sea blue flag is being flown in government buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are decorated with the same motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to recover it".
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the 19th century bloody dispute over resources that forced them to surrender their coastline to Chile remains unchanged - a desire to sail across the Pacific once again.
This hope has been in place for decades, but it is now reaching its peak, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, which has been under consideration for the past five years.
"Bolivia now has a sense of calm, unity and hope for the outcome", said Roberto Calzadailla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICC pronounce the verdict on large screens across the country, and they expect the Tribunal of The Hague to treat Bolivia's claim with compassion, believing that after decades of volatile negotiations, Chile is obliged to consult on allowing Bolivia a full-powered route to the sea.
Bolivia's influential local president Evo Morales - who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year - has high hopes for Monday's ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he swore last August.
Some analysts believe that it is unlikely that a court ruling in favor of Bolivia will be announced, because nothing is going to happen if the court declares in favor.
The UN body, which operates in the Netherlands, has no power to rule on a matter within Chile's territorial boundaries and is not authorized to determine the outcome of the negotiations.
Pas Sarate, a Chilean expert on international law, said that the ICC's ruling came just six months after hearing the final arguments, suggesting the case was "not complicated".
In addition to advancing Bolivia's goal, developments over the past four years may have been a setback to this goal.
"The current issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government", Sarate said.
Morales' aggressive manner of speaking may have also leaked what remains of Chile's possible positive outlook on Bolivia, they noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at times, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold talks.
The two countries have not had ambassadors since 1962.
The idea that the court's decision was unusually fast was denied by former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague.
He said that the decision on Monday would provide Bolivia with an amazing opportunity to "open a new era of relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreements" regarding bilateral benefits.
Calsadilla denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was pushing the maritime issue for his political gain.
"Bolivia should never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says it will not achieve nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the nation would not disarm those who could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to be prepared to honour the promises made during the Enemy-to-Enemy Summit in Singapore.
His comments came when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began attempts to resume the nuclear-diplomatic talks that had stalled three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The continued escalation and the US's impeding declaration to end the Korean War would at any time bring North Korea to its knees, Ri said, as the "pipe dream".
First, the United States is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking any significant disarmament steps.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
As it is likely to be seen as the only way to ensure the security of the nation, there is widespread uncertainty as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning a war machine.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest line of the huge hat collection coming up on the High Street near you has been displayed in Parisian fashion.
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or cover the entire veil, you don't have to look elsewhere.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have released a series of crazy-looking oversized hats for their runway collection SS19.
The seemingly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers are bringing their eye-popping creations to the ramp.
Valentino's masterpiece was a light brown hat with wide edges like a feather that stood flat on the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-plated tines, a witch's hat, and a pineapple - but these hats were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks, many of which are ready to be used for Halloween.
These attractive colours of masks are embroidered on the lips of many, and these masks reminded of Hannibal lectur rather than horticulture.
One creation reminded me of a full-size scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while the other was like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're still in the big fashion frenzy, you're in luck.
According to fashion enthusiasts, these large size hats will soon be available in nearby shops.
These large-sized hats were made using the La Bomba style, which was a two-foot-wide, wicker-colored hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajuski.
The cult label behind the unpractical hats that went viral across social media led to another big creation, which was a straw beach bag as big as a swimsuit, and models walked around wearing it on the ramp.
The La Rivera SS19 collection was created from a separate creation from the Paris Fashion Week, a white leather handle, with a burnt orange raffia bag cut into raffia pots.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitake commented to Female: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the High Street next summer - because the designer has made such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, with another set of exceptional test results, which continued in 2018, and individual and cohesive success in sport, music and other community endeavors has strengthened academic excellence.
Represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SICS), the schools, which serve more than 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide the highest standard of service to students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare students for their future higher education, their chosen careers and their position as global citizens.
As an educational sector where an excellent school curriculum can be designed and implemented, we see that modern languages will continue to be a popular and desirable choice subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to someone in a language that is in their mind, it goes into their head.
But when you speak to him in his mother tongue, it enters his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that when she wants to maintain relationships with people from other countries and gain their trust, she cannot rely on English alone.
From the recent test results this year, we can see that the languages are the top in the league tables with the highest success rate among independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages have achieved Higher Grade A.
Data collected from SCSIS schools with 74 member schools shows that 72 percent of students have obtained a Higher A grade in Mandarin, 72 percent of students studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish have obtained an A grade.
This demonstrates that the independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and students will need in the future.
As with STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects in independent school curricula and elsewhere, languages are now considered a choice subject.
Employers have pointed out that 17 per cent of the reasons for the challenge of recruiting applicants for positions were language skills deficiency, according to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment Opportunities and Skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare students for future employment opportunities.
As languages are needed for future jobs, these skills are indispensable in a globalized world.
Whatever career path is chosen, if candidates have learned a second language, they will have a long-term skill set like this and will be really privileged in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will naturally put a person who knows multiple languages far ahead of the competition.
In 2013, a survey of more than 4,000 UK adults by YouGov found that 75 per cent of the respondents were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to start a conversation, and 15 per cent of the respondents said that French was the only foreign language they knew.
That is why investing in language teaching is becoming important for today's children.
Learning multiple languages, especially language proficiency in developing countries, will provide more opportunities for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
As a handful of schools focus on more classical modern languages, other schools will teach languages that are considered to be important to the UK in the blink of an eye, like Mandarin or Japanese, by 2020.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a handful of languages to choose from within independent schools with teachers who are skilled in foreign language.
Although we do not know what the future holds, Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children for success in life and equipps them with the skills they need to succeed.
In a global business environment, it is now undeniable that languages will remain an indispensable factor for the future of the country, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for children in Scotland.

LeBron is playing for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
This is the end of the fan-waiting for the first time ever for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the length of James's playing time has not yet been determined.
"The time will be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Treddle tweeted that James will only play for a limited time.
After his first practice this week, James was asked about the Lakers' pre-season schedule for the Six-Six.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
Trump's time at the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies planned for next week in Tennessee and Mississippi, where the crowd is growing.
In addition to securing the vote for his nominee in the Supreme Court, Trump is also aiming to increase public support ahead of the November midterm elections, as there are concerns that the Republican Party will lose control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. eastern time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below, via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump may have mentioned the case of Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh's trial this week, which is complicated by the high-profile sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, which the Senate has postponed for a week due to an FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of the conference is to give a little boost to the Republican Party, which is facing the November election.
So, according to Reuters, those who were watching President Trump's campaign said that the goal of the five rallies next week was "to energize volunteers and supporters as the party tries to maintain and increase the Republican majority in the House of Representatives".
Congressional control is critical to the president's agenda, so we're warming up campaigns and he'll visit states as much as possible, a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters, but declined to reveal his name.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally at Wesban Co Arena in Wheeling will draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media attention.
Trump also visited West Virginia last month, his second visit since Saturday's rally, where he won the state in the 2016 election with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrissey, who is far behind in the polls.
"The fact that the president has to come to dominate the opinion polls is not a good sign for him", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show their bravery in keeping up expectations as they move into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, it's likely that the Saturday afternoon ForceMe was the one that needed to get this year's Ryder Cup right.
While the pace of the game in flux is entirely a fabricated command, players believe it is something that is actually there, especially in games like this.
So where is the priority now?
"They were six points ahead, four now, so I guess that's a little leap with us", Jordan Speeth said as he left after the game.
Europe, with four points ahead, has a clear lead in the 12-game series.
However, as Speeth says, Americans feel that the wind is a little more favorable for them and that they have plenty to be brave. Speeth and Justin Thomas's game of chess are no less encouraging.
In From Tea to Green, the deadly player, Speeth, is a role model for others.
After playing two games, with both Speed and Thomas two points behind, the festivities were made louder when a key 1pot 2 (square pit) spit was made to bring the match to four-square.
His dog, who won the race in '15, received the same celebration, and the celebration was on the roof telling people that he believed the American team was not out of the game.
"You really need to know and care deeply about your game", said Speeth.
That's all that's left for every player now.
18 holes to prove excellence.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points than Speat and Thomas in the last two days, and the Ryder Cup has an undeniable history.
The twins are not wrong with the European side, who won four out of four.
The only couple who didn't take a booby shot on a Saturday afternoon was the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but they decided not to take a booby shot on a Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and then on a Friday morning when they played the last nine holes.
They are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and that is a sign of the way the noise of the crowd seems to be flowing their energy around you.
It's best if you both play different holes at the same time.
However, talking about European glory remains a matter of time.
The morning of the Forbes hero Sergio Garcia, when he was playing alongside Alex Noren, was treated fairly badly by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson.
One boxer and two doubles in the first nine holes threw the Spaniard and the Swede into an impenetrable hole.
But on Sunday, there's no one to get you out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look at Forbes and Forms up close because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and the way any strategy can change in an instant.
Europe, which has so far been a poor team, is heading into the final day with a good lead, but this Forms session has also shown that Team USA, some of whom, especially their country, were suspicious, had a battle-ready spirit.
Europe to the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead
Europe, which emerged from Saturday's games at Forbes and Forms with a 10-6 lead over the United States, is heading for the final day of the Ryder Cup with a healthy lead.
Inspired pairs Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way to their four-point lead in the Le Golf National with two wins against Tiger Woods, who struggled to play.
Thomas Jorn's European side, trying to recover the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltaine, dominated the American side that led the series to a 3-1 mark in the morning for the morning.
The U.S. won two games in the Forces, but it was not able to overcome the resistance.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to keep the title, they need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points. Meanwhile, he and Molinari, who was named Molinari after an exciting weekend, are the only other pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four matches.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the Forbes, then teamed up to beat the confident Woods and the American newcomer, Bryson DeCambeau, who was even more fucked up than 5&4, and then came together to beat the incredible.
Woods, who was pulled from the bench by two games on Saturday, showed explosive mid-range explosions but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the Forballs and Forms, including seven in a row.
After a break from the morning Forbes, Justin Rose, along with Henrik Stensen, returned to Forms to defeat World No. 1 and No. 3 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copke, 2&1.
However, on that comfortable, windy day southwest of Paris, Europe could not take everything for granted.
Three-time Major winners Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas set a two-point mark for the Americans on Saturday.
In the Forboles they secured a hard 2&1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter, then a 2&1 win over Forcemes and Rory McElroy, who came back to beat 4&3 after losing their opening two holes.
Although Furyk's side needed a draw to keep it as the trophy holders, only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team come back from four points short when going to singles.
Despite two days in second place, it looks like Sunday's counterattack will be beyond them.
North Korea says there is no "way" to unilateral disarmament because of a lack of faith.
The continued sanctions have increased distrust in the United States and there is no way the country can unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such circumstances, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday.
North Korea last year took "significant steps for the sake of fame", Ri Yong said at the UN's annual general assembly, beginning with a pledge to halt nuclear tests and missile tests, demolish nuclear testing sites, and not spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any similar response from the US", he said.
"There is no confidence in our national security without any confidence in the US, and in such circumstances we have no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first".
Although Ri repeated the familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the phased approach to nuclear disarmament, his statement is significant because, as Pyongyang has done before, he did not deny that unilateral nuclear disarmament is not in hand; and he argued that since they have taken steps to disarmament, North Korea should benefit.
Ri mentioned that at the summit in Singapore on June 12, Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump issued a joint statement in which Kim pledged to work towards nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has always insisted that Pyongyang should abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed calls for easing the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is pushing for 'nuclear disarmament first' and increasing the pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing 'declaration of war'", said Ri.
"The idea that we will be knocked down by sanctions is a pipe dream of people who don't know about us.
The problem is that our distrust is growing because of the continuing sanctions".
Re did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had mentioned at the UN a week earlier.
Instead, referring to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, the minister added: "If it were South Korea, not the United States, who was a party to the nuclear disarmament issue, then the Korean Peninsula would not have been at such a disadvantage".
However, the tone of Lee's present speech was dramatically different from that of Lee's speech at the UN last year. Lee said that Kim was "Rocket Man" when "Mr. Devil President" Trump called him a suicide attempt and that North Korean rockets aimed at the US mainland were therefore necessary.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea altogether last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations this year, but said that more steps still needed to be taken and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea achieves nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this, adding, "It's okay, it takes two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia have argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for its actions so far.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions proposed by the Security Council must continue vigorously until complete, definitive and verifiable nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously raised sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Rie Pompeo met him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
Although he left Pyongyang saying progress was made, North Korea condemned his "demands like raising a gang" within minutes of his departure.
At its meeting on 3 March, North Korea promised that if the United States took similar steps, it would destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex.
He said that Kim had told him that similar measures were required to ensure the security guarantees guaranteed in Singapore and steps towards normal contact with washing toilets.
Harvard students are studying a course on getting enough sleep.
This year, a new course has been introduced to all students at Harvard University to help them get more sleep, and it's a fight against the growing culture of 'macho' studying through caffeine and sleeping through the night.
One academic found that students at the world's top university often lack clarity on the basics of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Sisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first course of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"A girl came up to me at the end of the talk and said, 'I'm in my final year. What's the matter with me now?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - this surprised me", he told Telegraph.
First introduced this year, this course explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits are academic, how they help latex performance and how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were experiencing severe insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books, and they can hear about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects lattic performance due to sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleeping habits.
Another section explains to students how long-term insomnia increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages students to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke, we believe they have a right to know", added Professor Sisler.
He said that a culture that prides itself on saying 'learned without sleep' still exists, and that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means insomnia is a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get good quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said. "When we're not sleeping to avoid weight, we're pushing the brain into starvation mode, which causes continuous hunger".
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped design the course for Professor Sisler, who attended the class last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired the entire campus to take this course.
He hopes that next, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competition-based institution.
Professor Sisler recommended that students who wear alarms should be advised when to sleep and when to wake up, and should be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting; this blue light will weaken your circadian rhythm in a more casual fashion, and then cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeated Gerard's players
When Dolly Menga's footballer Steven Gerrard left the disintegrated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston, the Rangers were once again troubled by their permanent departure from the left.
The Ibrokes were looking to record their first competitive win outside the side since their 4-1 win at St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's side suffered only the second defeat of 18 games as Gerard's manager, leaving the Ladbrokes eight points behind the uncontrollable champion Hartz of the Premiership.
The goal was scored seven minutes before the break, but the under-inspired Rangers didn't seem to be able to make it back.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston is up to third, just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
The fact that the lineman's stone hit the head with an object that looks like someone threw from the rear could make it harder for the Rangers to take care of Spence.
Gerard made eight appearances for the team that reached the Betfred Cup Safe Finals by kicking Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, landed the same Levi 11 that scored a point from Hearts last week. The well-trained team must have made him so happy that he breathed his opponents at every turn.
Although the Rangers may have dominated the position, Livingston handled the ball well.
They were supposed to score when Scott Pittman sent Menga's first Leof pass to Alan McGregor's goalpost in the second minute of play, but that midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
Although a highly skilled freak of Kagan Jacobs approached Captain Craig Hallett, his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit a shot that raised him to the back post.
The Rangers took control, but they were more likely to have confidence in their front-line game.
It was obvious that Alfredo Morelos should have received a penalty when he and Steven Lawless were beaten in the 15th minute, but referee Steven Thompson rejected the appeal of the Colombian.
The Rangers only saw two shots in the first half, but a head of Lasanna Coliballi and a hard-hitting kick from Owie Izzaria did not bother former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Although Levi's 34th minute goal was against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it if their agreement was reached.
The Rangers failed again to handle a highly skilled setpiece of Jacobs.
When Deccan Gallagher delivered the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not respond. Robinson chose Mengen to complete the simple without giving up his calm.
Gerard responded by dropping Ryan Kent instead of Cooleyby, and the change almost caused a sudden shock. He played wing with Morelos, but heartbreaking Kelly jumped out of his line to stop it.
But Livingston was exactly keeping the visitors in the game they enjoyed.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor denied Jacobs and Lithgow the opportunity.
When Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton teamed up with Jacobs, he argued for another late penalty, but again Thompson denied it.
Panchangan: The expert on Geiger counters
Now, a page from our "Sun Day Morning" five-part series: September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a major reference in science, has become a staple of pop culture, and can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboy scientists:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can hear the effects of radioactivity generated by atoms in minerals".
"Tell me, it's going to explode now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, which bears his name, still stands today.
The new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'find' the stem cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system how to find and kill the stinking cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the stem cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and replace them in a lab.
Then, they can 'see' a common protein that causes many cancers, and then inject these cells back into the patient.
A trial of a vaccine in patients with various cancers has shown promising results.
When a woman was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize sickle cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein, known as HER2, that causes many cancers, and then inject these cells back into the patient.
Jay Bersowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results we have now indicate that we have a highly promising vaccine".
Prof. Berzowski explained that HER2 influences the growth of several types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating blood cancer.
After his presence at the SNL, Kanye West, wearing a huge hat, has been exposed to pro-Trump outrages.
But it's not that much of an Asian.
After an unrelated performance that praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020, Kanye West was called a cowboy during Saturday night's live show.
In a May America Great Hat, after singing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, he took a leap against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How do you like a racist Trump?'
Let me tell you, if I was concerned about race, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago, he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, who joked about Brett Kavanaugh's swearing-in before the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with the sexual assault rights raised by Christine Blaisey Ford.
Though not broadcast, footage of West's nonsense speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by posting this.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulty wearing a hat on the back.
"They scared me in the back.
They said, "Don't go in there wearing that hat".
They threatened me!
They say I'm in a drowning area", West said, reports the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the place where the water sank? Put on my Superman Cap because it means you can't tell me what to do", he said, "Do you want the world to move forward?"
"Try love".
Variety reported that audiences were amazed at his comments on at least two occasions by the members of the crew and the cast of the SNL, where one person told the publication: "The entire studio has fallen into mortal silence".
West is portrayed as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had recently died.
Many were surprised when West sang "I Love It" dressed as Perry Bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of conservative group TP USA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing out from the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that she was just like West, and it was amazing.
"But I will not decide to reward (or buy his music or clothes or support his 'art') someone who I believe is promoting and defrauding an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are too", they added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, tweeting that he was "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, West is following in the footsteps of Diddie, who was known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Piddie.
West's fellow rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion, while the musical legend Prince, who was formerly known as Prince, changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of murder in a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is invading the venomous masculinity
He is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor, who saw such roles on screen and said that young boys were going to believe that they needed a rough temper to be respected, broke into the stereotype of the macho hero.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, 31, admits that he "strongly" believes the issue needs to be addressed.
'I feel very strongly now, personally - where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he asked.
'What are we teaching our growing boys about the problem we are seeing now?'
Because of the many characters that masculinity is permeating in TV shows, Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: 'What is inherited and what is taught?
What is it that young boys are taught on TV and in the streets that they must have certain characteristics to be a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because something's wrong with the young people.'
He admitted in an interview that he will not be doing any prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and that he is "tired of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepherd's True West, a story about a filmmaker and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing about Game of Thrones is that he thinks he's met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so the show gave me a future family and a life to move forward", he said.
Rose played Yegrette, the mistress of Kit's character John Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China says that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, marking a shift from the past.
Traditionally, the rapid spread of HIV in parts of China was the result of blood transfusions, using blood from infected individuals.
However, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province that the number of HIV cases had been reduced in this way.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by over one million a year.
HIV transmission among LGBT communities in China is a serious problem.
China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people remains severe.
Studies suggest that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men will eventually marry women themselves due to the conservative values that remain in the country.
When men engage in sexual intercourse with each other, they often get sick because they do not receive adequate sexual protection.
As part of efforts to address this problem, since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV medicines universally available.
Maxina Waters has said that the data of her staff and GOP senators have not been leaked, that such allegations are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied Saturday that one of his employees posted the personal information of a Republican U.S. senator on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat emphasized that these are just claims made by "far-right" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, more degrading lies, Waters said in a tweeted statement.
Reports said that the leaked information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orin Hatch.
During the Senate panel's hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, an unknown person from Capital Hill posted the information online on Thursday.
The information was leaked online shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waterways office and that information about a member of the Waterways staff was released.
This baseless allegation is completely false, completely false, Waters continued.
As a result of these false and false allegations, there has been a compromise in the identity, personal information and security of one of my employees, but my employee is not responsible for the leakage of this information in any way.
This unfounded allegation is completely false, completely false.
Waters's online statement drew criticism from former White House press secretary Arie Fletcher, among others.
"There is an anger in this denial", wrote Fletcher.
This suggests that they do not have the passion to become a Congressman.
When someone accuses you of something you didn't do, you shouldn't be angry.
We must not be arrogant.
Do not question the intentions of the accuser.
The Bible teaches that "they are not to be provoked, but to be kind to one another".
Fletcher was trying to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said was seen in a very angry manner during the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to expel Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If true, big event, he tweeted.
The Office has informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these false claims, Waters said in a statement.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to light and that they are legally liable for all their actions that cause harm to my employees or any of my employees", they continued.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The Powerless Spice Puff by Rowan Atkinson
The Brexit emphasis is now a trend in any new British-influenced film, and it seems to apply to this second installment of the 'Johnny English' action-comedy spoof franchise - the franchise that began in 2003 with 'Johnny English' and was revived in 2011 with 'Johnny English Rebound'.
Will this self-deprecating self-deprecating question of how obviously stupid we are become the country's new export opportunity?
In any sense, the eye-popping, rubber-faced, unskilled Johnny English is licensed to fatten things up for a second time - his signaling name is above and beyond that he is an advanced comic created for non-English speaking, movie audience areas.
He is certainly a silly secret agent, and although he has odd pretensions to a well-mannered appearance, a powder of Mr. Beans's cheerleaders and a handful of cheerleaders of a young man who contributes a single note to the 'Chariot of Fire' theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics' opening ceremony have mixed him up to make him feel like Inspector Clausau.
He is actually based on the man, a traveler and a loyal citizen of mystery, who Atkinson himself once starred in a barclays TV commercial that no one remembers now.
This latest Johnny English release has one or two good moments.
I liked Johnny English, who was wearing medieval fencing, and the rotating blades sounded loud on the helmet for a while, and approached the helicopter.
Atkinson's ability to physically show humor is evident in the film, but the effects are not strong, and are oddly exaggerated, especially in an era when "respectful" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are now confidently adding comedy as an ingredient.
The humor in the film feels more for children than adults, and I never felt Johnny English's crazy adventures more innovative or concentrated than the silent film comedies starring Atkinson as Mr. Bean.
The film is about the permanent theme of Great Britain's current serious problem.
A cyber hacker breaks into Britain's super-secret web network and reveals the identities of all British agents working in the field of secret intelligence, which in turn frustrates the agent on duty - unfortunately, Kevin Eldon, who plays the agent, has only a small role.
This is the final teaser of a Prime Minister who is already politically popular and has a strong sense of pride and hatred for everything. Although Emma Thompson is doing well to portray this character like Theresa May, the truth is that she has nothing more to do with the script.
The Prime Minister's Intelligence Advisors have informed them that as the personal details of all spies active in the intelligence sector have been released, they should bring someone who is retired.
The man who is trying to be a disorganized Johnny English is looking to be a schoolmaster at some wealthy institution, but he's teaching off-the-record lessons on how to do 'undercover' activities: Here's some good fun stuff, and Johnny is teaching the School of Rock-type Academy English espionage.
English is brought back to White Hall for an emergency briefing and Ben Miller is reunited with his longtime teammate Bogg who has played again.
Bug is now married, and his wife is a submarine commander, and this "Jolie-Hockey-Stick" character has destroyed Vicky Pepperdine.
Batman and Robin are back in Her Majesty's Secret Service, and 'Poney' is about to begin, but things get messy when they have to face the beautiful, beautiful Olga Kuryenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously into the magic spell of a powerful tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: Jake Lacy portrays the cowardly billionaire Jason Volta.
English and Buff begin a parade of artificial copycats: they dress as waiters and set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle themselves abroad in Volta's luxury carriage; and John English throws things into total disarray as he tries to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
They've certainly put all their talent into this part of the film, but it's so subtle and fun, it looks like watching a little TV overall.
It's an average movie.
I still can't help but think of what I felt when I saw other Johnny English films: Couldn't the British film industry provide a character with the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
The Labour Party has denied the news that it is planning a plan to make the British work four days a week but pay five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a progressive plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but pay five days' wages.
Reports say that the party wants the profits generated by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to be transferred to the workers by the company's employers by giving them an extra day off.
If this happens, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend - but they can also buy the same old wages.
The news sources said that the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and the party is planning to tilt the country in favour of the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has adopted the idea of four days a week as a way to get the benefits of a changing economy for workers.
A senior Labour Party leader told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an ideal aspiration for the Party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers and as the overall industrial policy of the Party".
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse a four-day week, as the Green Party had promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently accepted by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The idea of a four-day work week is not Party policy and it is not considered by the Party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he has decided to take back power from the "faceless directors" and "profitable" of utilities.
Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in white companies may not get their full shares back because a Labour government could be charged 'discounts' based on perceived and observed wrongdoing.
He confirmed that there are plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 per cent of shares of private sector enterprises to employees.
Lyndon C. Graham and John Kennedy asked if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which delayed the final vote to nominate him to the Supreme Court by almost a week, has raised the question of whether the findings of the Bureau would prompt any Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes C" reporter Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if finding anything by the FBI would lead to their decision being changed.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
My answer is yes, John F. Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the trial, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, after the allegations came out, I called him and asked, 'Did you do this?'
He showed determination, determination and unwavering".
However, Graham's vote seemed to be cemented in stone.
"I've already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's just a guilt shot", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has bravely denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Balsey Ford.
No one who has mentioned their name has been able to confirm this.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I see no change in anything new".
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be hosted by New York City this Saturday, with attractive performances by celebrities at the annual music festival, as well as a remarkable mission to eradicate poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people have flocked to the Great Lawn of Central Park to attend the Global Citizen Festival not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shan Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Procurity Project, an international support group working to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To get a free ticket to attend the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), music concert lovers have to perform a number of jobs or "activities"; these activities include volunteering, emailing or calling a world leader, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But with only 12 years left to achieve the goal, how successful has Global Citizen been?
Is giving people a free concert ticket rewarding, a fundamental way to get people to respond to a call to action, or is "clictivism" - another form of useless activity where people think they are making a real difference by signing online complaints or tweeting - another form of what is called "clictivism"?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters to help a platform with different goals.
It says that these steps have helped to motivate world leaders to announce guarantees and policies worth more than $37 billion, aimed at moving the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the Group has selected 390 guarantees and announcements derived from its operations, distributed or funded at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the money they have raised has directly affected 649 million people worldwide so far.
One of the key assurances was that, following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, they were offered $35 million to help the country end Rwandan malnutrition. The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of committed investors and implementors, has offered the pledge to "help children grow up to their full potential".
With the support of the UK Government, donors and national governments, and global citizens like you, we can put a complete stop to the social injustice of malnutrition in history, Tracey Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live music event in London in April 2018.
After taking over 5,000 steps to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutrition.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is "Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long, hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the anti-racist movement that we have before us, we will succeed because we are stronger when we stand together.
This year's event in New York will feature artists such as Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shan Memphis, Cardi B, and Janelle Moni, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferns and Half Jackman.
US and Navy could be used as a "barrier" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Sinke has revealed that Washington could seek the Navy's help "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, the Washington-based Washington-Ton X Seminar reports.
Zinkhe accused Russia's involvement in Syria of being a ploy to find new markets, and it should be noted that Russia is intervening there at the invitation of the legitimate government in Syria.
I believe that they are intervening in the Middle East because they want to be a source of energy in the Middle East, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe, he said.
According to this official, there are ways and means to solve this.
With our Navy, the United States has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and kept open, and to block their energy if necessary, and ensure that it does not reach the market, he said.
Singe was addressing the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that in practice they are one and the same.
Describing Russia as a "one-stop-shop" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "The economic path over Iran and Russia is, in a way, to maximize fuel use and use one instead of the other".
The Trump administration is on a mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, excluding Russia, which will be a very inexpensive way for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Germany a "hostage" of Berlin and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a financial project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the plan is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be seen as a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moss Coil in September.
The US stance was met with a backlash from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading organization, has urged the United States to abstain from EU energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a headache for me when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has made a "firm decision" on her bid for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would make a "firm decision" on whether to run for president following the midterm elections.
They confirmed Warren would consider running for office at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and demand time for a woman to lead the government, they said, The Hill reports.
"After November 6, I will take the presidency seriously".
During the Town Hall, Warren reviewed him, saying that President Donald Trump was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"We need an FBI investigation before we can vote", Warren tweeted Friday.
However, according to a poll released on Thursday, a majority of people in Warren's own constituency are in favour of Warren not running in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters said they would not run for senator.
Thirty-two percent of the voters supported such a contest.
The poll found the most support for former Governor Devell Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting his run while 48 percent opposing.
Other top Democratic leaders who are being discussed as likely to run in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said the race will be officially decided in January.
Sarah Palin speaking at the Donald Trump rally about the PTSD of Track Milk
After joining the Army in September, Track Paline (26) spent over a year in Iraq.
Track Milk was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case on Monday night.
"When I think about what my own son is going through and what he went through when he came back, I can understand the plight of other families affected by PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers suffer when they return home", they said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paulin described her son's arrest as "the elephant in the room", saying that "they come back a little different, they come back hardhearted, they think, they wonder if the soldiers and airmen with them get any respect for what each member of the military has given to the country", she said of her son and others who have retired from the military.
He was arrested Monday from Wasilla, Alaska, charged with domestic violence against a woman, he had a gun when he assaulted her, and he was drunk, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge against the new U.S. policy of denial of asylum to victims of mass assault or domestic violence.
Representatives from 10 states and the District of Columbia filed a 'front-of-the-court brief' in Washington on Friday in support of the new policy and a person seeking asylum.
The full name of the plaintiff in the 'Grays versus Sessions' lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She claimed to have been abused by her partner and "children who were members of criminal gangs", but her request for asylum was denied by US officials on June 20.
They were detained in Texas.
Attorneys from states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries with widespread criminal gang attacks and domestic violence, and where large numbers of asylum seekers in the US come from.
In 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals repealed the U.S. Asylum Granting Policy, which allows undocumented immigrants who have escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rezin said the new law "is a continuing disregard for decades of state, federal, and international law".
The Federal Law mandates that all claims for damages be settled based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, but such a ban violates that principle, the Front-of-the-Court Brief claims.
The lawyers then argued briefly that the policy of denial of entry to immigrants is hurting the US economy and that asylum seekers are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing shelter to those fleeing attacks from criminal gangs and domestic violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to hunting or fear of leaving their home country due to race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in a policy announcement made on June 11.
And the purpose of providing shelter is never to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day -- even all the serious problems -- but to provide shelter.
Rescue operations were ordered in both Palau as the death toll in Patchil doubled.
For the survivors, the situation was even more dire.
"The stress is intense", said Reza Kusuma, 35, reassuring her fever-prone son at one of the evacuation centers in the troubled city of Palau.
Ambulances are bringing bodies every minute.
There is no fresh water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking their waterlogged supplies, and trying to move anything they could find to safe roads.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were destroyed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwy Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building due to continuous strong quakes.
When he remembered the earthquake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter, Dwayne Harris' eyes were filled with water.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I feel like I'm stuck in the walls, and I told the Associated Press that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then I didn't hear a sound.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe somewhere.
US Ambassador accuses China of threatening with 'campaign ads'
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily about the bilateral gains of US-China trade, the US ambassador in China alleged that Beijing used American media to spread China's propaganda.
After allegations that China is trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, the US president referred to the supplement provided by China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election was a new step in increasing the intensity of Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, relations between Beijing and Washington are caught in a growing trade war, with imports of goods from both countries increasing several times.
In the trade war, China had earlier increased imports in retaliation to the US, and economists in China and the US said the new tariffs were designed to target import entities in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa and owner of one of the largest agricultural exporters in China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now doubling the threat by publishing propaganda in our own free media", Brantz wrote in a comment column for the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
By placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the freedom of speech and press that is nurtured in the United States to spread propaganda, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newsstands here in the streets of Beijing, you can see limited voices of disagreement and you can't see the real reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic path, because the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also wrote that his article "has turned away from the promise of publishing one of China's leading newspapers", but he did not mention which newspaper.
As Kavanaugh remains a blind man, analysts say the Republican party will be out of control of women voters before the midterm elections.
As many leading Republican Party leaders, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has faced numerous sexual harassment, stand by and resist him, the Republican Party will face a setback during the upcoming midterm elections, a setback from the political analyst, especially women.
The sentiment around this is so high that most Republicans already see a desire to move forward with a vote.
These things never go back", wrote Grant Reehr, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reehr said he suspects Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute request for an FBI investigation is not enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow and November", said Karin Jean Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoWon, reported the Washington-Ton DC newspaper on Friday.
Despite the oath of office of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, and the decision of the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, protesters demonstrated in the Senate corridor on Friday morning, chanting "November is Coming!"
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democratic Party is about to be removed from the chart", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But there is still room for further growth, especially among the suburban voting women and young people aged 18 to 29, who don't like the president but don't vote often".
Even before Ford's public swearing-in to explain allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that a Republican's move forward with confirmation would be a blowback.
As reported by NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steel said last week that this has been troubling the GOP.
Guy Cessil, director of Priorities USA, the group that helps elect Democrats, said the news channel was not only about the committee's vote or final vote or whether he would be appointed to the Kavanaugh bench, but also about the way Republicans handled the allegations and how Republicans treated the two.
However, Americans seem to be divided on who to trust in the context of Ford and Kavanaugh's swearing-in roots, and they prefer to trust Kavanaugh a little bit.
A recent opinion poll by Yugav shows that 41 percent of people believe Ford's oath is final or has happened, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh is final or has happened.
In addition, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh lied about his oath, either for certain or for certain, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following a request from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least another criminal, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford swore an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh himself was under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that while attending a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed his own genitals.
The World Wide Web's founder is launching a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The company, called InRapt, is the latest project in the technology legend, and the project is built on solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and which information to allow access to which people.
In a separate interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind the introduction was to dominate the world.
"We need to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It will contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's a technology that allows Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be available in a single browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data store is that it is entirely user-friendly to decide which type of information can be accessed by which people.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
John Bruce, CEO of INREPT, said that the idea of INREPT is to be a company that provides the resources, processes and expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee and Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some on-staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on InReput's website.
Berners-Lee said he and the team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that will completely overwhelm all of their business models overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post published Saturday in the Media, Berners-Lee wrote, "The mission of the Inprint is to provide a commercial energy and an ecosystem to help preserve the integrity and quality of the newly built solid web".
In 1994, Berners-Lee evolved the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the net neutrality debate.
Although Intrastat is starting, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web, says Berners-Lee.

The only Church of England priest to receive the Victoria Cross for his service in World War I was commemorated by his countrymen 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehigh Court.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, and he never learned of the news that he had received the highest British military honour.
His two granddaughters unveiled the memorial stone at a parade on Saturday in Rushdon, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that unveiling the stone on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's award work was "a vivid symbolism".
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "through heavy snow and high-altitude cartridges from the field and machine guns".
He then jumped into the firing line, exhibiting "great gallantry", jumping alone into a field-gun line, leading his battalion forward and knocking down three of the enemy troops.
On October 4, 1918, a month before the war ended, Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper.
"I know I have not been able to live up to my grandfather's example of courage", said Michael Van, 72, "but it makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann presented the flower circle after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was very proud of his role in the parade and said that the support of many people shows the courage of a true hero.
MMA fans who slept through the night watching Bellator 206 had to settle for Peppa Pig.
Imagine what it would be like if you were to sleep through the night watching the crowded Bell 206, and you were denied this important event.
Bill from San Jose, 13 fights including six fights on the main card, will be shown live at night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, while Gegard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were fighting, the UK audience was shocked when the coverage shifted to Peppa Pig.
Those who waited until morning to enjoy the fight were disappointed.
A fan tweeted that the screen turned into a children's cartoon and became "a kind of dirty joke".
"Government restrictions have made it inappropriate for them to broadcast the content at 6 a.m. and they have had to switch to a children's program", said Dave Shartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, yeah".
In the future, the Bellator company's president Scott Cocker said, they will try to create a schedule that will include more UK audiences.
"When you think about Replay, I think we can solve this problem", said Cocker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't fix this until Sunday is our time and Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we changed coverage, there were a lot of text messages flying in and out, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, but we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We've broken down six fights into five -- as we usually do -- to sum it up, and I think we've given the audience more than they need.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daly says he felt 'abstract' about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up with the feeling that he was inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this inspired Daly to win.
"Not everyone is like me", the 24-year-old said, "and I didn't realize it until I went to high school".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he spoke about gay rights that give others "hope".
He said that being a parent has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
For a long time, the show's regular host, Kirsty Young, was on a leave of absence for several months due to illness.
While on Laverne's first program, Daly said that she felt "less" than others as she grew up because "the likes of boys and girls alike were not accepted by society".
He said: "The feeling of being inferior and different from others and the strength and strength to succeed have been the real things that have given me so far".
He said he wanted to prove he was "something" and so he was not disappointed when everyone finally found out about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, Daly has now become a major LGBT campaigner, using his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said he was openly saying this because he felt lucky to live in public without any negative consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
With a man, Dustin Lance Black, a US filmmaker he met in 2013, three-time world champion Dalí said that he was "surprised" by his falling in love.
He said that while Dalí married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him, age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much hardship at such a young age", he said - when Daly first competed in the Olympics at the age of 14 and Daly's father died of cancer three years later - it was difficult to meet someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs as him.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son, Robert Ray Black-Dale, which changed his "total outlook", Dale said.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have been talking about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's more to life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
In 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Daly adopted the same name as his late father, Robert.
Daly said his father never admitted that he was dying and the last time he asked if London 2012 tickets were still available was because he wanted to see him sitting in the front row.
"But I couldn't say 'I won't have a dad until I'm sitting in the front row,'" he said.
"I held his hand until he took his last breath, and I finally accepted that he was not invincible until he actually stopped breathing and died", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive a home country in front of a crowd at an Olympic Games, it was the best feeling I could have ever had", he said.
It also inspired his first song - Heather Sman's Pride - and it resonated with him until the Olympics, and he still gets excited when he hears this song.
The Desert Island Disc is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
The Ryder Cup Saturday didn't bring down Mickelson, who was not in great shape.
On Sunday, American Phil Mickelson will make history playing his 47th Ryder Cup race, but he will have to keep his form up to date to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
For the 12th time in history, Mickelson was released by captain Jim Furyk from the Forbes and Forms on Saturday.
Instead of being the only player to break the game, as he often did for America, he was a five-time major winner, and spent his days training on the racetrack, encouraging others and solving problems he had faced.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old, who was not accurate with his betting, was not fit for the tough Leigh National Golf Course.
Although the golf course is no longer as difficult, Mickelson will face up to the ninth match of Sunday's match to the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their races this week.
If the Americans below four points get off to a strong start in 12 singles matches, Mickelson's game will definitely be decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his player, not saying he could say anything else.
He has fully understood what his role will be today and he has knocked me out and said that he will be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a great player and he has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined he'd play two games.
I was more than expecting, but that's what happened.
He needs to go out and play, just like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldow's record for most Rider Cup games played.
He's nearing the end of a Ryder Cup career that won't match the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, however, Furyk said his presence brought much unforgettable to the team.
"He's funny, he's fiercely funny, he's funny, he likes to play people, and he's a great person to be on the team", Furyk said.
I think the young players had a taste for this week's match against him.
He'll offer more than just a game.
Captain Thomas John knows the big lead will soon disappear.
European captain Thomas John knows from experience that an unbroken lead leading to the final day of the Ryder Cup singles would then break down at any time.
Dane made his debut in a match at Valderama in 1997, where the team under the captaincy of Sev Ballesteros outscored the Americans by five points, but they came in a very slightly different finish line, winning by a margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You're reminding yourself that there's a big lead at Valderama; we had a big lead at the Brook Line where we lost, we won at Valderama, but it was just a win", John said, commenting on a session that saw John's team win the 2018 class at Le Golf International on Sunday with a 5-3 lead and a 10-6 lead yesterday.
So history has shown me and the rest of the team that this is not over.
You might be bored tomorrow.
Get out of that situation quickly and do all the right things.
Nothing stops until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that is what we are focused on.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players on my team, but we know who is on the other side - they are the best players in the world".
John, who was happy with his team's performance on the rugged golf course, added: "I can never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
The personal manifestations that are coming tomorrow are something different to do.
It's great to be on the course with a partner when things are going well, but if you're on the course alone, your ability as a golfer will be fully tested.
That's the message you have to send to the players, that tomorrow you get the best out of yourself.
Now, you're leaving your partner, and he's going to have to go and get the best out of him".
Unlike John, the opposite attitude is opposite to rival Jim Furyk, who asks the players to perform individually rather than as partners, with the only exception being Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Fury has seen both ends of this great sporting event taking place on the last day of the Angel, and Fury was part of the team that won the Brooklyn Line, which was defeated by Europe's elimination of the "Miracle in Medina".
For the final day, Ben Cran Shaw, captain of the 1999 team, was asked how he had lined up his players, and he replied, "I remember every inch of it".
"We have 12 big matches tomorrow, but as we saw at Brookline, you want to get a fast start like you saw at Medina.
When the speed goes the other way, there is a lot of pressure in the middle of the race.
And we've set the lineup, we've set the style of the players that we think is right, and you know, we're trying to get a magic out of tomorrow".
Thomas has been given the task of leading the relegation, and in the top match he will face Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pulter as the other Europeans coming in the first half of the order.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it's all inclusive in every way", John said of his singles choices.
The commissioning of the new German warship has been postponed again.
The newest warship of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old and Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, local media reported that it would not be commissioned until at least next year.
The commissioning of the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class battleship, the "Rhineland-Falls", has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the Die Seat daily reported, citing a military spokesman.
The Navy was supposed to have the ship in 2014, but the fate of the Pride Plan was adversely affected by the problems before delivery.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class battleships.
The ships are also known to have some classified technologies such as high-powered artillery, air-to-air, ship-to-ship missiles, radar, infrared and acoustic sights.
Another important feature is that long-term maintenance is not required, so new warships must be able to be deployed away from the ports of the mother country, for up to two years.
However, the Dy Seat notes that the continued delay in commissioning means that these warships with advanced technologies will be outdated by the time they enter service; these ships are said to have allowed Germany to show its strength in foreign countries.
The F125s, which were disastrously damaged, received media attention last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ships and sent them back to the Hamburg-based Blohm and Vos shipyard.
The ship was returned to the shipbuilder after delivery was delayed for the first time in the history of the Navy.
No one knows the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media report that the ship has several critical "software and hardware failures" and therefore is of no use to warships when deployed for war missions.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the new Baden-Württemberg-class battleships were controlled by a 120-man crew comprising only half of the sailors of the old Bremen-class battleships.
Furthermore, there have been reports that the ship is overweight and that overweight will reduce the performance of the ship and limit the ability of the Navy to innovate in the future.
The "Rhineland-Falls", weighing 7,000 tons, are believed to be twice the weight of ships of the same class used by the German carrier in World War II.
While the issue of faulty hardware is being put aside, the cost of the entire project - including training the crew - becomes a problem.
Although initially expected to cost €2.2 billion, it is now reported to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining, the issues affecting the latest warships are particularly important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "missing deployment-capable ships".
The officials said the problems were complicated by decommissioning old ships but not getting new ones for the new generation.
He expressed regret that none of the new Baden-Württemberg-class battleships have been of any use to the Navy.
The National Trust is monitoring the secret lives of the whales.
A new study is being conducted at an estate in the Highlands of Scotland to understand how whales use landscapes to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to be useful in gaining new knowledge about the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future whaling conservation activities.
In the Inverereve Gardens in West Rose, the study will be conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scottish Lundy to observe the common, soprano, pipistrell's and brown long-eared dowbenton whales.
Special recorders will be installed in key locations around the estate to track the activities of the whales throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will conduct the mobile survey using handheld detectors.
A sophisticated sound analysis of all recordings will help determine the frequency of wavelengths and determine which wavelength species makes the sound.
A biomechanical map and report will then be prepared to create a landscape-wide picture of the behavior of whales.
Rob Dever, NTS's Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results of the survey will reveal which areas of the ecosystem are most important to whales and how each of the whales species uses them.
For whales and other related species, this information will help to determine the benefits of ecosystem conservation activities such as grassland creation and best management of forests.
Over the last century, the number of whales across Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
The waves are threatened by buildings, development activities and habitat destruction that affect nesting areas.
Wind turbines, electric light, fly paper, chemical treatment of construction materials, and attacks from pet cats are all threats to whales.
The whales are not actually blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use highly complex eco-location techniques to accurately identify insects and obstacles along the flight path.
The NTS Wawalas are highly respected and responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
The institute has 10 trained specialists who conduct regular surveys, rigorous tests and sometimes rescue lives.
The organisation has opened the first dedicated walnut sanctuary in Scotland on the Treva estate in Dumfries, and the sanctuary, called Galloway, is home to eight of the Scottish walnut species found in Scotland.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is a model area for the whales.
"There is a place for waves here in Trieste", he said.
"There are old buildings, many large trees, and a good environment.
But there is still much unknown about whales, so what we are doing here and in other estates will help us to understand more about what is needed to keep whales healthy".
He emphasizes the importance of checking the waves before repairing buildings, as accidental destruction of a single moth can kill 400 female and child waves, and sometimes the entire area of waves can be eliminated.
Here, the whales are protected, and it is illegal to kill, harm, disturb or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has appealed to the public to provide the necessary assistance.
They said: "We still have much to learn about our whales, we don't know how many whales are there and how well they are growing".
Ronaldo denies the allegations of abuse by the German magazine, and lawyers seek compensation from the magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of abuse against him were "fake news" and that people were using his name to "build a reputation for themselves".
His lawyers are preparing to take the case to court against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
In 2009, in a Las Vegas hotel room, an American girl named Kathryn Mayorga was allegedly raped by Ronaldo after playing forwards for Portugal and Juventus.
Ronaldo allegedly paid the young woman $375,000 to keep the incident from being reported, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers in a live Instagram video hours after the allegations were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo has called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
"They're fake news today", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in a live stream.
"They want to make a name for themselves with my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm happy, it's all right, and I added a smile.
In connection with the allegations, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a defamation suit against him, which, according to Reuters, was an unauthorized reporting of privacy concerns.
Christian Shirtz, the star's lawyer, said that the star will seek compensation for "moral damages that are as serious as breach of the law", adding that "in recent times, this is one of the most serious violations of personal rights".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorta returned to the star's room after meeting at the nightclub, where Ronaldo was able to deliver the vows to Mayorta.
After the alleged incident, Mayorca claims that Ronaldo kneeled before him and said that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but cheated on "one percent".
Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but the documents claim that it was by mutual consent.
Mayorka claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "revenge would be frightening" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old said that the alleged incident was still being tarnished by the lawsuit by cancelling the settlement.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United to join Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and was transferred to Italian giant Juventus for a $100 million fee this summer.
Brexit: UK will 'regret forever' for the loss of carmakers
After Brexit, the UK's Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark, said he would regret losing the world's top car manufacturer status.
He added that Toyota UK was "concerned" to have told the BBC that production at the plant in Bernaston near Derby would be suspended if the UK left the EU without a deal.
We need a deal, Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that if no deal is to be made, jobs will be lost due to the impact of delays on the country's borders.
Toyota's Burnaston plant, which makes Oris and Avensis, produced 1,50,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Bernaston.
In connection with the UK's withdrawal from the EU without a deal, other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have also raised concerns about how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW says the mini plant in Oxford will be closed for a month following Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the main concerns expressed by car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line is based on the timing of the delivery of components, which are delivered to Toyota every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union.
On March 29, the industry said that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there could be a disruption to the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of components.
The company said it was impossible to store more inventory than was available at Toyota's Derbyshire plant for a day, so production would have to be halted.
"Theresa May's Checks Plan for the future relationship with the European Union is precisely planned to avoid such checks on the border", Clark said.
"We need an understanding. We want to have a better understanding that will allow us to not only enjoy the current success but also take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is reminiscent that we have had a highly successful supply chain, and we must certainly be able to keep it that way".
While Toyota did not say how long the construction would be halted, the company warned that in the long run, the extra cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and result in job losses.
Peter Suvalris, a unit union conveyor at the plant who has been working at Barnstone for 24 years, said his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs go, they will never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
The White House has warned that Trump's meeting with Rosen Stein may be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday that the important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be delayed by a week as the Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues to be in contention.
Rosenstein oversees the activities of Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel investigating Russian election interference, Trump supporters' ties to Russia, and presidential interference in the justice system.
For months, Washington has been fueling rumors about whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus undermine Mueller's independence.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein discussed the use of a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosen Stein denied the report.
Despite the news that he was retiring from office, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that he would meet with Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't care" to fire Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid it during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blessey Ford, one of the women who alleged he had been sexually abused, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, delaying the entire Senate vote again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date has not been set, and it is likely to be this week, and I think it may be postponed for another week given all the other things in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I'm always interested in bringing news to the media".
Some reporters will question that statement, saying Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV reporters' "crowd-friendly" anger, but they stated: "I do not disagree with the fact that they come in groups".
They also suggested that the media and Trump will have more direct contact afterwards.
"The president is conducting more question and answer sessions than his predecessors", he said.
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, "If the media gets the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it many times over the last few weeks, and you've seen us do it many times over the last few weeks, and now instead of holding a press conference, you're going to speak directly to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House or attending open sessions, either regularly or during press conferences with high-profile figures.
It is rare to conduct press conferences alone.
This week, in New York, he demonstrated why, and freely but strangely appeared before more reporters.
The Secretary of Health is writing to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the EU workers working in Scotland's NHS to express their country's gratitude and their desire to continue after Brexit.
With less than six months to go before the UK leaves the European Union, Sean Freeman MSP has sent a letter.
The Scottish Government has already offered to bear the cost of residence status applications for EU citizens working in the field of transferred public services.
In the letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In addition to the summer, negotiations on a compromise withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and the expected decisions may be made this autumn.
But Britain has begun preparations for a no-deal situation.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
The invaluable experience and skills of colleagues from across the European Union and beyond have played a major role in strengthening and improving healthcare activities, thereby benefiting patients and society.
Scotland is your home ground, and we want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who suffered an injury to his head following a loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, 31-27, was reportedly undergoing emergency surgery by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
He was injured just before midnight, Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters.
"He got to the side line and got lost", Reed said.
On the side line, the trainers and medical professionals gave Abercrombie oxygen and put him in a tractor, then took him for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris of the completion of Abercrombie's surgery from Vanderbilt Medical Center at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee.
"There is no information available on the extent and/or extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the accident occurred, he said.
This was the first season for Tennessee State since the redshirt sophomore, Abercrombie, left Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before the end of Saturday's game, including a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreigners who come to the UK and buy goods will have to pay a high stamp duty.
Foreigners will have to pay a high stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under Tory plans.
This move will derail the move of COB to attract young voters.
In the UK, there will be higher stamp duty on non-payers.
The Treasury expects this to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreigners will have to pay a high stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corb's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting higher incomes.
The stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and entities in the UK, and the extra money will be reinforced by the government's move to provide housing for the homeless.
The surcharge - in addition to the current stamp duty, imposed on second homes and rental homes two years ago - can be as high as 3 percent.
The Treasury aims to raise up to £120 million a year.
13% of newly built London properties are bought outside the UK, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing sector.
Many of the country's affluent areas - especially the capital - have become "ghost cities" because a good percentage of foreign buyers spend more time outside the country.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the property of being soaring in price because large construction companies own land but do not use it and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr. Corbin has announced an impressive series of specific housing reforms, including rental restrictions and an end to evictions of "non-displaced persons".
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restore the British dream, to make life better for every new generation.
It means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for non-British residents and foreign companies to be able to buy homes as easily as hardworking British residents.
The dream of having a home of their own is far from being realized for many people, and the shame of not having a good place to sleep remains a reality".
Jack Rose: 'My ultimate wish is to rule Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Rose says his "ultimate ambition" is to rule Scotland at some point.
The challenge of reviving the North-East is currently facing the 42-year-old Scott, who is currently third in League One.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"My ambition as a player is to play for my country.
I got a B-cap, and that's what Rose told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But when I was a kid, I grew up with my dad and I went to Scotland in Hampden, and it was always something that kept me behind.
But I will only get that chance if I succeed in running the club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poynte and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa it Lattic boss says he has no qualms about being the successor to established names in such big clubs. He had previously turned down offers from Banshee and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the measure of success now is the question of whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
The structure and facilities of this club make it undoubtedly in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get it there, but I'll see that I've won here when I can get this club back there".
For his 15 months as assistant manager at Dumbarton and on the coaching staff at Hart's, Ross has spent only three years of his managerial career.
He later helped Alloa rise from defeat to the third tier, and saved St Mirren from defeat and made them the championship title winners the following season.
Ross says that he is happier than his sports career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It may have been a real turning point", he says, taking over the role of Lyoya.
"I honestly believed that management was more important to me than playing.
It may sound strange, but I've earned enough to live without any hassle to get to some heights.
But it can be hard to play.
You're gonna have to go through a lot every week.
I still have my job problems and pressures, but I feel very good about management.
I always wanted to be in management, and now I am. I am happy to be doing what I love at my age".

The pressure on the restaurant chain has increased as the extreme summer heat has spurred the loss of pubs in the UK.
The figures indicate that in July, sales were up 2.7 per cent in pubs and bars, while in restaurants, they were down 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA of Business Consultancy, compiled the figures, saying: "England's continued summer and long-term World Cup participation in June and July were a pattern in pubs, which were a continuation of the previous year's World Cup.
The restaurant sector experienced a decline of 1.8 per cent in June, which was lower than in July.
When drinking-led pubs and bars were more active than in previous years, restaurants were falling.
Food-led pubs also suffered from summer cuts, but it wasn't as bad as restaurants.
People should think that everyone is going out for a drink.
The sales of drinks in bars and pubs across the country increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while the food decreased by 3 per cent".
Paul Newman, an analyst at Lisher and Hospitality at RSM, says: "These results from late April are still coming.
The major factors influencing sales in the markets are the weather and social sports events.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups are concerned about this, although a year-on-year decline in sales of 4.8% is also part of the ongoing price pressure.
The long summer is the biggest impact for food-led operators, and we will have to wait and see if the relatively mild weather in August provides temporary relief".
The overall growth of 2.7 percent in July, including new openings in the pub and restaurant sectors, actually reflects a recession in brand outlets.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales monitor for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and reviews the operating data of 47 operating groups with a turnover of £9 billion, a benchmark in the sector.
One in five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One survey found that one in five children - even those 11 years of age - may have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake insta" pages.
This news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the children said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - even those who are only 11 years old - has social media accounts and hides them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Nearly 20 percent of these students say they have a clean "main" account and confidential personal accounts to show their parents.
A mother who had accessed the secret site of her only 13-year-old teenage daughter was silent when she saw a teenage girl calling out to others, "Rape yourself".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18 year olds had 2 profiles, half of whom kept confidential accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Bucknan said: "It is an unfortunate fact that teens are trying to build online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Scottish it's on the latex board "It'll be the sound for the late" by Elide Doyle
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish ITL Board as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Council.
The most famous track and field event in Scotland is the Doyle. Chairman Ian Beatty said that this is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from the vast experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Elid is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we believe bringing them on board will greatly benefit Scotland's athletics", added Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am very excited to be the voice for athletes and I believe I can make my own contributions and help lead Scotland's sport".
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and is now a permanent BBC pundit, lost his mobility due to a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "One month ago on this day I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time can tell when and how much he will recover.
It was a very difficult time, but I'm completely healed. I've learned to walk again. I can now exercise diligently!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising that likened mothers to cows has led to controversial online comments
The advertisement for breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows has led to various comments online.
In order to launch the product, consumer tech company LV announced a fun music video featuring the new pump's facilities for mothers.
It shows four aunts dancing to this music in a place where the cattle are holding their horns. The lyrics are: "Yes, I'm breastfeeding, but you can't see the tail".
And then the chorus says, "Pump, pump, I give it to the kids. Pump, pump, I'm breastfeeding you guys".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
The video, which has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has received mixed reactions from critics, many of whom are talking about the dairy industry's "insides".
"The use of cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they are also breastfeeding and breastfeeding their babies, except that within days of their birth, their babies are removed from their homes", one observed.
The LV breast pump can be placed very well inside a nursing bra.
Another commented: "It is difficult for both mother and child to understand that the child is just as difficult to understand.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for breastfeeding mothers?"
Another added: "Remorseless advertising".
Others favored the ad, with one woman saying the song was "fun".
"I think this is a good idea.
If I'd been breastfeeding now, I would have.
I felt like a cow when I pumped.
This ad is a little out of date, but I'm taking it as it is.
It's a good product", someone said.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad for "laxmium" for mothers (sometimes at work and on toy leats) who look like "pumping, cows".
This is not a compliment or criticism of the dairy industry".
The women dancing at the end of the video reveal that they all had pumps in their braces.
The idea behind this campaign is that breast-pumping women look like cows.
However, the LV pump is certainly convenient, with no wires or tubes and is properly fixed within the nursing brake, giving women the freedom to walk, pick up the children and go outside while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Mother's partner and ECD, says: "The LV pump is certainly a revolutionary product that requires a bold start.
We have tried to highlight the disadvantages of breast pumping and its associated disadvantages by comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows, and to show the freedom of breast pumping in a very interesting and engaging way.
This is not the first time that LV Pump has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, this product was used by model, mother of two, to catwalk designer Martha Jacbauski.
Hundreds of migrant children were moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
The number of children who cross the border monthly has remained unchanged, and the number of children who are prohibited immigrants has increased significantly because some of the Trump administration's tough policies make it difficult for children to be adopted through sponsors.
Many traditional sponsors become undocumented immigrants and put their own status at risk if they come forward to take responsibility for a child.
The risk was increased in June when federal authorities, sponsors and their adult household members were asked to submit their fingerprints and share that information with the Immigration Authority.
Matthew Albers, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, explained to Congress that about a dozen people were arrested last week for sponsoring undocumented minors.
The agency confirmed that nearly 70 per cent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"About 80 per cent of the sponsors or their families are illegal immigrants in the country, and a large part of them have a criminal background.
So we were just trying to get them out", Mr. Albers said.
To resolve the children's case quickly, the authorities had implemented new rules that required them to appear in court within a month of their detention.
Instead of appearing directly to the Immigration Judge for their application for legality, more people are making conference calls.
The unqualified will be expelled from the country soon.
According to the situation over the next few months, as stated and reported by shelter workers, more time spent in detention can lead to anxiety and depression, which can lead to negative perceptions and attempts to escape.
Advocates say that these concerns are more likely to be raised because children who are struggling in large facilities like Tornillo are more likely to be neglected.
They said that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare mentally or even say goodbye to their friends only increases their experience.
Syria is demanding an immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish troops.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Home Minister Walid al-Ma'ullam urged Syrian refugees to return to their homes at a time when the country's war is entering its eighth year.
Maulaam, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil in the name of fighting terrorism and that they will "manage them as they please".
"They should withdraw immediately without any conditions", he said in the General Assembly.
The Maul emphasized that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 3,60,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, is almost over.
He said that this holy struggle will continue in Damascus until "illegal foreigners and terrorist groups" are removed from all Syrian territories.
There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria who are training and advising the Syrian Arabs and Kurdish forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this belligerent country.
Maullam said that it is time for them to return to the refugee situation, accusing some Western countries of "spreading unrealistic fears" and keeping refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and human rights organisations to facilitate their return", he said.
"They are politicizing a human rights issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide aid to Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the construction of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has provided an opportunity for political negotiations to move forward, UN diplomats said.
The Russian-Turkish pact avoided a major attack on the area where three million people live by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Maul stressed that the treaty has a "timeline" and expressed hope that the fighters, including the Nusra Front jihadists affiliated with Al-Qaeda, would be targeted by the military and "displaced".
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura said the first meeting of a new committee of ruling and opposition members is expected to be convened to pave the way for the drafting and election of the post-war Syrian constitution.
The Committee was set up with the sole objective of government participation and said that the function of the panel should be to "review the provisions of the existing Constitution".
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to that logic, as many liberal thinkers expect, Trump could win the 2020 election if impeachment corruption does not end his administration.
If so, it will undoubtedly be the most dramatic final bid for the presidency.

Since 2014, Prime Time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to 10.5 target and reached 16 target on MSNBC.
Nielsen said that prime time viewership has grown from 1.7 million to an average of 2.4 million viewers four years before Fox News. She also leads the cable ratings with about 35 million readers on MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show".

Of course, more than anything on TV, the future of Rowe will be determined by the stories from Washington, whether it's the reunification of immigrant families or the health of the global economy.
Tuning out is a luxury, and only the most influential viewers can afford it.
Yet, about Bob Woodward using "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar camel-leather bomber jacket (a shirt painted with pride", the Washington Post said), and about Mr. Trump's "corporeal makeup", you're going to the back of a wise citizen when you watch a panel of experts give a six-hour interview about the clues to Stomi Daniel's horrific narrative.

The hard-line midterm elections are running for the House of Representatives.
It's no wonder that the 17th Pennsylvania has a cash flow crisis, caused by the reorganization of congressional districts that have brought two officers into the same race for office.
Recently, the boundaries were redefined, and the seat was taken up by the Pittsburgh Democrat, Connor Lamp, who won a special election in another district last spring.
Lamb is running against another Republican representative, Keith Rothfuss, who is now representing the 12th District of old Pennsylvania, which has now moved to the 17th District.
The boundaries of the old districts were changed by the Supreme Court ruling in January last year that they were wrongly shown to be unconstitutional for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th contest marked the beginning of a financial rivalry between the major financial parties, The Democratic Caucus Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
After winning a narrow majority in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, Lamp became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat has been held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scholars have given the Democrats a small chance of success.
The United States has considered imposing fines on El Salvador for its support to China, but has since withdrawn.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama have supported Beijing without any significant dissatisfaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump and President Juan Carlos Varela met in Panama for a friendly meeting. Trump owned a hotel in Panama, but its partners fired the management team of Trump's establishment.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions that they would no longer recognize Tai Wan, Department spokesman Heather Novart said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the fines were only applied against El Salvador, which received US$140 million in 2017 including drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed cuts in economic benefits and fines, including visa restrictions, are expected to plague Central American countries, causing unemployment and murder rates to rise.
As domestic meetings were progressing, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level meeting to review the progress of high-level discussions on security and economic prosperity, such as last year, which they believe will be a step towards efforts to contain migration.
Senior officials have called for the conference to be postponed until mid-September, which will also help address the fines imposed on El Salvador.
Deputy Prime Minister Mike Pence, who was tasked with convening the conference, said that the meeting was postponed to mid-October to include senior officials in the administration sector.
In addition, three U.S. delegates have returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or sanctions.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the discussions, including those of three US officials who had vowed to discuss the uncertainty of the domestic situation in the United States, including diplomats.
An outside analyst who is very close to the administration for this reason has confirmed their arguments and talked about uncertainties.
The history of learning
The next major event is the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who could be the key evidence in public records of Trump's injustice.
Muller knows that he is expanding his investigation into whether Trump's campaign has been engaged in violence with Russia in our election.
Is it likely that if Trump and a jury of his peers take responsibility at that meeting, as they are prepared to go to the polls again, Congress will not take responsibility?
Is it likely that the Congress will not take responsibility if Trump and a jury of his peers at that meeting assume responsibility as they are prepared to go before the voters again?

In 1938, German officials were preparing a coup d'état in Munich, which would only defend the western provinces and support the Czechoslovaks.
We have finally lost the opportunity to end years of suffering and have failed.
The course of history itself is based on such turning points, and they increase or decrease the pace of the difficult journey of democracy.
Americans have faced many of these turning points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenthal, who is setting the course for Muller's investigation?
Rosentine was in trouble last year after secretly monitoring the president and deeming him unfit for office.
Rosentine says the Times' explanation is not accurate.
"If the FBI investigation report on the newly requested Brett Kavanaugh is not complete and fair, or sexual assault and untrustworthy statements are made, how will we respond if he is elected to the Supreme Court?"
And besides, if we vote for Congress in the interim, will Trump be held accountable?
If we fail these tests, will democracy survive through the winter?
I believe that based on the lessons I learned from Paraguay, we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz during the Nazi regime that once existed in my embassy home.
They survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, they sent me to light candles on the Sabbath on tables with a stable.

Graham Torrance of the Ranger expressed optimism in the conflict with Rapid Vienna.
The victory over the Austrians earlier this month and then the impressive match against the Villiers in Spain will put them in the strongest position to qualify for the Europa League Group G, where the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
With his season coming up to 2-2 with Willerell, midfielder Graham Torrance has yet to make his debut due to a knee injury but he believes that the Rangers can work wonders on the springboard with the result.
"We are well-off that Willar is in good condition", said the 31-year-old.
"When we go out and play, we come back with points, believing we can do something.
This may be the last time we'll look at this closely, but it will have a positive effect.
They may have played better in the first half, but we came back better in the second half.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We can expect to get three points, but this is a tough game because they have good results from the previous games, but I believe with the support of our people we can do this and we can get a positive result.
Last year was a tough one because of my injuries and the changes at the club, but now I'm relieved.
The squad is very good and the players are enjoying the game, the training is very good.
I hope we can leave the past season behind and move forward and win".
Women lose sleep because of the fear of saving in retirement.
Although many survey respondents had differing views on how they should be protected, few had to talk to their family members about it.
In a nationwide survey, half of the participants were told to talk to their partner about the money they need for long-term care.
Only 10% of children talk about it.
Everyone needs someone in their family to protect them, but many are not even prepared to take the steps to talk about it", said Holly Cinder, vice president of the International Life Insurance Business.
This is where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children together If you do not have your wishes in mind, you may not be able to provide the care you want for your family.
Discuss with your counselor and family to make sure where and how much care you are receiving.
Bring your financial advisor in the field: Your advisor can help by providing advice on how to manage such expenses.
You can either have a policy that ensures traditional long-term conservation of your interest in saving money for this, or a hybrid cash value life insurance policy that covers such costs, or self insurance with your own savings - as long as you have money.
Find a solution to your litigation: Win legal battles.
In addition, you can also help to ensure that professionals are acting in accordance with your wishes even if you may not be able to communicate with them.
And find an heir for your wealth.
When you are unable to do so, you can ask the most trusted person to make financial decisions for you and pay your bills.
Don't forget the details: Suppose your elderly parent is in urgent need of medical attention and on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies at that time?
Include this information in a written plan and make sure that you are prepared.

In Afrcombe, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
The man who was returning home from a night trip was shot several times with an air rifle.
The 40-year-old was in Devon near Oxford Grove, Ephracombe, when he was shot in the chest, lower abdomen and hand.
The official said the shooting at 02:30 BST was a "single incident".
The shooter didn't see the assailant.
His wounds are not fatal and police have requested witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and the death toll is likely to rise.
The emergency services have said that no information has been received as all communication channels were disrupted in Dongglai Region, North Palau, close to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were displaced in Pallu as a result of the earthquake.
Here are some facts about the provinces of Pallu and Dongla, in the province of Sulawesi, Ireland.
Palau, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, is a very narrow seafront located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Its estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Tonggala Regency is located on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island, covering an area of 300 km (180 mi).
The region is a sub-provincial administrative region with a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Tongalla.
Nickel mining is also very important in this province but it is concentrated in the more Silvasi opposite Morovaly.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, in the last 100 years, several times the area of Palau and Tonggala have been hit by tsunamis.
More than 200 people died in the 1938 tsunami in Tongalla and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The 1996 tsunami that struck the western province of Tonga killed nine people.
Located in the geographic Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is a regular earthquake victim.
Here are some of the most important recent earthquakes and tsunamis.
2004: A major earthquake in the Ike province of North Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26 affected 14 Indian Ocean coastal countries and killed 226,000 people, more than half of whom were in Ike.
2005: 2005: A series of strong earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 on Indonesia's most densely populated island of Java caused a tsunami that devastated the entire southern coast and killed about 700 people.
The earthquake, which was felt in 2009 at a magnitude of 7.6, was felt in the city of Patang, the capital of North Sumatra Province.
About 1,100 people died.
In 2010, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing tsunami waves at a height of 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
The 2016 earthquake in Ike Province caused extensive damage, and caused a great deal of panic among the people, including the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
But this time, it wasn't the tsunami, and I've lost 100 people to the buildings that were destroyed.
In 2018, the massive earthquake on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok killed more than 500 people, most of them from the northern part of the island.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings to collapse and thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palente's eldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palinte's eldest son, Trac Milne, has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
According to a report by the Alaska State Troops on Saturday, Pauline, 29, of Kyle Vasalia, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, interference in domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he also stole the phone from the young woman who tried to inform the police of the alleged crimes.
According to KTUU, the milk held in an unsafe bond of $500 was recalled from another Su-Patrial facility.
When he appeared in court on Saturday and asked to apologize, he replied, "Certainly not guilty", news outlets reported.
Milk faces three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He was charged with a Class B felony, which carries a one-day jail term, a $2,000 fine and a fine.
This isn't the first time Milk has been charged with criminal offences.
He was arrested by police in December 2017 for harassing his father, Todd Milk.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the incident to the police.
This case is pending in the Alaska-Cale Veterans Court.
He was charged with domestic assault, interference in reporting of domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident in January 2016.
His girlfriend also complained of being hit in the face.
In 2016, the veteran group Sara Pal was criticized for his role in the PSTD being interrupted by his son's abuses.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
On Friday, 384 people were killed in an earthquake on Sulawesi, an Indonesian island.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes
The decline in electrical communication networks is likely to increase the mortality rate in the coming days.
The quake was felt in Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos of the impact of the incident have gone viral on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered on the coast as the tsunami approached the coastline for the beach festival in the city of Pallu.
Federal prosecutors have called for a rare death sentence for the NYC terrorist attack.
New York City attorneys are demanding that the defendant in the NYC terrorist attack that killed eight people, Sayfullo Saypo, be given the rare death sentence the state has not carried out for federal crimes since 1953.
In October, a 30-year-old Cypow assault on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan with a home depot rental truck resulted in the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to the notice of the Southern District of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, lawyers must prove that Sipov killed eight people "intentionally" and inflicted "intentional" serious physical harm.
Both charges are punishable by death under the law.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sippo on 22 counts, including eight counts of aiding and abetting robbery, which federal prosecutors use for ordinary organized crime, and assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The prosecutors said the method of the crime was "depraved, cruel and unjust" and that "accurate planning and planning" were needed to carry out such an attack.
"Seifulo Habíbulávíc Saypov has injured and damaged the family and friends of Diego N. Angellini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Lora Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Her Nan Ferrucci, Her Nan Diego Mendoza and Alajan Doro Damian Pagnuko", the Notes of the United States said.
Five of the people involved were Argentines.
A decade later, the Southern District of New York is executing a case.
Khalid Barnes, who was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, was sentenced to life in prison without parole in September 2009.
The last couple executed in a New York federal case was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, who were convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court records, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has not expressed any regrets after days and months of the attack.
Police said he told investigators he was only happy with his job.
Saypov told the authorities that the attack was inspired by watching ISIS videos on the phone.
Police said he also ordered the ISIS flag to be raised in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
Federal defense attorney David Patton, who appeared for Cypo, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty without life without the possibility of release from prison will only increase the psychological impact of all those involved", Patna said.
Saipov's defence had already begged the lawyers not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP said Nigel Faraj should be in charge of Brexit consultations
Nigel Farrah had vowed to "line up the People's Army" in protest at the Tory Conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians "want to know the heat" from the Eurosceptic - one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he be in charge of consultations with Europe.
Peter Bon, the real backbencher, said in March in Birmingham that if the UK had been Brexit Secretary, it would have 'gone out' by now.
The Tories underlined the challenges May faces in aligning her divided ranks by joining the city's special protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to protect their checkered compromise plan from attacks by the Brexit sitters, Rimee workers and the EU.
The Allies argued that they would go ahead with the deal with Brussels without regard to the setbacks they faced - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their promise and their 'problems'.
Bon said he wanted to 'eject the checks' at the Leve Means Leve rally inside Solih.
He suggested that Mr Farage be made an equal person and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Checker's'
He expressed his opposition to the European Union, saying that we are not in the grip of world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bonn has denied claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election. The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to continue is completely false.
Tory Breaker Andrea Jenkins was also present at the march, and she told the media that I'm just saying:
The Chechers are not well known in the public, and the opposition is not going to vote for them, and they are not popular with the activists who have overtaken us and our party, who have elected us to the top spot.
Please drop the cheaters and start listening.
In her message for Miss May, she added: 'The Prime Minister can only keep his position as long as he keeps his promises.
If you stand by the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, the rally politicians should be made to 'feel hot', Farage said.
'This is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our ruling class,' he said.
'They're trying to cheat Brexit, but we're here today to tell them that we won't let you do that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to 'feel warm' our political class in the autumn of betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilizing the People's Army of this country which has given us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we become independent, autonomous and United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remembrances marched to Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group started over the weekend, a little bit of wisdom from Tories activists was roaring against Brexit banners.
After the start of the Lord Adonis Conference from the Labour Party, the Conservatives' Party has mocked the security concerns facing the app.
These people are the ones who tell us that IT systems are right and that Canada Plus Plus has all the technology, frictionless borders, unrestricted free market in Ireland.
This is a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to watch the presidential election closely.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully analyze her candidacy for the presidency after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall in West Massachusetts Sex on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running against GOP State Representative Geoff DeHalle in the November re-election. DeHalle was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
They're in the middle of speculation about whether he'll take over from Trump in 2020.
The 36th meeting of the constituent members in the Town Hall format since taking office was held in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon.
One of the participants asked if they were running for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to the washing machine to repair their broken regime, and that one more woman would be on top of it.
Confirmed arrest in connection with the shooting death of Sims of LSU.
Baton Rouge police said Saturday they arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said the 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. ET.
They released video footage of the shooting on Friday night asking for help identifying the person in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wide Sims had a gunshot wound to the head, which is the cause of death", Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247 Sports.
Word came out to defend his friend and Simpson was shooting.
Simpson, who was armed, was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and to having been shot by Wade Simpson.
Without significant problems, Simpson was arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6-inch junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, including 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton has closed the World Championship after the team handed over the order to defeat Sebastian Vettel.
From that moment on, it became clear that Valterie Botts had qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday in a race where Mercedes' team orders played a big role.
Bottas had a good start in the poll and defending his position in the first two laps, inviting the home side to attack fellow teammates put Hamilton in a bad position.
It was crucial that the house moved to Pittsburgh first and let Hamilton drive in the back of the bus.
Earlier, Mercedes came in behind the wheel with a lap, but Hamilton went ahead after the wheel-to-wheel action and cut the Ferrari driver who avoided the risk of being caught unconscious after the double-movie to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Worsteppen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his twenty-first birthday.
After a quick finish, he held onto the tires and finished fourth behind Kimi Rake after taking the lead for much of the race.
He last reached the pitch on lap 44 and was unable to improve on the eight lap lap lap, as Raikon finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Walter was doing so well and the gentleman who asked me to let him.
The team did an impossible job of resisting", Hamilton said.
It was definitely rude body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein's argument that the letter written by Christy Blaise Ford did not leak alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Cabanok had sexually assaulted herself at a rally on Saturday.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president said nothing about the letter directly from Ford was made before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but that what was going on in the Senate was "revealing to people how selfish, unfaithful and bad they are".
"The beautiful things that are happening in the Senate right now are likely to happen when you see people who are angry and selfish and bad-tempered and disloyal", he said.
If the news leaks, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diane Fine Stein, did you leak?
Remember their answer -- you leaked the document -- "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't leak it".
Oh, wait a minute.
"We're not leaking", he added, mimicking the senator's facial expression.
The letter explaining Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent in July by Fein Stein and leaked in early September - but Fein Stein denied it was leaked from his office.
"I have not tried to hide Dr. Ford's allegations, and I have not left their story out", said Feinstein to a committee, The Hill reported.
They asked me to keep it a secret, so I did.
But the president was not comfortable with their protest, and he said at a rally on Saturday night that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe they didn't, but they showed a body language on the surface that they never saw".
The president said the Democrats may be making accusations from their side even as they continue to argue in defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women.
"They have decided to take back power by any means necessary.
You can see their selfishness and their bad behavior, and they don't care who they hurt or who they run after to get power and control", the president reported.
The Dundee Stars are 5-3 in the Elite League.
Patrick Doyer scored two goals against Dundee for the Giants.
Dundee Stars returned with a 5-3 win in the Elite League defeat to Belfast Stynes on Friday in a match at Dundee on Saturday.
With strikes by Patrick Doyer and Francis Bellower, Giants had already taken a 2-goal lead.
Mike Sullivan and John Crowney were taking the home side as the Giants' lead driver before they were reinstated.
Lucas Lendweald Nelson won the match for Tandy before he was knocked out in the first round.
This is Adam Kiffy's third Elite League defeat of the season behind Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides, and the Giants won their other three games.
The opening of the Doyer came at 3:35 with Kendall McFall and four minutes later, with Bellower, David Rutherfor doubled the lead.
After a busy opening time at 15:16, Sullivan led the home team back to a 13-10 lead before Matt McWarthe was awarded the crown's equalizer.
Drawer made sure the Giants' lead was still standing before taking the first break, scoring his second goal of the night late in the first half.
The home side group was re-formed and Bouchard once again included them in the level teams with a power play goal of 27-37.
Along with Crowney and Charles Coran, he helped the Dan Dick lead the second half of the match for the first time in the match and secured victory for his team in the fifth half of the final period.
After losing four of their last five games, the Giants arrived at Milton Caines for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller who tried to avoid the earthquake killed a plane carrying 100 people.
The Air Traffic Controller who died in Indonesia after his death was famous for providing a safe landing of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
The massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday killed more than 800 people and left many missing, which was also responsible for the tsunami.
Strong continuous movement is affecting the area, and many of the ruins of Pallu city are stuck.
Many of his colleagues survived, but the 21-year-old Antonio Guenavan Agung, who was forced to flee from the control tower at the Mutiara Sis al-Jufri airport in Palou, was unwilling to quit his job.
He remained in the office to ensure that the flight 6321 of the Battic Air was safe.
He then jumped from there, mistakenly thinking that the control tower was falling.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesia's Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirite said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan in Calimenton to a large hospital in another city.
But we lost him this morning before the helicopter landed in Palo.
"This is heartbreaking news", he added.
Meanwhile, the country's Disaster Relief Agency said authorities feared that the death toll could be in the thousands due to lack of access to Dongla, Cigi and Baotong.
The agency spokesman, Suetopo Parvo Nagravo, said that the death toll is likely to rise due to the lack of access to many people and the fact that many bodies are under the rubble.
Waves of over six metres broke the pavement and caused a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military industrial aircraft are delivering services and goods.
"Every minute, bodies are being delivered to ambulances", said Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who told Sky News.
Fresh water is very scarce.
"Small markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Zellfund, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has arrived at the scene to find survivors of the disaster, but we don't know what they can see there.
It's a disaster, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Sunday visited Palau and told the country's troops: "You must complete all evacuation activities without day or night.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, earthquakes in Lombok killed 550 people.
Air Nugini is now reporting that one person has been missing since the plane crash in Lagun.
The airline, which was flying the plane that crashed in Pacific Lagoon, Micronesia, said one person was missing and had earlier said that the crew of 47 passengers had been safely evacuated from the crashed plane.
In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Air New Guinea said no male passengers were found.
The airline said it was in contact with local authorities, hospitals, investigators and searching for the missing person.
The airline did not respond to requests for further information such as the age and nationality of the missing person.
Local boats rescued the passengers and crew of the plane, which crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
According to officials, seven people were admitted to hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six people were in hospital on Saturday and all had passed the emergency.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and exactly how it happened.
The airline and US Navy said the plane landed before reaching the runway in Lagun.
Some eyewitnesses said the plane seemed to be crossing the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jines said the plane came in too low.
"That's very good", said Jeans.
He said he and his crew were forced to reach the emergency exit door by the water, which was about halfway up the plane.
He said that the flight attendants were scared and crying and he had suffered minor head injuries.
The US Navy said that sailors who were working on upgrading a nearby seaport helped to rescue people with a wind-cooled boat, which helped to save the entire crew from the plane's sinking about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in plane crashes registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Nugini.
Time line analyst releases the woman's burning alive at night.
The prosecution reopened its case against the defendant in the 2014 case of burning a Mississippi woman alive.
As an expert witness in investigative analysis, Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together details of the exact night's movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old deceased Jessica Chambers.
Contrary to his previous arguments, Clarion Ledger reported that using location information collected from multiple cell phones, he learned that he was with the Telez Chambers on the evening of the incident.
When the defendant claimed to have been in contact with his friend Michael Sanford, information collected from the cell phone suggested he was near the chamber, and police spoke to Sanford.
But Sanford admitted on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the lawyer whether Teles was correct in saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "It's a lie, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Teles said they had known each other for two weeks at the time of Chambers' death.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for a week.
After Chambers' death, Routhland said the Telephone Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were removed from the phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defendant's final hearing is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expects to leave for judgment on the same day after the hearing.
What is Conscious Hip Hop?"
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of art with positive messages in their music.
According to The Hybrid from Bristol, hip hop has moved away from the kind of decadence that reflects political messages and social issues.
They want to bring hip hop back to its roots and re-establish conscious hip hop.
Artists like Fuji, Common and others have recently been reviving artists from all over the UK, from the likes of Akala and Locky.
Another black woman?
A New York lawsuit was filed against the couple for "anti-racial" messages.
A New York couple filed a case against a New York couple accused of racial slurs after receiving a message from their mother alleging that they were "another black woman".
The couple denied the racial allegations, saying the case was a form of robbery.
Gisele Morris, a mother of two, was angry when she discovered that she was black on her first day at work in 2016 when she came to look after her son, Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman.
"No, she's black again", says Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, they changed it and sent it to Maurice twice.
When Amaly learned of the "uncomfortable" Place Co Flex Man, the New York Post reported that he left Morris saying that their previous employee was African American, that they had done a very poor job, and that he meant a Filipino.
Morris was paid a day's wages and sent home in an Uber.
The couple has now been asked for a salary of $350 a day for six months as compensation for their dismissal from their jobs, which is said to be their guaranteed salary, but there are no contracts for it.
"I will make them understand that they should not do this kind of thing", she said in a post on Friday.
The couple opposed the argument that they were racist, saying that after speaking insultingly against them, they had no choice but to be fired because they could not be trusted.
"They got a message that my wife didn't mean to send".
But they're not anti-racial.
"We are not anti-racial", her husband Joel told the Post.
"But even if you were wrong, would you be willing to hand the children over to someone who was harsh to you?"
Your newborn baby?
No, not at all".
Describing the case as 'robbery', Plasko said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that they were "in a very difficult situation".
"Would you follow someone like that?
I don't think that's a good thing", he added, who is also an investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the popularity of the couple quickly became notorious on social media, undermining their behavior and reason.
The new letter reveals that publishers in Paddington were concerned that readers would not agree with the book The Talking Bear.
In a letter, Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, says: "Before it is published, it is very difficult to put ourselves in the position of someone who reads it for the first time.
It's interesting to know what we now know about the great success of Paddington".
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the book, was inspired by a small poor man and expressed confidence in the work even when it was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the work after his death was "sweet and sweet".
They described Paddington as "a very important member of the family", and added that his father was very proud of this achievement.
"He was quite calm, and he was not self-absorbed", they said.
Paddington was a reality for him, like you really have a smart kid, and even if we do, we'll be proud of their accomplishments.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even if it was his invention, he credited it to Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On the way down, they took their daughter and ran to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors made tireless efforts to save her life.
"Nad would call to say that she was in a very bad condition, and she didn't expect her survival", said Ms. Ednan-Laperoz.
"Then I got a call from Nad, saying that she would be dead in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
I did exactly that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby".
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors gave her to pump her heart were slowly fading out of her body, leaving her body.
She died shortly before it all ended.
I had to wait there to see all this.
I could not cry or scream in silence, surrounded by my family and others.
I had to hold everything tight.
Gradually grieving the loss of her daughter, Mrs. Ednan-Laperois, relieved herself of the pain she was suffering, boarded the plane with the other passengers.
"No one knew anything", they said.
"I was down, and tears were always pouring down my cheeks.
It was hard to describe, but it was during the flight that Nad's compassion filled my mind.
He needed my love and care.
I knew how much he loved her".
Sad women drop postcards to prevent suicides from bridges.
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humbrieus are the ones who drop postcards on Willish Bridge, including inspirational messages and phone numbers of people to call for help.
Davis' son, Taylor, who had been suffering from depression since he was 13, committed suicide at age 18.
They said: I wish that no other Lord should suffer as I do.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, recalls that her son was a growing chef and the owner of a smile that appealed to everyone.
"He was known to all by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up a whole room".
Before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a completely dark place".
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was only 11 at the time, found him dead by suicide.
"I was always concerned about the consequences of the crisis", said Miss Davis.
Miss Davis created the cards, "You can go out and talk to people and let them know that you have a lot of people around you, including friends.
Don't be silent - you need to talk.
Miss Davis' longtime friend, Miss Humphries, lost her partner, Mark, at the age of 15, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He never said he was sad or depressed or anything", they said.
"We noticed a change in his personality in the days leading up to Christmas.
When the children unpacked their Christmas presents, he did not look them in the face or say anything.
They said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they could only bear it.
They tore us all apart.
But we had to fight and move on".

When the FBI investigates, Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance.
"I felt that if we had gotten what he wanted - a deadline investigation, a limited investigation - we could have brought a little more unity", Mr. Fleck commented on Saturday, adding that the committee, which is in a biased grip, "fears it will break".
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican aides want an FBI investigation?
Time is the cause of their discontent.
With only five weeks to go until the midterm elections on November 6, if the Republicans have not achieved the expected success, their efforts to bring their candidate to the country's highest court will be weakened.
George W. Bush calls the Senate and lobbies for support for the Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House, and through him, Bush meets his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI reports?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will win at least 50 Senate votes, but only after receiving it will Vice President Mike Pence be able to end his conspiracy and be confirmed to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of black people in North Korea is declining.
A South Korean lawmaker said there were fewer North Korean black traders to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byung-seog said, citing the Ministry of Southern Unification, that the number of black traders was 1,127 last year, up from 2,076 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher tariffs on smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of the black traders from North Korea have been granted citizenship by South Korea in chronological order.
Seoul says that about 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have crossed through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers these blacksmiths as refugees rather than illegal immigrants, and often forcibly returns them to the country.
Relations between the North and the South - although still virtually at war - have improved dramatically in recent months
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for the stalled talks on nuclear decommissioning.
This comes after the legendary meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they jointly agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But because of the lack of progress, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho on Saturday blamed the US sanctions.
"Without any kind of trust in the US, there is no guarantee of our international security, and so we cannot unilaterally disarm first", Mr. Murray said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Brett Kavanaugh is "unworthy" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, says Nancy Pelosi.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an outcast and said that by nature she was ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I'm thinking, if a woman had spoken like that now, they would have called them 'the sleazeboat.'" Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
When he talked about his family and his high school days, he was sometimes very emotional, raising his voice and carrying.
Kavanaugh explicitly accused the committee's Democrats of "unreasonable and coordinated acts of murder" by angry liberals over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he shows an anti-democratic attitude.
"I think statements like that and the way he talked about Clinton and Democrats disqualify him", she added.
Pelosi expressed disappointment when asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if he secured a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I'm saying is -- if he's not willing to tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not worthy of sitting in the Supreme Court, but in his current position", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about what Kavanaugh policies would look like against the Affordable Care Act or the Raw Vayed, especially since he was considered a conservative lawyer.
In his affirmative arguments, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether to overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a crazy, easily influenced person to go to court and say, 'That's great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It's a fairly justified insult, a fierce anger that has been going on for months and years, but they can't show it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Miss Stein told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's unnatural, do you?"
She continued, "The woman who was an executive at one place helped me a lot. She said that when I got angry, she would cry, and that she developed the habit of crying when I got angry.
I'm angry with you".
Then they continued on.
And I thought it was a very wise decision".
And tears of increasing anger are allowed, but they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One thing that I remember from my previous job, I was crying in a man-officer office one day because of an unfathomable rage -- then an older woman, a manager I always looked at in fear, grabbed my neck and grabbed me down the stairs.
"They don't want to see you cry", they told me.
"They don't know you're too angry.
They think you're too sad, and they're just happy to get you back.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with him in Gary Hart's presidential race.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on the Monkey Business boat for an unlawful relationship and removed from the race, Miss Scroeder was so disappointed that she thought there was no reason not to be a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision", she said with a smile after 30 years.
"There were seven other candidates out there, and they never wanted another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was long overdue, they were far behind in raising money, so they vowed not to compete until they raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
Some of her supporters paid the men $1,000, but they realized they only paid them $250.
She wondered, "Do they think I'm going to benefit?"
She was very emotional when she stated in her speech that she was not running an audio campaign - thanks to those who supported her, anger at the system that was so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, anger at gender discrimination - all of which took her breath away.
"Everybody thought I was going to get nervous", said Scroeder, recalling the media's response to him.
"You may think that CleanEx is my corporate sponsor.
"I remember thinking, 'What are they going to put in my grave?'
"Did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war is benefiting Baekjeong
Pragathar said that the rift between the two countries would be beneficial to the Baekje Jing when the allies of the US-China trade war are heard and the war is not over.
US President Donald Trump earlier this year warned of a tax increase on Chinese exports of solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most important event of the week was the new price data for nearly $200 million worth of goods, which is virtually half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Each time Beijing has returned the same currency, recently raising taxes of 5 to 10 percent on 60 million US goods.
China has pledged to strike back at the United States, and the world's second largest economy is not going to lose its momentum.
To turn back the washing tone is to be obedient to commitments, but to be publicly obedient to the United States is a shame for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if Beijing can do things right, the U.S. trade war pressure will reduce the mutual support between the two economies and in the long run, things will be in China's favor.
"A political decision that is taken in a washing-ton or bay jing, in fact, would cause an economic collapse in either of the two countries, and the result would be more dangerous than observers had concluded", said Abigail Grease, a research associate with the Center for New American Security with special attention to Asia.
Home Minister says Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country that has been ravaged by seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al Maullam said that the country's facilities are improving.
"Thanks to the progress made in countering terrorism, the situation in the country is more stable and secure today", he said.
The administration is continuing efforts to restore and rehabilitate the devastated provinces.
The refugees now have all the facilities they need to return. Terrorism and unilateral economic policies would affect their daily lives and force them to leave the country.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The other 6 million people living in the country also need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'ullam said the Syrian government would accept all possible assistance to rebuild the ruined country.
He stressed that we do not accept conditional assistance from countries that have tried to create riots or others.
The European Ryder Cup is won again in Paris.
Team USA has won the European Ryder Cup 2018 by beating Team USA. The team won the final score of 10.5 - 16.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
This is the sixth consecutive defeat for the United States on European soil, having failed to win the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Under the captaincy of the Danish captain Thomas Jørn, Europe won the European title again, scoring 14.5 points to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who suffered much of the tournament, took his tea shot into the water on the 16th hole of the par-3 and defeated Francisco Molinari in the match.
Italian golfer Molinari, who has performed brilliantly in all his rounds, became one of only four players to score 5-0-3 in a tournament that began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5&4 to the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorpe John Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Polter of England, who was playing the last Ryder Cup of his career.
Playing in eight Raider Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the tournament's all-time winners with 25.5 points.
"I'm not a quick-crying person, but this time I couldn't control myself.
It was a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy to have won the Cup back.
It is all teamwork and I am happy to be able to help with it", said Garcia, passionate about the European success.
He handed the torch to US golf legend John Rahm, who defeated Tiger Woods 2 & 1 on Sunday".
"I am so proud to have won Tiger Wood, and I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Raham.
Tiger Woods has lost four games in France, and now he's 13-21-3 in the Raider Cup.
With 14 major titles - more than any other - Jack Nicholas, one of the greatest players of all time, had a strange tactic.
Except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who performed well throughout the tournament, the team struggled throughout the USA weekend.
"I'm proud of them, they fought", said U.S. captain Jim Furyk after his team's disappointing game.
This morning we were putting pressure on Europe.
But we were broken.
Greetings to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
Besides, they played well with 12.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Raider Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 and I'm proud to be their captain.
You deserve to be appreciated.
It's just that Ar played better than us".
Red Tide new information: Reduced intensity in pineal, manatee, and sarasota
