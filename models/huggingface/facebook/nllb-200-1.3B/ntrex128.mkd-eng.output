Members of the National Assembly for Wales are concerned that they look like maps.
Some of the Assembly Members are astonished by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that it could be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that  all rhymed with Twp and Pwp.
For those who don't speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means  foolishness/crazy, and pwp means crazy.
A member of Plaid said the party as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said part of his party was "liberal" about the name change, but noted that the similarity between the words MWP and "Muppet" is large.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on any words used to name the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly for Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of public consultations on the proposals indicating strong support for naming the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
For the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support from public consultations.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches for Assembly Speaker Ellen Jones, who is expected to table a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying assembly members and the design for the committee system.
The members of the assembly will give the final vote on the question of their title when they discuss the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was put in place in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts at EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for entry into the EU and NATO.
The St. Martin's bell rings as churches in Harlem face problems
"Historically, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither is there.
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
The bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhoods where people go regularly.
And for the churches, he's worried that the money from the property sales won't last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later, they'll go back to the same place they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced with apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who wouldn't help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings are white", he said, "and so the day will be quickened when these churches will be closed completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
The congregation of black people practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by the Congregation of the Negroes during the reign of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the vendors on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they purchased the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon the "bell of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said St. Martin did not replace him.
What's been going on at St. Martin's for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, partly brought in by the church's inept leaders, and partly by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church board - the governing body of the church, made up of inexperienced leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese was already asking for the expenses to be transferred to the church board, even though the church board was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parish members complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy injured by a shark while diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California, on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack happened just before 7pm near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rowed to the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but then realized that he was shouting, "I'm late!"
You're too late!
His entire collarbone was looking up, Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hamel.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, listed as in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gills, told the press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided the shark was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed the beach from the Ponto beach side in Casablada to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores filled with professional assistants.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household sectors decline, the large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be introduced in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty came as supermarkets began looking for ways to take advantage of shelf space once used for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would for the first time double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line, so most of the products are vegan-friendly, something that is increasingly in demand by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Creighton, south London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend to buy smaller quantities of food on a daily basis at local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounts from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they say increased grocery sales and made shopping more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement over how to split profits from the chemicals stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-see destination for beauty that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby backed out of a £11 million deal
Peter Jones of Dragons Den has gone mad after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with her branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand of household products and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning show host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, stepping down from their profitable lifestyle branded business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million mean she no longer has time to devote to their Truly brand of household products and accessories.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willowby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones hurriedly left the UK on one of his weekends.
A source said: "Truly has always been at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would follow her for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw caught all concerned absolutely off guard.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the opening.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of this morning show host, one of Britain's highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods and the potential for further delay.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couple are going on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We do not comment on his business ventures".
Serious conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he's getting from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump spoke with his voice disguised as a news anchor.
I didn't give up on anything.
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks were postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see an "adequate response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the US continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're very much in agreement with North Korea", he said.
We should be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great partnership.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - he completed missile tests, helped free hostages and the remaining American troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to discussing Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and killed hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, no elementary disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge", Mr. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is forming a team to travel to Palo, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes that routinely strike Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palo, despite the warning, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling through many of Indonesia's islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
A major point in President Joko Widodo's election campaign was improving Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has gripped Mr. Yoko's administration in the run-up to the next year's re-election.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool has drawn against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdán Shakiri passed the ball to Sturridge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, as his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before heading for the far post.
The ball moved high above the sixteenth as it spun towards the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed over the bounced Cape Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always pass as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just shot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker passed with a fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost halfway through, then sprinting through to Liverpool's half.
They quickly got into a fight with Kowacich in the middle of the field.
He then fired a missile, leading Hazard into the 16th.
Hazard passed the defence and finished in the net of the long post with a left-footed shot past Alison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paulo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videotron in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit on Friday and caused waves with a height of 20 feet, agency spokesman Sotopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with a population of over 380,000, was overwhelmed by the blast from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would ask people who have been near John Street in Birkenhead, who have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they will inform the victim's next of kin.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him he wasn't allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants have now been told that it will be hours before they can return.
Someone overheard a policeman tell a man that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
She keeps saying how awful it is.
At 2:00 a.m. two police vans were in the cordon, and another was outside.
Numerous police officers were standing in the curtain and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Fighters Anonymous on 0800 555 111 citing record 247 from September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest memorial blow in the battle to rewrite history.
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "In the current debate over statue removal it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
Cromwell's fine presentation to Sir William Hammo Thorncroft is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell was the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a uniquely recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and mention.
Pig-killer rips apart and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, southern China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door open from the neighboring pigsty.
He stated that there was a large deer in the carriage with the blood of the mouse.
Forensics confirmed that the 550-pound boar tore the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and torn", said the cousin, nicknamed Wu, according to a quote in the evening news in Guangzhou.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police gather evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been previous reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife kicked the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an activator.
They're just playing.
They like to nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane from 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin to bring heavy tropical moisture north into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create heavy rains in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause flash flooding, debris runoff and possible desert landslides.
The heavy tropical moisture will cause rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Maximum 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding caused by rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall is possible.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert in the event of tropical rain.
Early rainfall can cause the canyons to become turbulent rivers, and a thunderstorm will bring local high winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local downpours to parts of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall totaling more than half an inch is possible, which can cause rivers of rubble and slippery slopes.
This would be the first rainfall in the region since their wet season.
Early tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before spreading further late Monday and Tuesday.
The downpour will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes across the United States are expected due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropics remain high.
Sometimes this results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A prime example of a dramatic temperature difference will be seen in the central United States on Sunday.
There's almost a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start to October with high temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could be 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our longer-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for eastern parts of the United States, as far as the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched the stirring testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with speakers interrupting the regular programs for the coup at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, the Arizona senator, made a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had stolen her piano and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, stated that he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as reported by Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that were showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in offices.
To put it better, it's an audience the size of a football playoff or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose hosts were heavily attacked over Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters calling out to him Friday morning as he tried to get into the elevator for the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes closed for a few minutes while they were interviewing him, and it was all live on CNN.
"They're standing right in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are weak".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was supposed to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate ballot.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would review the charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and a few senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was significant, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview immediately after her front-page interview, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should pool their costs was "totally absurd".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Deacon Simson in the death of Louisiana State University athlete
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
20-year-old Deacon Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB partner told CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for their "activity in the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-6 Beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Sims' death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", said the coach.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ejected ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern settlements of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go near the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center has been tracking multiple tremors and tremors.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with law and order police and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede from Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters held by the peace and order police threw eggs and paint in the streets, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights broke out, and the police used batons to quell the fighting.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while the union protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region that seeks independence, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low due to a boycott by people who oppose secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcisse Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia had a chance of gaining independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-elected exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, filming the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"Everything is becoming possible", he said.
On Saturday Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners: men arrested after crashing a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly crashing a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the gate and the building itself.
At one point, a projectile arrow could have been fired at the car.
Menga's win brought Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The progressive Livingston stunned the Rangers with the signing of Steven Gerrard, with his only two losses coming in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's rise proved to be significant while Gary Hald's side climbed one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side went winless in the away league this season and will face the leading Hearts next week, trailing by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continue undefeated in the division in six games, and Coach Holt has yet to face a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the rough guests.
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they scored, and their directness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson tried but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts away after a slip played the head-stroke of Craig Halkett over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause them problems with the actions being taken.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together substituted Menga, who with just a touch scored from the centre of the sixteenth.
By this point the Rangers had dominated possession, but they could not break through the home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out.
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos teased a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow carried the ball away from another set of Livingston action.
Livingston's sixteen was consistently passed and consistently defended, while two requests for a penalty after Halkett's dispute over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and one for a hand-play were rejected.
"Fenomatically from Livingston" analysis
Alasdar Lamont on BBC Scotland at the Tony MacCarthy arena
A phenomenal game and score for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascent path.
Their style and playing character has hardly changed since their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the go.
The Rangers were still lacking in inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard, they're now falling behind by the same standards.
Their last game was a poor one - they only managed to open the hosts once - and that's a small nod to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They were exacerbated by issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came close to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposing protesters portray the division of the visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a major traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred several months after the death of another cyclist in a traffic accident on Childs Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers are working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been placed and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado Unit were brought in to resolve the riots, which involve eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartine.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison's governor had been hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, law and order police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (may be useful for dry areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's likely to do so early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa passes over the desert southwest region, bringing a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, as far south as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mongolian edge of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Carpentine Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside of areas at risk of flash floods, the Rose Rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be useful because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa has led to landslides throughout the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with the cold waters of the Pacific and is receding.
So rain is expected in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Three to six inches of rain is expected from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches, weather.com said".
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move upward over Arizona and southern Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
The main threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be heavy rains in lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States, the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and debris flows, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are asking anyone with cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the most wrath and anger in the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the most brutal and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the most wrath and anger from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassy Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and on her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day".
"A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the significance of the Republican primary.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting", he said.
That's why I'm everywhere, fighting for the best candidates.
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to resist and to prevent.
The first key vote on Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of casualties rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed up by huge waves hitting beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday when waves as high as 6 meters (18 feet) hit the shore at sunset, carrying many to certain death and destroying everything in their path.
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, the tsunami hit.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they became victims", said Sotopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mediation agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it was pulling cars, trees, houses, hitting everything on the mainland", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were completely disrupted without any information from Dongola, said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came at about the same time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man can be heard on the upper floors of the building screaming frantically, warning people on the street below of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water washes ashore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that cut off communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees are still desperate for food and other basic necessities.
The city's airfield has been reopened for relief only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The total death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in maple shelters in the courtyard of their office, they passed through scenes of desolation en route, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
It's too bad.
Even as aid groups began grim attempts to start disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start coming if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can get international aid, but we still don't have a status.
As the second night fell in Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under a ditch for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, when word of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate in the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages ended with only a gray tickle instead of a son.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while loading an ATM at the Newport Pier.
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was servicing an ATM at Newport's dock, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to top it up with cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind the employee of Brink's and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses spotted multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changed His Name to JJ
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Jay.
He tweeted the change on Saturday, writing: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
The forty-one-year-old West had been using the alias Ye for some time and used it for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show who had to quit for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think that 'Jeez' is the most used word in the Bible and it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
Which means I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
From Kane, which means the only one, to only He, the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of several well-known rappers to have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, Jay Z, also uses his own name with or without a hyphen and all capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's Vice President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
The military opened fire on peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funding in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the US has no formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are so far ahead of the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in AI will be made by the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published monthly by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American poker player, and later was a director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked the previous U.S. government technology competition as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the academic leaders, it's the corporations", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to AI PhDs", he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Natural Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to researchers from the US, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Independent Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they're currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments settled in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Ghoshe Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their votes in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not from the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said the "yes" result would be a "confirmation" of our future.
The poll, released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required exit.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of a pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has passed all of Brighton's defence for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly overcame the Brighton defence in a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed through three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four Greens.
He bypassed one defensive player before running into several others on the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then passed left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first arrival on the sixteenth to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a single stroke on the right side of the net.
Aguero has leg problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We were talking about playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But the Sky Blues' starting lead has given Sterling the lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before leading Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues offense got the ball in the net before it went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nashnells eliminated from playoff contention, there was no reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to stand in the center square on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who lead by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies had at least a Joker for the place with a 5-2 win over the Nashnells on Friday night, but they are still struggling to cement their place in the top division.
Even though we're not playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is probably going to be playing at the highest level of any moment I'm facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nashnells still have to announce a starter for the week, but they're reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start in the 34th, has been practicing his throwing on Thursday and will throw his usual rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his selection of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republican outcome in the early elections.
Everything we've done so far is going to be on the line in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones. I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You're looking at these awful, awful groups of Democrats, you're looking at what's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain their power using every means at their disposal, you see the malice, the outrage.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to resist and to prevent.
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, disgusting and untruthful".
He mentioned Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the audience responded with cries of indignation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, I wait a minute. That was very bad body language. The worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer accepting of dissent.
Those who express their opinions are not tolerated
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the latest in a line of Labour MPs who have been told we are not welcome just because he is expressing his opinion.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan has received similar treatment for taking a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, Friday night council meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately, that's not the tone of most meetings today, and the promise of a "more gentle, less violent" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is being judged as acceptable to the party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would never otherwise take, whether it was on national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak in public, and it doesn't really matter what I say, there's a critical harassment on social media calling for condemnation, denial of centre-left policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abusive levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for a "revocation of confidence" or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more opinionated.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years, telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Back when I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government which literally left my classroom in ruins, I fought to improve public services for those who needed them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the demand on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country is going to forcefully go to Brexit which will hurt our households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Moment, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how many critical threats or political opportunism I endure, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

EAR 38  17 Melrose: undefeated EAR goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the outcome somewhat, but there is no doubt that Eare deserved the triumph in this beautifully entertaining match of the day from the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side in the top 10.
In the end, it's all down to their superior defense, and their improved chances, which the home team put up with, and Coach Peter Murchy has every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested through our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations to Air, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's point in the 14th minute, converted by Fraser Climo, gave Eyre the advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Climax had extended Eyre's lead with a penalty, earlier, at half-time, he scored a point, then converted a solo point to make 17  5 for Eyre in the save.
But Melrose started the second half well, and a point from Patrick Andreeson, converted by Bugg, cut the lead by five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was carried off the stretcher, and from the restart, Eare continued to wrestle with Stafford McDowall's point, converted by Climo.
Air's vice-captain, Blair McPherson, was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team bounced back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to knock down Climo without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line at the back of Eyre's sharp attack.
Climax converted, as he did again almost from the re-start, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's shot and sent winger Gregor Henry to a fifth-point lead for the home team.
The star of "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears poised to move into the catering industry after it was revealed that he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be their last, and it looks like Kearnan is planning for life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source told the Scottish Sun that Kearnan is trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant business".
The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a covert-launched naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are stamped with the motto: "The sea is ours by right".
It's our duty to get it back.
Across mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still fresh, as is the desire to sail across the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may now be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of litigation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and tranquility and of course expects a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadia, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant it a sovereign outlet to the Bolivian sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of indigenous descent, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends heavily on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he said at a ceremony in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even if it rules in their favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to allocate territory to Chile and said it will not decide the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the court's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an expert in international law from Chile.
And the last four years may have set Bolivia's cause back rather than improved it.
"The current Bolivian administration has exploited the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes", Zarate said.
Morales's militant rhetoric has undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit", he said.
Calcadia also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the sea issue as a political prop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to move on from the past".
North Korea says it won't go nuclear unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between the rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to believe that continued U.S. sanctions and complaints about a declarative end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a great deal of skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest line of massive hats that's on its way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection of drops or completely block out the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The highly impractical hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers posted their eye-catching creations on the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that flooded the model's head.
Other oversized additions included zirconia watermelons, magic hats, and even pineapple, but they're not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature resembled diving gear complete with glasses and a diving tube, and another looked like melted cornet ice cream.
And if you keep up with the huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Style trackers predict that the giant hats could be coming to stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the straw hat with a two-foot-wide rim worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic fashion house behind the overly impractical hat that spread through social media has sent another great creation down the runway, a straw beach bag that's almost the same size as the model pulling it.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia bezel and white leather sleeve, was the highlight piece in Jacques's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, because the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test scores, which is only reinforced by individual and group success in sport, the arts, music and other community pursuits.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as a subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will make him imaginative.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest pass rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade 5+.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of 5+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved 5.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now seen as an elective subject on a par with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula, as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission found that of the reasons employers cited for failure to fill jobs, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future in having such a life-long skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate, and French was the only language spoken by more than ten percent, or 15 percent of people.
So investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Having more languages, especially those in developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important in OK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a wide range of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying at this moment, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is leading the Lakers to their debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for the fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is yet to be decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play limited time.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
YouTube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump has launched a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five rallies Trump is scheduled to hold next week, including visits to leaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans could lose control of Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online with a live stream on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address the hearing of his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which has been tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with the Senate vote expected to be delayed by a week while the FBI investigates.
The primary purpose of the rally series is to help Republicans gain a foothold in the November elections.
Hence, the Trump campaign said that these five rallies next week are aimed at "boosting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season begins", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, declining to be named.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Willingdon, the rally tonight could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to Metro News of West Virginia.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out the Republican nominee for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come in to improve the popularity of the polls", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes alive at the start of the individual competition on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the Saturday afternoon foursome may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The reversal of fortune is a completely fictitious sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in games like this.
Who would you say is lucky right now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I guess", said Jordan Spit after today's match.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, a four-point lead and 12 more games.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel they have a weak wind in the air despite having enough momentum, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each scoring three points out of four.
Spit was great and he's setting an example.
Those loud cheers of celebration grew louder as his game progressed, with a key stroke leading to a four-four tie when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His winning shot at 15 was met with a similar cry, one that tells you he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to dig deep and take care of your game", Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to go for a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but wonderful duo are four out of four and they can't be wrong.
"Mollywood" were the only couple without a bad hit on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way they seem to flow their energy to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players to secure a potential European win when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, other than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Yet, the talk of European glory remains unjustified.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning double hero, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A missed shot and two doubles out of the top nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
The twos and fours are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between the partners, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't take, and the way strategy can change suddenly.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead on the final day, but the four-man season also showed that the U.S. team could fight even though some, especially the Americans, were skeptical.
The Europeans led 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's 10-6 double and four-way lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins as Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team, which had a lot of misses in the morning double and won the series 3-1.
The Americans put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but they couldn't get to the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual games this week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and the Molinari, dubbed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair overall to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After knocking out Woods and Patrick Reid in double-doubles they played brilliantly and beat the worn out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschambault with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods, who pulled through two swords on Saturday, was at times a great player, but now he's lost 19 of 29 games in doubles and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested as the morning doubles lasted, returned as partner of Henrik Stenson in the fours with a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, Europeans were not amused by the pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2&1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and came back later to beat Pulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in fours, but lost on the opening, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point deficit in an individual game, although as title holders, Furyk's team had a sufficiently even score to retain the trophy.
After two days, however, Sunday's counterattack looks set to stay above them.
North Korea says there's no chance of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened mistrust in the United States and that there was no chance the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and pledging against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to the "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit of the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "nuclear disarmament" of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump gave assurances of North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to relent in the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on "nuclear disarmament first" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem had been South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have ended in such a mess".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the American mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, much more praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for that, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue fully and without exception until complete, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only hours later due to gangster demands.
North Korea has pledged to meet Moon this month to disarm a missile facility and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates to sleep more in order to combat the growing macho culture of learning by staying up all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world's leading universities often know nothing about basic self-care.
Charles Chazler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course for what he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
(Laughter) And at the end of the class, this girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, last year?"
She said that no one, ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a student residence where students press coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know it won't change student behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride in "working all night" still exists, he said, and modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough, good quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon in fighting stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even in avoiding obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a starvation mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond Sowe, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chazler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to take action for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes the next step is to require all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chazler recommends that students consider setting alarms for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED light, which disrupts circadian rhythms and leads to sleep problems.
The Manga's goal knocked Gerard's men out of the game.
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's punch sent Steven Gerrard's ferocious team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Iberrocks were looking to register their first win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager which left his side eight points behind the notable Hearts team in the Scottish Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' position lost inspiration and chances to level.
Now Rangers have dropped to sixth place, and Livingston have moved up to third and are just behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
There may be additional problems ahead for the Rangers since linebacker Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after apparently being hit by an object at a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the semi-finals of the Bedford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same Livingston 11s who won a point against Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his well-trained lineup strangled opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point two minutes into the game when Menga's first innings knocked Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Then a long-range shot by Keehan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only play open in defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there was more hope than faith in their play in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson gave no sign of approving the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lasana Coulibaly's head kick and Owy Edaria's weak shot.
While Livingston's 34th-minute start may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it according to their play.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' strike.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerard reacted during half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winger passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his own line with a block.
But Livingston managed to lure the guest players into playing the type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead late in the game, but McGregor stood up well and stopped Jacobs before Lithgow played head-to-corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, had another penalty request after colliding with Jacobs, but Thompson again refused.
The Almanac: The Invention of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac: "Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we celebrate... the day when the future German physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then it has become a mainstay of science, the Geiger counter has become a mainstay of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Colorado Bell, starring those seemingly unconvinced, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that?
It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Say, that must jump now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot alienated cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot alienated cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize alienated cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and converting them into a laboratory
You can see the protein's abundance in many cancers, and then it's returned to the body.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In one woman, the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, cured ovarian cancer in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so they can look for a protein present in many types of cancer called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that holds great promise".
HER2 go stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of harvesting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells works in treating a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump outburst, wearing a cap with his motto, after a Saturday night live performance.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast on Saturday night after a futile performance that failed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a cap with the tagline Make America Great Again, he began to criticize Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
Saturday night's live show began with a satire starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault on Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's fall was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time backstage because of his cap.
They were laughing at me backstage.
They told me not to show up in that hat.
They were laughing at me!
Then they told me I was at the sinking site, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
He said he was going to put his Superman cap on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love".
His comments drew public outcry at least twice, and the crew of the evening show looked embarrassed, Variety reported, one person told the publisher: "The whole studio is taken".
The news was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
News surprised many with a performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by TPSAD Conservative Group leader Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR BEING OFF THE TOLPAT".
But the host of the show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was her own, and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
"So do we", she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, where he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg goes by the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in a stabbing incident at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackmore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the High Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has attacked the toxic masculinity of the show.
Keith Harington is best known for his role as skilled swordsman John Snow in the violent, medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho-hero stereotype, saying that such screen roles mean young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes something is wrong and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #NowTell era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong feelings" about the matter.
"Personally I have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach men as they grow up about the problems we see today?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: "What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV, and what on the street, that makes young boys feel they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because there's obviously something wrong with young men.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be participating in the sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that it "finished with battles and horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way she gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
Rose played Igrit, a character who had a love interest in Keith's character, John Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year by year, however, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China was growing by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is high.
Because of the country's conservative values, surveys show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data released by a staff member linked to a Republican senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were made by far-right sympathizers and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaked information came shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedSite reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and published information about a Waters staff member, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and false allegations - is in no way responsible for the information provided.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and utterly false.
Waters's statement quickly attracted criticism on the internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nerve-racking", wrote Fleischer.
This shows she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He must not be challenged.
He can't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and calm.
Fletcher appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism from Democrats linked to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant authorities and the police of the false allegations.
"We will allow the perpetrators to be exposed", she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff".
The thought of Johnny English strikes again - undermined Rowan Atkinson's espionage hoaxes
It's now traditional to look for Brexit elements in every new British-related film, and that seems to be true of this revival of the spoof, action-comedy Johnny English franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Will careful self-deprecating about how obvious we are to nowhere be the nation's new export opportunity?
Nevertheless, the big-eyed, grimacing face of incompetent Johnny English has been licensed to "snap things up" a second time - his name primarily signifies that he is a wide-ranging comic creation, made for cinemas in non-English speaking countries.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts at careful glamour, has a bit of a Clouseau look, with a Mr. Bean look and a part of the boy playing a note from the song "Chariots on Fire" from the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once starred in the now-forgotten Barclays TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There's a moment or two in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor, and the rotor fins hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible themselves contain elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy accidents are not as inventive and focused as the silent shadows of Atkinson's character, Ben.
The theme that's been running all the time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent in charge - a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffering from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is giving her all in this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is nothing special in the script to deal with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she'll have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling Johnny English himself who now works as a teacher at a private school, but Black gives secret agent classes: there are some good guys here, when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Beau, played by Ben Miller.
Bowe is now a married man, in a relationship with a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up everything in the Royal Secret Service, are back in action and fatally encounter the beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Beau begin their odyssey of absurdities: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a mess after they reverse themselves onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a veritable anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality hook to get inside Volta's house.
All brakes are removed for the final sequence, but as nice and noisy as it is, there's plenty of kids TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderated stuff.
And as with all the other films with Johnny English, I can't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give him a role as Rowan Atkinson that would take advantage of his talent?
Labour denies they are planning to make the British work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons will work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party supposedly wants the bosses of the companies to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give the workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more workers-oriented.
The move to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior party member told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an endeavor that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace such an idea, the Green Party pushed for a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not been accepted by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of the faceless CEOs and the profiteers in the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not get the whole share back because a Labour government could make deductions for unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds whereby 10 per cent of the capital of private firms would go to employees, who would be able to take an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, give a statement to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and has raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could persuade some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think it's a given", said Kennedy.
I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved into stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it vigorously", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
All the names she named couldn't be verified.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival is taking place, an annual music event featuring celebrity performers and with an impressive mission: end poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete a few tasks or actions such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or some other useful act that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen because it's 12 years away from the whole thing?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something to download or just another case of click-activism - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered over 19 million "activities" by supporters, who have acted for many different causes.
They say these activities helped spur world leaders to set commitments and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and announcements as a result of their activities, of which $10 billion had already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised directly affect nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are Food Power, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers dedicated to helping children reach their potential, which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help tackle malnutrition in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a record", Ambassador Tracy Ullman of Food Power told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been taken up in connection with calls to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, with the government announcing funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
From Global Citizen, they said, "It's going to be a long and difficult road - we're never going to make it.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to blockade Russia's energy exports.
Washington could "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria - namely, where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a front for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe", he is reported to have said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and if necessary blockade their energy from reaching the market", he said.
Zincki addressed the audience at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that presents itself as the "voice of the energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is equally effective.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise the stakes and replace the fuels", he said, while talking about Russia as "one inconvenient inferiority to an economy dependent on fossil fuels".
The announcement came after the Trump administration embarked on a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the "inappropriate" Nordtek 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "slave" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Tek 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion and should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's staunch opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, said Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, which means women at the head of the pack", she said, according to Hill.
After November 6th, I will carefully consider running for president.
Warren praised President Donald Trump's work during the city council meeting and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm too concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominated for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University-Boston Globe Center for Policy Research.
Thirty-two percent support such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination, and 48 percent against.
Other notable Democratic Party names discussed for the 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about the post-traumatic syndrome of Track Palin at the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through since he came back, I know how other families feel torn apart by post-traumatic stress disorder and the wounds our soldiers come back with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "are coming back a little different, they're coming back firmer, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what they and their fellow Air Force, and every other member of the military has given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assault on a female, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington, D.C. support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support a challenge to a new U.S. policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and Washington, D.C. filed an amicus curiae petition Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Parliament case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and violent members of his gang abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was incarcerated in Texas.
The public defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers to the United States originate, as nations with persistent problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Public Defender Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels".
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be tailored to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and such provision violates that principle", according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
Furthermore, advocates in the letter argue that policies that prevent the entry of immigrants are detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to provide the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum exists for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said at the June 11 policy presentation.
Asylum was never intended to be the solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palo as the number of casualties doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palo.
Every minute, ambulances are carrying bodies.
There's no clean water.
Residents return to their destroyed homes and pick up their listed items to save whatever they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Military Hospital in Palo, where patients were being treated outside, due to frequent successive smaller earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he described the powerful quake in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the rubble of the wall, so I think Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard the wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "harassment" with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily listing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about the paid add-on to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, China rejected the accusation.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked a US intelligence briefing for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they are levelling import tariffs against each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were targeted at exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing is hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the De Moyne Register weekly, "is now doubling down on the harassment of propaganda ads in our free press".
"In decimating propaganda, the Chinese government abuses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the nearest newsstand here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you will not see a true reflection of the desperate opinions the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the tough hand of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of the most widely read newspapers in China had turned down his offer to publish the column, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are moving away from women's votes ahead of the midterm elections, because of the Cavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
With many Republicans either ignoring or defending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several sexual assault charges, analysts warn there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated that they want to proceed with the vote.
There's no turning back from things like this, Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, wrote about Hill in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he doubts that pressing for an FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November", Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November Comes!" at a protest in the Senate corridor as Republicans, who control the House Judiciary Committee, decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mick said.
"Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will be high", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news website, said.
People already say they're tall; that's true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it's about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, although a greater number accept the former.
A new Yu-Gi-Oh poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent think the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other, to Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on the open source platform Solid, by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up business.
Now is the historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Internet Data Warehouse" or POD for short.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available in one browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal data storage on the Internet is that it's up to the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it "data-powered personalization".
The idea behind Inrap, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the resources, process and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to implement a complete reversal where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrap's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid3.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrap, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new age of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross-bearer from the First World War
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a war hero has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Hon. Bernard Van received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellingham and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military decoration.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fog and under heavy fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the firing range and "with the greatest courage" drove forward, before single-handedly attacking a cannon nest and disabling three of the attendants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's works were something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us humble.
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Youth Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said it was a great honor to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people.
Combined martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead getting Pepa Pig.
Imagine, you're up all night watching Belator 206 and you don't get to see the main event.
The San Jose schedule contained 13 fights, including six with the main card which were shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gerard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in Britain were stunned when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying up until the early hours because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the transfer of a children's cartoon elephant as "some sick joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Belator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
- Good pig, yeah
Company president Belator Scott Cooker said they'll be working on a schedule that will include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about re-launching, I think we can probably find a solution", said Cooker.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday in our time, and on Monday in their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't. It was a legal matter.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of fights to five instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to deliver more for the fans and we overdid it.
It's an unfortunate situation
Tom Daly felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that everyone was not like me.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 show Discs on a Desert Island, hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show Kirsty Young has taken a months-long leave of absence due to illness.
Appearing as a comparison character in LaVern's first program, Daley said he felt "less than everyone else" as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to have sympathies for boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference were the things that gave me strength and the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without division and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years her senior, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age -- he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it's hard to find someone his age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole outlook had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about "I have to win the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father didn't accept dying and one of the last things he asked them was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't here to be in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible", he said.
The following year Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life - jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride of Heather Small - which went through his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he still got sick.

Mickelson, a not-so-fit guy, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this week when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he'll have to change form to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the five-time champion often represents the United States, he divides his time between playing and practicing his game, the range, hoping to fix what's bothering him.
Never the best leader, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the tight playing field of Le Golf National, where far-out rough shots are a regular punishment for carelessness.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game of the week, faces the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is playing in a tie with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points clear of the 12 individual games, get off to a rough start, Mickelson's play could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the greats and he's given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't picture him playing two games.
I thought more, but it happened and we thought that's what we had to do.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup this week.
It could be the end of a Cup Ryder career where he never achieved the best individual results of his career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence brings something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sensitive, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy at team meetings", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun playing with him, like this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just games.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead ahead of the individual competition on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Dane made his debut in a match at Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they crossed the goal line with their noses only, with the smallest lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a great lead in Valderama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, when we lost and in Valderama, when we won by a narrow margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on this team that this isn't over.
Go ready for tomorrow.
Get out there and play your game.
This isn't over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn added that he was satisfied with the performance of his players on the hard court: "I don't want to give premature estimates on that question.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We're going to have the singles tomorrow, which is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then you're testing all your skills as a golfer.
That's the message we need to send to the players, to give it their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to give it his best shot.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will require players to play better individually than they did in pairs, the exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the turnaround on the final day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word there", he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had united the players before the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like we saw the last start in Brooklyn, like we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set the line appropriately and the team order is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with opposing first and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to do it this way with the guys because I think it's going to cover everything", Björn said of the selection in the individual games.
The new German warship is again delayed
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
Delivery of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeitung, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014 but problematic issues after delivery prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic tracking.
Among other important features is the rarer maintenance - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be absent from home ports within two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships - which are supposed to enable Germany to have power across the oceans - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes De Kight.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was drastically overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - also became an issue.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the newest frigates are particularly important given the warnings of reduced German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, confirmed that the navy is taking out ships that can be deployed.
The spokesman said the problem has worsened over time, as older ships are being withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
A new survey of property in the Scottish Highlands is being carried out to discover how bats use the area in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide answers to the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow common and soprano bats, as well as long-eared brown bats and daubenton bats at Inverough Gardens in West Ross.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds from all the recordings will determine the frequency depending on the species of bats.
Then a map of the habitats will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour within the range.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects beds and habitat loss.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as do fly-stick tapes and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The butterflies didn't actually go blind.
However, their night-time hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct searches, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even establishes Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary on the Treve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species that live in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is ideal territory for them.
"We have a great bat area here in Trive", he said.
We have old buildings, very old two and very good living quarters.
But there's a lot of unknowns about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses that it is important to check for bats before any renovation of the property because unintentional destruction of a litter can kill up to 400 females and young, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don't know how they live".
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news", adding that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, named Catherine Majorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
What was aired today was fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in front of his camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's the norm.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unacceptable transmission of private life suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player will seek damages for moral damages in addition to an amount commensurate with the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident that is the subject of the charges occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99 percent a "good guy" but gave in below that one percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consensus.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken in hospital, but later agreed to a settlement without a trial because she feared retaliation and was worried she would be publicly shamed.
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to have the settlement altered because she has trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack happened and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret losing its car manufacturers
Britain "will forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota-Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border stalemates in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota Auris and Aventis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a shutdown of production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concern about how a no-deal exit from the EU would function for cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
B-M-V, for example, says it's closing its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what carmakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line works on the "just in time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU, for cars as ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border disruption that the industry says could cause delays and parts shortages.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily supply of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "specifically designed to avoid such checks at the borders".
"We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only the success we can enjoy in the present but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 today.
The evidence, not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what's been a very successful whole supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: In my experience, once I take those jobs, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman: "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for Supreme Court justice continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential violations of the law by the president.
Whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Miller's independence has been a topic of debate in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a clash at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that also witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order for an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh charges, which would further delay a Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for the meeting is not yet set, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the things going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things go, and I always try to keep the press properly informed.
Some journalists dispute the claim that Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to a dislike of the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will accept the fact that they have great influence".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president has organized more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at those numbers".
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that more often, and you've seen us do it consistently over the last few weeks, and conversations with the president of the United States will replace press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during visits by senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
Health Secretary's letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system on Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and wishes that they remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of resolving status applications for EU citizens working in the public service at lower levels.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: 'The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued throughout the summer, with the aim of reaching the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of no deal.
I know this is a very upsetting time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of value to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the defensive lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and just fell to the ground", said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the field, then put him in a stretcher and took him for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no information on the type/degree of injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a sophomore and is playing his first season in red at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five saves on Saturday before being out of the game, resulting in a total of 18 saves made this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK
Under Tory's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and this additional funding will be used to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year, which will be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administration fee when buying property in the UK, and this additional funding will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high earners.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the additional funds to reinforce the Government's efforts to improve the situation of homeless people.
The additional amount which, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and the purchase of the property with the intention of renting it out can reach up to three percent.
The Ministry expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which has led to rising prices and made it difficult for first-time buyers to get involved in the process of buying housing.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction firms of offering high property prices by holding land but not using it and asked Mrs May to change quotas for affordable housing in order to remedy the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and an end to evictions without cause.
He also wants to give the councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my premiership to bringing back the British dream, which is to make life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy homes as easily as UK residents.
The dream of owning one's own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of homelessness too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland".
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, has said that his ultimate ambition is to become manager of the Scottish national team in the future.
The Scotsman, 42, is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club who are currently in third place in the Premier League with just three points behind the top club.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad and there was always something that pulled me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be given to me if I am successful in running the club.
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he felt no discomfort knowing he had to follow such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success at the moment is measured by "Can I get this club back into the Premier League?"
"Given the structure and facilities of this club, it definitely belongs in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get this club there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I get the club back there.
Ross has been a manager for only three years, which is a career he entered after working as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the Third Division and brought St. Mirren back from the brink of losing the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads for me", he recalls of taking the Alloa.
I sincerely believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough money out of it, and enjoying certain high perks.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable in this role than I've ever felt in my entire adult life.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (UK summer time).
According to one study, the perfect time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to increased profits for British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin from the CGA business consultancy firm said: "The sunshine and longer than expected England's World Cup participation meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits increased by 2.8 per cent and restaurants declined significantly.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened further during July.
Pubs and bars that predominantly sell drinks saw a much larger increase compared to previous years than restaurants where a decline was noted.
Pubs that predominantly sell food were also badly hit by the sunny periods, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by only 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a holiday and hospitality analyst at the RSM said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is hardly surprising that restaurants remain in a difficult situation, although the 4.8 percent drop in sales over a one-year period will be particularly striking as it complements the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of food-heavy establishments, and the weather will tell whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed respite.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in new brand announcements.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK pub, bar and restaurant sales tracker, collects and analyses data on the performance of the same 47 operating groups with combined revenues of over £9 billion and is a proven reps for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, had a secret social media account that they hid from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted on such accounts
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "master profile" that they showed to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, set up a social media account that they hide from adults.
The study of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram profiles, short for the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is posted on such accounts.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" profile that they showed to their parents, and they also had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile on the same found a teenager who asks others to rape him.
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them".
Elide Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elid Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in the sport's leadership to draw on her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has tremendous respect for Eilidh and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and help to steer the sport in Scotland in the right direction".
The American who won the 200 and 400 metres titles at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to winning a total of four Olympic gold medals and who now appears regularly as a commentator on BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago, he had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was arduous, but I made a full recovery, and I can walk again and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows has divided the Internet
A breast pump company caused a rift on the Internet when it published an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is being billed as the "most gentle breast pump in the world", consumer-oriented technology company Elvie released a hilarious ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers dancing in a cowshed full of hay to a song that goes like this: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my wings, these are my breasts".
The refrain goes on: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my breasts".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlighted the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except for the fact that their babies are stolen from them just days after they are born, says one comment.

Another comment reads: "It's understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, yeah, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their babies?
Another added: "Absolutely inappropriate advertisement".
Others, however, defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was really "funny".
I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I still had milk.
I felt like a cow because of the exhaustion.
The ad is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
"This is a brilliant product", said one commenter.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad for mothers who milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows".
This is not an ad praising or condemning the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced while discreet pumps were tattooed on their chests.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding chest, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave the house while they are feeding.
Anna Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milking and dairy cows, we wanted to bring the pump milking and the challenges that come with it to the forefront, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and intimate way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been in every headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Martha Jakubovsky wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves and were afraid of jeopardizing their own stay in the country if they requested to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are staying in the country illegally and many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we're continuing to pursue these individuals, Mr. Albans said.
In order to speed up the processing of cases involving children, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard voted.
Many of them will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to present their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit to receive relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, shelter workers say, and reports that have surfaced from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size of the facility makes it more likely that signs of a child's difficulties will be ignored.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends may add to the traumas that most of them already face.
Syria has told the American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian territory under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that they would be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle" until we clear all Syrian territory from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The US has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They politicize an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will be directed at the jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who will be eradicated.
UN spokesman Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-Syria constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution", and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandal prematurely interrupt his presidency, as many liberals are likely to hope.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale ever seen!
As of now, there's no sign of any fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the ratings in prime time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen says that Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up 1.7 million from the period four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top cable ratings with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is announced.
"It's like a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand", says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
He said, "Because I think it's really funny", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's also some entertainment value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the well-being of the global economy.
To be excluded from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have already spent six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of the "deep background" source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 knife-leather jacket bomber, and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what it does and what makes you feel like you're watching a reality show is that every night it brings you something new", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for the Trump show's rotating team and daily twists.
You can't afford to miss an episode because then you can't make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week it was sunny and 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while filming on CNN.
He couldn't stop watching, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
I remember doing all these crazy shows in the past and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

The influx of foreign funds in the closest midterm elections in the race for the upper house
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is getting a lot of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts from which there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
This recently reconstructed suburban district of Pittsburgh is currently being run by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th Congressional District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th Congressional District.
The maps were amended after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were manipulated in favor of Republicans, in violation of the Constitution.
The race for the new 17th Congressional District represents a tough competition for campaign funding between the parties' main sponsors, the Democratic Party Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Party National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the March 18 Pennsylvania Congressional District special election, which was characterized by extensive media coverage.
For more than a decade, this seat was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump in June 2017 had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the management team of the Trump organization.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were taken into account only in relation to El Salvador, which received about US$140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without reporting any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate as described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the condition of anonymity.
Their views were backed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn about history
The next thing that might happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is now a lot of solid evidence in the public record.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether the Trump campaign is connected to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to reappear before voters, and possibly a jury made up of his colleagues.
There's a lot of uncertainty here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, nor that of his European counterparts.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such tipping points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot seat since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly offered to film the president and speculated that he was unfit for the office he was holding.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
What do we do if the new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh requested by the FBI is incomplete or incorrect, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And first of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will impeach Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I believe that won't happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on a swastika-logo table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrance of Rangers with an optimistic attitude before the crash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are aware that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win over the Austrians will solidify their position to qualify for Group D of the Europa League.
Graham Dorrance, a midfielder, was ruled out of the season due to a knee injury until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that as a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could accomplish something and came back with a winning score.
Maybe we could have given a little more at the end, but the unresolved outcome was a probable and fair outcome.
They were better in the first half, and we gave it our best in the second half and we were better.
We have another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll come back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough year considering everything that happened, my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's some positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying themselves; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave the last season behind us and achieve success.
Women can't sleep at night because of this retirement savings fear
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few had discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in a study conducted by Nationwide said that they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not communicate your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy, which can help you cover expenses or self-insure with your own funds, if you have them.
Organize your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the start.
Draw up a healthcare authorisation so that you can authorize a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about your financial resources.
This way you would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are unable to do so yourself.
Keep in mind the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs emergency medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medications and his allergies?
Note these details in writing so that you are prepared.

Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was returning home from a night out.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (UK time), as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, emergency services cannot get information from Donggala district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Following are some key facts about Palu and Dongola, on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongola is a district that stretches for more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coast in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The district, which is an administrative region within a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morava, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
The Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency says that Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Dongola in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them being residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police officials.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of release if she pays a sum of 500 US dollars, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he stated that he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he would testify in court, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the filing of a domestic violence criminal report, and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks are down, and the casualty count is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspect in the New York terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipow, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipoff, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck in October to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists he encountered.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipow "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, there is a possibility of a death sentence on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipow on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "gross, brutal and distorted".
"Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Earley, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho", the statement said, adding that the government had also been "deeply concerned about the loss of the lives of the victims of the attack".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also reported that he asked to put the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipoff said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea and serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saif's defense has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during the protest at the Tory party conference promised to mobilize the people's army.
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs suggesting he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would have been out of the EU by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in terms of uniting her deeply divided members was highlighted by the anti-Brexit members of the Tories who joined a special anti-Brexit protest being held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue with the implementation of the Chequers plan despite the attacks from the pro-Brexit, the anti-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue with attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bonn told the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would be out of the EU by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan".
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated now.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely incorrect.'
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party was also present at the march and told reporters: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well received by our party and our activists who are actually the ones who are taking to the streets and who owe our election victory.
Please cancel the Chequers plan and start listening to us.
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to sell Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let you get away with it.
In a message to the thrilled crowd he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has won us the Brexit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit figures marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's rally, a small number of activists showed up this weekend carrying banners reading "Tories against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, the Labour Party member, was mocking the Conservatives over the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the app the party had created.
"These are people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology we need for Canada plus plus, for border-free control, for border-free free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is planning to give the presidential race a good think.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll "consider carefully" running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party representative was speaking about her future during the city council meeting in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Deal, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair in 2016.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, using the city assembly format.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top.
Suspect arrested in connection with shooting and killing of basketball player Sims of the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting and death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which occurred on Friday, has been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Deighton Simpson, 20, at the press conference at 11am eastern time.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing a weapon, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 6-foot-3 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after his team's orders secured victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Walter Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a big role in the race.
From the half-position Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on target as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the box first and left Hamilton to fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the pitch one lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action which forced the Ferrari driver to unwittingly leave the interior at his own free risk of remaining on the sideline after the double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished in seventh place.
He then led for most of the race and steered his car to the finish line to overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the ring on lap 44, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
Today is a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
"The team made a truly extraordinary decision to have their own pair in the race", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at the rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not release the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech to the rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "malicious and disreputable and dishonest".
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been going on these last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and reckless and dishonest", he said.
When you see the news and the leaks and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me".
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you release this information?
Do you remember her answer -- did you publish the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't publish it.
Wait a minute then.
"Did we publish it?" he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein had been sent a letter with information regarding the Kavanaugh allegations by Ford back in July, and the same was released in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish her story", Feinstein told the committee, published by The Hill.
She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what she asked.
But the president didn't seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same thing at the rally on Saturday: "I'll tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use evidence to achieve their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You can see their malice, their meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to kill to get their power and control back", the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Elite League game on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took the lead for the hosts before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Boucher equalised for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season within the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys, who returned with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's chance came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFaul, whose addition was secured by David Rutherford while Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan securing the home lead with 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Cooney to make the score 15:16.
Dwyer saw the Giants take the lead until the first half, when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard returned them with a powerful play and goal, with a score of 27:37.
Kaunee and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen first secure the lead of Dundee in the match late in the second period and he secured his team's victory halfway through the final period of the fifth match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to devastate the area, with many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Guanawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu which was constantly being targeted.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air flight 6321 which was on the runway at the time would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower the moment he thought the tower was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirat, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia said his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Baliqapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palo.
"This news has broken our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims is believed to be increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many are not even accessible", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that reached up to 20 feet (6 meters) devastated Palo, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "The ambulance is bringing bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after previously saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, they could not find the male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuck Island airport.
Officials on Friday announced that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying too low.
"It's an extremely good job", said Janes.
Janes said that he and the others managed to cross the water that was halfway up and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on the reconstruction of the harbor also assisted in the rescue, using a inflatable boat to get people ashore before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents at airlines registered in the GNP in the last two decades, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst set a timeframe for the night the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors ended the case on Saturday for a retrial of the man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he used phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones showing that Telles was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Telles was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Telles said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone records show they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telles deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is due to present its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to rule on the case later that day.
What is this conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to fight negative attitudes about the genre by including positive messages in their music.
Bristol's The High Breed argue that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as music with political messages that aim to solve social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a revival through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a racist message
A New York nanny is suing a married couple for being fired on discrimination grounds after she mistakenly received a text from the mother complaining about the fact that she was still a black woman.
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit actually constitutes "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of work of her new nanny Giselle Morris, she found out she was black.
"No more blackness in your ears", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, she felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing a poor job and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and demanding compensation for the dismissal of $350 a day for six months, an engagement that will include her living with the family, which she was originally engaged to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do this", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the claims as racist, saying that firing Ms. Morris was a reasonable step because they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to a person to whom you were indecent, even after a mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic about this.
Claiming the lawsuit constituted "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
You'd attack someone in a situation like this?
That's not exactly a nice addition from the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington fear that readers will not be able to relate to the bear speaking, reveals the new letter.
Karen Jankel, the Bond daughter born shortly after the book's acceptance, said the following about the letter: "It's really hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the book by a little bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work was not well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family", she adds that her father felt a quiet pride in his potential success.
"He was a very quiet man and didn't want to show off", she said.
But because Paddington felt so real, it was almost like having a child who had accomplished something in life: and you're proud of it even though the success is not due to you.
I think that's how Paddington's success was perceived.
Although it was a creation and a product of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was not expected to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Lapéroux.
Then Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We're going to be together.
The effect of the drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping was slowly diminishing and they were leaving her system.
She died early, which meant all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I could not scream, nor shout, nor cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay clean.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapéroux, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the plight she was experiencing.
"No one knew", she said.
I bowed my head, and the tears stopped us.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an immense amount of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her.
Mournful women put up cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says that her son had great potential as a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him by his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died because it was a really dark place.
His brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that it will have a consequential effect".
Mrs. Davis makes the cards to let others know that there are people out there that they can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to start talking.
Mrs. Humphries, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling unhappy or depressed, so he didn't say anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He arrived on Christmas Day when the children were opening their presents, and he didn't even look them in the eye and make any contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them all, but they had to find a way to get through it:
It leaves us broken.
But we have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future has been uncertain since the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was asking for, which is a time-limited, limited-scale investigation, maybe we could achieve a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was falling apart in the midst of entrenched guerrilla backlash.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due solely to timing.
The midterm elections are due to be held in just a few weeks, on November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases their report?
There's a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate vote, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has decreased under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Byung-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most North Korean refugees eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics focused on the stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed the US-imposed sanctions for stagnating progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot be the first to unilaterally disarm", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The House Minority Leader called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that given his temperament he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted like that, they would say she was 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were teenagers.
Kawano was very emotional in his introductory presentation, sometimes even screaming and kissing as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because he has been shown to be biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi did not answer a question about whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not only unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, he's unfit to serve on the court where he's in office at the moment", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be subject to conservative justice.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for some hysterical, biased man to walk into a courtroom and expect us to say, 'That's really wonderful, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can't get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Statham told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere, and she told me that she cries when she's angry, but she's managed to develop her technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she's talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
I'm mad at you.
And then she just keeps crying.
I think that's genius.
Tears are allowed as a blown valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first male-dominated office jobs is when I started crying with an unspeakable rage and an older woman, a cold manager who I had always had a certain fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got to you.
Patricia Schroeder was at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched a long time ago she did not have enough financial resources, so she promised not to enter the race unless she raised 2 million US dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that some of her supporters, who had given the men $1,000 each, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I should get a discount?" she wondered.
During the speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism -- that she started to cry.
"If you saw me, you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to the incident.
You'd think Clinix was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my headstone.
Did she cry?
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of fire at the start of the US-China trade war was deafening and although the battle is far from over, the clash between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing China's key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly during this week with the introduction of new tariffs on US$200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has been returning to nature each time, recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to give back to the United States in equal measure, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up the same thing any time soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means accepting his demands, but bowing in public to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing does well, the pressures from the trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run as it reduces the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of a sharp economic downturn in either country is far more dangerous than was previously determined by observers", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alim said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to return the situation to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'aleem said the Syrian regime welcomes aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe defeated Team USA in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the lead after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the USA.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, hit the ball into the water in the par-3 on the 16th hole in his first hole-in-one, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of the events, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked player on the European team, Torbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest ranked player in the world, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European to win the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points won during his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't stop crying today.
This year has been really tough.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy we got the title back.
"Team play is the most important thing and I'm happy to have been able to help", said the emotional Garcia after winning Europe.
He now gives his place to fellow American John Ram, who on Sunday beat American golf legend Tiger Woods, one-on-one, by a score of 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching it as a game", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an incredible statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to steer the game toward the grass courts, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we challenged a team from Europe.
We fought.
Drop down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the Professional Golfers Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
We were played.
Red tide updates: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, conditions of uneven algal blooming have been observed in the area of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The red tide, a result of the movement of red algae, stretches for about 130 miles along the coast from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Parts of the red tide can be seen for about 10 miles along the coast of Hillsborough County, but the numbers are still smaller than last week.
A red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Over the past week, the following concentrations were observed: moderate concentrations in or on the coast of Pinellas County, low to high concentrations in coastal Hillsborough County, common to high concentrations in or on the coast of Sarasota County, common to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in or on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, there are still cases of respiratory irritation.
No respiratory irritation cases have been reported in Northwest Florida in the past week.
