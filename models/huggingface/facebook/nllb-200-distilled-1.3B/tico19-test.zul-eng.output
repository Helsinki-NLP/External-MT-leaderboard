Incidence of rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom which ensure that, although at different stages from country to country, the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and critical care units should increase their readiness to receive more COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare, and especially critical care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of people with pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the new coronavirus is now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far shows that 80% of people who contract COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e. respiratory disease with or without pneumonia, and most of these people recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to severe disease requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases develop to severe disease requiring acute care.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in increasing COVID-19 incidence in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with that in Italy between 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 situations in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 has spread widely geographically and the global COVID-19 pandemic is currently evolving in response to the country's situation.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that match the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), meaning that between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Identifying the increasing number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 case figures for each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as each country's Department of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
The data was used to analyse COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and was compared to those in Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of ongoing COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the 14-day interrupted incidence of COVID-19 cases, thereby taking into account the natural progression of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also introduced an increased number of reported cases for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy for the period 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The trends in the 14-day interrupted increase in COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries generally follow those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall in the EU/EEA and the UK, the increasing incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and peaked on 28 February 2020 (Lecture Supplement).
This is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar rising trends in increasing COVID-19 incidence (Learning Appendix).
Figure 2 shows the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to that in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
It highlights that, by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total of comparable numbers to that of Italy 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the epidemic is progressing at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, differing national public health responses, and likely different national definitions of conditions and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization of COVID-19 cases and/or intensive care unit are available in the EU/EEA category in only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
It should, however, be compiled in an orderly manner to match current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 201011 study showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal for a population of 100,000.
This means that countries may have more or fewer facilities than Italy (12.5 acute care and medium care beds per 100,000 population in 201011).
Simulation of healthcare capacity overcrowding scenarios, which provides an average for each EU/EEA country and UK for the increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a >90% risk of exceeding critical care bed capacity, is provided in the sixth review of the ECDC's COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
As cases are concentrated in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve certain regional populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be available at the level of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience in Italy and current trends in other countries suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the situation of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 carrier infection and the increase in COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, and especially intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As demonstrated in a recent ECDC assessment of the rapid threat, a quick, vigorous and detailed approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making the transition from a controlled approach to a mitigating one, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response to the correct approach if not implemented early.
A rapid risk assessment also means public health measures to control the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity in which countries can have a chance to further control their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
Failure to do so, it is likely that health systems in some EU/EEA countries will face a surge in patients requiring critical care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and affected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a human disaster.
Similar to its cousin, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms in a similar way.
However, COVID-19 is more severe and deadly than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more older people than younger people and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and detailed review of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will discuss basic facts about epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review helps to understand and eliminate the menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay indoors during the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named COVID-19.
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to some 50 other countries worldwide.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the world's greatest public enemy and may be more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the virus sequence isolated from most patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research on a new and rapidly evolving topic.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by theCoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and cause of the disease as well as other remaining but important questions.
CoVs are generally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, primarily responsible for 15% of common flu 4.
However, in this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused epidemics that began in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries causing serious illness and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the C.O.V. sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread quickly to neighboring cities, states, and countries.
On January 20, infections among health workers were reported, suggesting that human transmission was a possibility.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24 an initial medical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed conditions, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the original site of the disease from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide (Deaths. (Deaths.2).2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the fate and severity of the epidemic is unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-institutional study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients showed a more updated picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has sickened people of all ages, but mainly aged 30-65.
About half (47.7%) of the patients were over 50, a few under 20, and only 14 under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from conception to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose rapidly before 23 Jan. 2020, coinciding with the mass migration period before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients with confirmed conditions was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the modified mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (men), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are part of a family of large, latent viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, i.e. alpha and beta Covas are known to infect humans.
The spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope attaches to the receptor cells for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral RNA gene, the glycoprotein envelope-bound RNA and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles containing virion, which join the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a novel strain of beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identification among 10 consecutive samples collected at the first outbreak site, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is generally more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electron transfer microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in highly exposed areas on the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV receptor.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 much faster than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein produced by orf3b and a secretory protein produced by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and may inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known active domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported a cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 full-length at 2.9 Å resolution linked to the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that this ligand, which has open and closed structures, was combined as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 ligand is able to bind two S proteins, providing evidence for both the detection of the CoV and infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential target for treatment in drug trials to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the central host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels, respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were identified as the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat SL-CoVZX45 and bat SL-CoVZX21.
However, which host intervened to help the virus cross the biological boundary to infect humans is unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be determined.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be carriers of the virus from bats to humans that involved the re-assembly of similar features within the S protein.
According to the study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nosed, ant-eating mammals commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine - may be the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic differences in theCoV derived from pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread between the two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the confirmed results of strong feminism are still to be seen (Death).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown at present.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive without an organism for up to 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% radiation.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar features.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and to 56 °C of heat for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated antibiotics, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other oil solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can neutralize the virus.
All people generally lack antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore at high risk of contracting a new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Death. (Death.4).4).
Usually, after the virus has invaded the body, it is first detected by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that include receptors such as lectin type C, toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-like receptor I (RLR).
By various means, the virus causes the expression of inflammatory features, the formation of dendritic cells, and the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to evade the immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which combine CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid the immune cells.
However, the CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity including receptors such as C3a and C5a and immune systems are also important in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies taken from a recovered patient inhibit MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system creates a large amount of radiation in the environment that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which has a group 1 infection, is more likely to infect adults with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who have been exposed to a large number of viruses or who have compromised immune systems to be more likely to become infected than other people.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days based on the initial study of 425 people in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 individuals showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on data from 8,866 individuals.
It is of utmost importance for health authorities to adjust the lockdown time based on the correct incubation period, thereby preventing infected but asymptomatic people from passing the virus on to others.
As a general rule, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the lockdown be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and early indicator of COVID-19, which may not be accompanied by symptoms or other symptoms such as uncomplicated coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if no abnormalities are seen on the lung scan, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic survey conducted at the end of December 2019 showed a percentage of symptoms that were 98% fever, 76% whooping cough, 55% dyspnea, and 3% diarrhoea; 8% needed respiratory aid.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group caused by infection from a person without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 population study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), non-swelling cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, which is much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with a higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also noted in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), whooping cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown to be major symptoms and machine-assisted respiration was required in about 14%-20% of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 deaths were 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS in November 2002 was 10 percent of all confirmed cases of 8,096.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 population survey, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The initial study reported that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 are represented in Table Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of the groups usually takes place in the same family or circle or transportation such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and treated patients discharged from hospital may carry the virus again, prompting a warning to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or decreased number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of < 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of < 1×109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of many patients.
In patients with serious illness, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin in the blood, was elevated, and the number of lymphocytes was significantly reduced.
An abnormal radiography of the chest of many COVID-19 patients was found and which had features of double-sided shadow or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often have unusual pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis put the gas exchange at risk.
Malfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to dilate and increasing the risk of collapse.
Therefore, the worst effects of radiography often coincide with the most serious condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the shedding of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membrane, and access of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a terminally ill patient, consistent with the pathology of viral disease and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key diagnostic criterion for COVID-19.
However, due to the high number of false positives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical detection began to be used in diagnostics (which did not rely solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose when the SARS virus was diagnosed.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, medical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological results is important and essential for making a successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang team described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects non-natural RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a stapling rod in a period of less than an hour without the need for sophisticated tools.
We hope that the new method will greatly improve sensitivity and benefits if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the new COVID-19, doctors are primarily unable to provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of therapies that have been used or previously suggested to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These treatments include current and potential antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychotherapy.
It was even suggested that plasma from recovered patients be used as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and is likely to also attack, to a lesser extent, other ACE2-representing organs, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Still, malfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes regular oxygen therapy, increased oxygen flow, ventilation without an anaesthetic, and ventilation with an anaesthetic depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary surgery technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protection of vital organ function are also important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is well-known that cytokine storm is a result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is an inflammatory response system characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the immune system to release large amounts of free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Suppression of the immune system is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other therapies for cytokine storm immune suppression include the regulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; inhibitor of cytokine 4 signaling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids did not benefit from severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Rather, it can cause serious adverse effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, a short course of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses has been recommended for cautious use in COVID-19 patients with severe illness.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment had been established.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed that it could inhibit single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China with a component to conduct research on people with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions between this therapy and other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and the formation of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect otherwise healthy people from contracting disease has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have a higher level of antibodies to the disease in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off infection and other unwanted substances in the body and to identify and directly neutralize disease cells.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation and increased levels of the virus and oxygenation in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to suggest a method for widespread use before a particular treatment is developed.
In addition, in view of the effects of treatment, some of the side effects associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, the immune system can overreact and cause cytokine-release syndrome, which can be life-threatening.
The level of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the need for plasma is great to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce certain antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is very important and sensible to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes of active genes or to filter out active antibodies to replace important viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of many components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis based on the TCM view.
Most of the active components remain unknown or unclear as it is difficult to isolate and confirm such components or their better functioning combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and direct treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms who have recovered from the critical stages.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du pills and the Lian Hua Qing Wen pills were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
High rates of treatment in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in many Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is an inaccurate comparison as other factors of influence such as the number and severity of patients must be included in the analysis.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing western medicine (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time needed for body temperature to recover, for symptoms to subside, and for hospitalization was shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and death was even lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await well-controlled studies at large scales and in many institutions.
It may also be interesting to note the course of action and to clarify the active components of TCM therapy or its combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are often more fearful of the highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who lock themselves in are more bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing as well as serious medical effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of mental illnesses, including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor and sensory impairment, manic symptoms, seizures, and even suicidal thoughts, were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may cause many people to feel anxious and guilty about the consequences of infection, quarantine, and stigma from their family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, people in close contact with them and the general public who need it.
Mental health care should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of electrotherapy devices and social distancing schemes.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected animals to infected humans to potential hosts and are often associated with antibiotics in controlling epidemics caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to develop long-lasting and lethal antibodies and/or protection against SARS-CoV.
Deactivated live vaccines have been tested on animals for SARS.
However, the biological efficacy of these vaccine candidates in adults and models of lethal challenge and their protection against animal-to-human transmission are yet to be determined before clinical research can begin.
This is because SARS was silenced 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, rare cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to appear in the Middle East and spread to other regions because of persistent animal-to-human transmission in infected areas.
Vaccines have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like molecules and subunits of a protein complex and some have been tested on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in infected people is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to resist the challenge due to the long time (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the mutating strains of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full treatment system to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may recover somewhat without the effects of a previous illness.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality in patients with serious illnesses.
Therefore, building a model of the cause of disease is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the cause of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age was a very important factor in causing SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily occurred in the 30-65 age group and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in the study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were at higher risk of developing other diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a contributing factor in the outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Pre-existing and complicated diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are at higher risk of developing severe heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart-related events were also a leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is also able to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is good to note that age and preexisting illness are closely related and may interfere.
Unusual laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a possible factor in disease, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
A link between CRP levels and the severity and cause of COVID-19 has also been made.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during muscle injury.
As a result, they are common signs of heart or liver failure.
Severe medical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient progression of medical symptoms should be considered along with other predictive and complex COVID-19 outcomes.
Use of steroids: As described above, immunosuppressant steroids are often used as an adjunctive treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
With high doses of corticosteroids being widely used in patients with severe SARS, most survivors had avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from severe depression as they had to endure long periods of isolation and severe uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Long-term counseling and support are essential to help these patients recover from depression and return to a normal life.
In accordance with demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate easily in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to the Covas that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or during the incubation period may produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which causes great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients were very ill, whereas most infections did not occur in the early stages.
As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are several ongoing efforts currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing lockdown of the entire population in the hope of curbing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused severe economic and other damage to the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the pace of the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the decline will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some scholars have no such hope.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be more transmissible than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be a recurrent flu-like episode.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of young patients, suggesting that current strategies may be working.
Initial predictions were that Ebola would infect a million people and kill half a million.
However, with strict isolation and isolation, the disease is finally under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become weaker and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that can survive in humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Deaths. (Deaths.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with infected objects.
The virus was also found in the feces, opening up a new possibility of oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41 percent of patients may have been infected in hospitals, including 17 patients with preexisting conditions and 40 health-care workers.
Therefore, extreme caution must be exercised to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, even people who stand close to patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that may be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series #1860s) help control the spread of the bacteria.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid particles from a person who may be infected from traveling through the air and sticking to the surface of objects, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series #1860s) can protect you from inhaling small virions at 10 to 80 nm, while only 5% of virions can pass through completely; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV both at about 85 nm.
Since particles can pass through five combined surgical masks, health care providers who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (series # 1860s) not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear protective gloves that fit well to further reduce contact with germs.
Germs can enter a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his swollen eyes.
As a result, health-care providers should also wear reflective face shields or glasses while working with patients.
In the general population in areas affected or likely to be affected, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap and detergent more often than usual, try to stay indoors to isolate themselves and limit contact with people who may be infected.
A distance of three paces is considered the proper distance for people to stay away from patients.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 arrived as a new virus in the human world, its similar structure to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have been a wake-up call to China because it was still recalling the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan assured citizens that the new virus has low infectivity and has low replication from person to person and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
The message alerted the public, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, and they missed a critical moment to control the virus while it was still not out in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may learn from this critical lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements as each word is important to citizens and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from the clinic rather than waiting for authorized reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more proactive in controlling potential epidemics in their early stages rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) conduct regular and effective guided drills to improve public awareness of epidemics and to assess and improve the response system of the community in times of crisis.
COVID-19 outbreak caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar also between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense that SARS is recurring.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for epidemic control and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more people of childbearing age than younger people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher among older people than younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms while SARS patients transmit it when they become seriously ill, which creates a greater problem of controlling the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A routine RNA analysis for SARS-CoV-2 may be toxic to some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients may also test positive for the virus.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a few critical problems remain to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although it found 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat-CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What intermediate animal transmitted the virus from the first host, say, bats, to humans?
If we do not know the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot successfully stop the transmission, and the seizure can get worse at any time.
Although cell models and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory tract cells and cause the resulting disease-causing changes?
Does the virus also attach to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague continue?
How do the genes of viruses change during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it end like SARS, or will it become more severe from time to time like the flu?
It is important, but it may take time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The origins of the animal-to-human virus of human coronaviruses
Change and adaptation have promoted the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause minor illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed the situation to show how devastating and life-threatening the HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 again put CoVs on the scene and surprised us with higher infectivity but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV disease is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs can help.
Most HCoVs originate from bats and do not cause disease in them.
The intermediate hosts of other HCoVs are also known.
Identifying pet hosts has direct implications for human disease prevention.
Studying the interaction of the host of the CoV in animals may reveal important insights into the structure of the CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a summary of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, and will focus on their discovery history and their zoonotic origin and transmission to various organisms.
More importantly, we compare and classify different HCoVs from the point of view of mutation and genetic linkage.
The current outbreak of the 2019 COVID-19 disease is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host mutation and the effects of mutation on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are part of the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of isolated, single-stranded, single-stranded RNA-sensitive viruses.
These bacteria contain the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called ama-CoV because of their crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Structurally, the genome-free CoVs have a similar sequence.
About one third of the genome has two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated into the pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicases.
The polyproteins are further processed to form 16 additional unstructured proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs, structural proteins that include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of list-specific helper proteins also code for various lists of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequence, CoVs are classified into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV subfamily contains most HCoVs and is divided into four categories (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the source of the genes for alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CVDs have continuously crossed biological boundaries and many of them have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 cause severe illness, causing severe lower respiratory tract disease in a large number of patients which causes a high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other extrapulmonary diseases.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal swabs of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gained through detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause restrictive symptoms.
In fact, it was generally accepted that administration of HCoVs was generally safe until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people and having a mortality rate of nearly 10 percent.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with occasional outbreaks in other parts of the world.
The novel 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must be prepared for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice or domestic animals.
The majority of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses adapted well to the environment and did not cause disease but showed many genetic variations.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the biological history, dynamics and limiting factors of organism migration.
This may also guide or assist in the identification of the cause, intermediate and host-animal replication of SARS-CoV-2, which will have important implications for preventing future transmission.
In this review we present a summary of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs generally do not cause disease in their natural host but cause disease after infection of various organisms with a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoVs where increasing infectivity often comes with decreased pathogenicity.
The effects of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal swabs of patients who had contracted the common cold, different CoVs were isolated from infected animals of various species, including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoVs' sequential discovery (Table 1) may be useful and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract disease in 1966, and was accepted to grow in lung cell lines of WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, and fever and cough were observed in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 isolated from a tissue organ and a sequence pathway in the brains of mammals.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 disease appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which was not distinguishable by symptoms from infection with other respiratory tract diseases such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and are most commonly transmitted during the winter season in suitable weather.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to studies of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experience a mild, common cold.
Only a few patients with depressed immune systems showed severe lower respiratory tract disease.
SARS, also known as rare pneumonia, was the first HCoV-caused pandemic in recorded human history and is the causative agent of SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic resulted in a reported 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, spread over many countries and continents.
Apart from the main pathogens, it was estimated that each case could cause at least two more cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak of the virus dose occurring on day 10 of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially appeared to suffer from myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and fever, followed by dyspnea, cough and shortness of breath as the latter symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are among the common laboratory abnormalities due to SARS.
Widespread alveolar damage, rupture of epithelial cells and increase in macrophages have been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also become infected in these critical conditions, often accompanied by a cytocin storm, which can be especially lethal in patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from open lung surgery of a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, major efforts have been made in the area of HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The development of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in infection caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study isolated a similar virus from the nasal tissue of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has actually spread throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing minor respiratory illnesses.
All of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and generally have little chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons such as in the rare case of the highly lethal HCoV-NL63 subtype, which is reported to cause a severe lower respiratory tract disease in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit easily and maintain a continuous state in humans, they are also lethal or become less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases are spreading to nearby infected reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The medical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, most MERS patients developed severe renal failure, which is currently the exception to MERS among HCoV-borne diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a mortality rate as high as 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses in humans.
From mid-December 2019 to late 2019, a number of patients with known SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were reportedly 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the other outlying region is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe respiratory illness similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which has been characterized as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the similarity in the 82% high nucleotide sequence structure, there are distinct groups in the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There are reportedly people who do not have symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the HCoV infection are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 disease exhibits characteristics commonly seen during infection with HCoVs found in the community, including absence of clear, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of COVID-19 critical cases can also be identified as in the case of SARS-CoV disease, although the rate is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection also shows interesting patterns that are characteristic of both the HCoVs found in the community and the SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs found in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be determined whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is decreasing as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, similar to other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in wild samples.
Whether oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in terms of SARS-CoV under certain conditions remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will show seasonal outbreaks as is the case with HCoVs found in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained transmission after transmission to humans will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All HCoVs found in the community cause mild symptoms and have adapted well to humans.
According to one theory, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived an ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs cause serious illness in humans and no serious HCoV infections have been reported.
To achieve this, HCoVs must replicate in humans at a sufficient rate to allow the development of adaptive mutations that are resistant to host-containment factors.
In this way, if the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, there will be a greater chance that it will adapt more to humans.
If they adapt very well, their transmission to humans may be difficult to prevent by isolation or other means of infection control.
For many years, four CoVs have been found circulating in the human population, causing a common cold in people with a healthy immune response.
These bacteria do not require an animal source.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not yet adapted well to humans and their intra-human transmission cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow in their zoonotic source and look for an opportunity to move on to vulnerable prey, perhaps with one or more intermediate hosts and to be raised by hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs found in the community.
It is highly contagious like HCoVs found in the community, at least in the original organism.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs found in the community and has less pathogenicity to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it will fully adapt to humans and move around without a central source or host remains to be seen.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it is helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the mutation hosts, which are the natural, source, intermediate and breeder hosts of HCoVs.
An animal becomes a host of the HCoV mutation if it incubates a closely related ancestor with whom it shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The bacteria that cause the disease usually adapt well and do not cause illness in the host.
Similarly, the source host infects the HCoV continuously and for long periods of time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infectious and are natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV is reintroduced to an intermediate host before or around introduction to humans, it has not adapted well to the new host and often causes illness.
This central host may be the zoonotic source of human infection and play a role in the growth of the host that allows the virus to temporarily replicate and be transmitted to humans to increase the rate of human infection.
HCoVs can undergo final infection if they cannot maintain their infectivity within the central host.
In contrast, HCoVs can adapt to an average host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the average host becomes the host of the natural resource.
Epidemiological data showed that in retrospect the SARS reference patient had a history of contact with game.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that animal traders had higher IgG resistance to SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Masked palm civet (paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in the pet markets were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the civets in the market were killed.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets in the wild or on farms that have never been exposed to live animal markets were toxic to SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be moderate breeding hosts but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy, that 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies against SARS-CoV, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals are intermediate breeding hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research of the SARS-CoV natural host animal revealed a closely related bat-related CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horse shoe bats.
These bats are positive when it comes to antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have led to the new theory that bats harbor new pathogens in humans.
SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but none other than the so-called WIV1 has been classified as a live virus.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a response to SARS-CoV.
WIV1 taken from a bat fecal sample was shown to use the bat, civet, and human ACE2 as a cell entry response.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to kill WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of the nucleotide sequence.
Although there is high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest parent virus to SARS-CoV and that bats are not the closest hosts to SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis includes MERS-CoV and the same group as the bat-CoV-HKU4 and the bat-CoV-HKU5.
Both the bat-CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for infection.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically close to its beta-CoV counterparts in bats found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat-CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the homology of the nucleotide sequence.
As a result, bats may not be the nearest source of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-killing antibodies directly, similar to camels native to the Middle East in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV similar to a virus found in humans was isolated from a nose swab of dromedary camels, further demonstrating that camels are the true source host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that usually mild but severe virus outbreaks were observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV according to the study.
It is noteworthy, though, that infected camels not only expel germs through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral tract, which is also the main route of excretion of the bacteria from bats.
However, questions remain as most MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, whether it is human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat-typeCoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to attribute parental relationships.
That is, bats are not likely to be the nearest source host of SARS-CoV-2 unless similar bat-CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is thought that hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 medium animal should be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, most of which were related to the early COVID-19 illness, suggesting that there may have been an event of animal-to-human transmission.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may have bred older SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 by about 90% identification at the nucleotide sequence level.
They combine into two sub-classes of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a highly similar receptor adhesion domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high level of genome-wide homology sequence.
Previous studies of sick pangolins reported the detection of viral contigs in lung samples, which appear to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of engineering techniques and manual programming to create a partial genome sequence that makes up about 86.3% of the total length of the virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the closest hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that pangolins are the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolin related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be discovered.
Although higher sequence homology has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 and related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share higher genome-wide sequence homology.
There are high suspicions that the high degree of similarity between the pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 RBDs of beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective mating evolution.
Another proposal recommends a recombination between the pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal.
As the force drives evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
A conclusion has not yet been reached regarding the near-zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were obtained from mice.
A bat-like CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in a North American three-colored bat was reported to show a close relationship to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat-typeCoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while camelliads have been suspected of being its closest host.
For clarity, current information regarding animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of instances of HCoV infection in the past.
When HCoV-OC43 was transferred from one animal to humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory disease epidemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E's transmission from organism to organism is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, are more likely to interact with bats in the same environment.
Rather, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the alpha-CoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and do not cause disease in bats, while the alpha-CoV of alpacas caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in wild animals.
As a result, we cannot ignore the possibility that alpacas may have transmitted the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV to humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause human illness, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
So it is not surprising that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, when alpha-CoVs in bats act as a genetic pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels are likely to be the intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the transmission of different organisms from bats to dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial diagnosis and is confirmed by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a variety of bacteria with the opportunity to exchange genetic material between different animals and to infect different animals.
Long life, dense colonies, close social ties, and a strong ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats to be good 'virus carriers.'
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for centuries.
It is well adapted to these camels that have evolved from a medium host to a stable host and natural resource.
MERS-CoV causes little disease and has a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its transmission to humans is erroneous and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is distinct.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are the most common cause of pangolin illness.
They may be the final host of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
The limited possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans by different organisms should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First, bats may be the host source of the SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may play a similar role to bats by operating on animals or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be the central breeding host where the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been introduced.
People get the virus from surgery and from eating hunted meat.
It is possible that many mammals including pets may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
An immune system survey of domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third animal that is related to both bats and pangolins.
The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
In addition to the various types of animal hosts, there are three major factors on the viral side that are important in making CVDs cross the biological boundary.
First, their high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single strand RNA viruses, the rate of mutation rates for CoVs may be considered low to high with a rate of mutation of ~10-4 per year per 2 cent, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have a defect-seeking exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in high mutation rates and decreased potency or inability to grow properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress the replication of the CoV by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the CoVs are about a million higher than those of the hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually higher if the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high degree of adaptation to humans.
It is thought that it may already have been adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
It is thought that it is unlikely that genetic mutations could cause vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 to be ineffective immediately.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs uses more flexibility in genome modification for change and recombination, thereby increasing the chance of co-evolution of different organisms, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by many distinct open learning frames and protein functions produced by the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs constantly change templates at random during RNA replication in a different selective-copying manner.
In the host that acts as a mixing vessel, mutations occur constantly during transcription of the CoV RNA.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs may recombine to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interaction of the virus and the host in terms of infection
In addition to the three viral features mentioned above, the interaction of the virus and the host- host response is another key factor that influences the transmission of different organisms.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a common example, which demonstrated evidence of positive selection during incidents of cross-infection.
Based on comparative analyses between isolated individuals and SARS-CoVs in civet, it is thought that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptive status in different hosts, particularly through mutations in the RBD of S-protein.
Generally, RBD in the S protein of the CoV interacts with the cell response and is strongly selective for host immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located on the 318 to 510 amino acids in the S1 subunit, which binds to human ACE2 and its coreceptors to infect the virus.
The RBD for SARS-CoV is able to detect ACE2 responses of different animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoons, allowing for the transmission of the virus to different organisms.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been identified that differ from the isolates of human virus and civet in RBD of which 4 are found in a motif that binds to the receptor to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the civet has mutations in K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the rate of interaction of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, this mutation of two amino acids may be important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell response as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein means that the rate of interaction of S protein with ACE2 in humans may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM studies show a 10 to 20-fold higher level of this coiling than that between human ACE2 and the S protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether an additional coreceptor is needed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different S-terminus.
There are other HCoV-receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be considered the reason for the successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after infection of different organisms from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular responses, the effect of HCoV infection on different organisms is also controlled by the dependence of one organism on another and by borderline factors.
Differences in these host proteins between humans and hosts that are the natural source of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and mice may cause a cross-infection barrier.
HCoVs must take host-dependent features and disrupt host-inhibitory features for successful organismal transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants of this important host-interacting site have yet to be identified and characterized.
Extensive genome-wide, unbiased screening of host-dependent and restrictive features of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCoVs emerge: back to basics
Variation in bat-CoVs provides many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a set of genes for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and recombination of genes also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that code for a new protein has the potential to dramatically alter the phenotypes of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related parasites are isolated but found to produce different ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion factor of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated species early in the human pandemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host changes.
Otherwise, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha and gamma CVDs, where a large number of small recombination sites were found in RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
Rearrangement sites were also found in nsp9, in the major part of nsp10, and in parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that selection may contribute to unintended changes in the viral genomes, which may result in the release of the viruses from the selective pressures used, such as those of the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to the removal of a double nucleotide.
Although full ORF4 was observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, the alpaca alpha-CoV exhibits single nucleotide insertion, leading to a change in the frame.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by pressure to select from their source hosts.
There were no or only mild symptoms found when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating similarity between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to be well adapted to CoVs in structure and function.
For example, disruption of the inflammatory response in bats easily reduces the pathology induced by CoVs.
Otherwise, the activity of the natural killer cell in bats is suppressed by increased response of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell receptor barrier and a low expression rate of complex histokompatibility class I cells.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the high-energy digestion of bats may affect both the suppression of COVID replication and the detection of exoribonuclease errors, thereby providing selective pressure for the formation of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when introduced to a new host.
Highly pathogenic CoV strains may also mutate through recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein features of host adaptation.
As a result, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs do not cause illness or minor symptoms in their main hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate quickly without stimulating a strong immune response.
Here are secrets to why asymptomatic carriers are detected and what causes serious conditions in human disease.
The most severe symptoms are mainly caused by an over-reaction of the immune system and a cytocin storm when there is a strong immune response, the lung damage becomes more severe.
In contrast, in those without symptoms, the immune response has been divided into two to the recurrence of the CoV.
The same technique for isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the use of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is ineffective.
According to this hypothesis, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common theme of the evolution of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat beta-CoV has been identified that shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a batCoV that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the nearby intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been identified with a similar structure to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be other intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs may have contributed to the genetic components of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally engineered by humans.
CoVs have returned to the scene due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal sources of HCoVs in human infection.
Widespread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection comes from human-to-human contact with civets in markets, closing live animal markets and killing civets could end the SARS epidemic.
With similar reasoning, pangolins should be removed from organic markets to prevent zoonotic infection, considering the discovery of multiple beta-CoVs in pangolins that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals remains to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, honey, leather, and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to kill all camels to control MERS, as is the case in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be used to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, along with other disease control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these bacteria, new genotypes may emerge to cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the desert.
In particular, zoonotically active bat CoVs are highly variable.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will mutate and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that are more infectious and/or lethal in humans in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the incidences of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there must be a better preparedness and response system.
In fact, many germs have been around for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to escape.
Although bats have many features that encourage the spread of germs, the chance of humans coming into contact with bats and other wild animals can be reduced if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be helpful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent zoonotic germs is to keep people away from the natural environment of zoonotic germs.
A few pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been discovered.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to pangolins, it will be useful to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share environmental similarities.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human infection, it is necessary to find out how humans communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal is to act as a true central host, its interactions with various creatures, including humans, bats, and pangolins, must be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and infection research should be conducted.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses will be derived from its natural host in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, and important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
A review of the diagnostic criteria for those suspected and confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 is needed.
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), and this guide provided our experience and made a relevant reference for combating the global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our vigilance and understanding are increasing based on ongoing research and experience in medical procedures; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continually being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment about our guide and provided a new identification criterion for those who are suspected and confirmed to be ill according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid response guide and published it online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since its publication.
Be aware, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and awareness and knowledge about it is increasing based on research findings and medical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continually being updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has released seven volumes with some significant changes.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who presented a simple suggestion for a score based on their own experience.
Their work adds to our pioneering new evidence and makes a significant reference to the pandemic worldwide.
We commend their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be reviewed in line with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition of the study) and the latest research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected disease it is necessary to combine either one of the epidemiological history factors and two clinical indications for a comprehensive analysis, or it needs to meet three clinical indications that do not have a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of visiting or living in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (via positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of confirmed contacts (≥ 2 patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms that occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, in the home, office, school, classroom, etc.).
Clinical signs: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) having characteristics typical of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the first stage.
A confirmed diagnosis of disease should be based on suspected disease with at least one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete virus genome sequence showing high homogeneity to known novel coronavirus viruses; (3) positive presence of critical IgM antibody and IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or a change in the IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from positive to positive, with a t-value greater than ≥4 times the normal range.
We note that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) schedules.
Pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) schedules; and serological evidence was included in the seventh schedule.
These changes are based on ongoing work by researchers to find a high-nucleic acid rapid diagnostic kit, as well as respiratory tract samples including a blood sample, which increased the detection of various tissues, and supported the delivery of a positive immune response to a confirmed subject.
Besides, there is more evidence to remind us to be cautious of patients with rare and non-symptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be revised, as it refers to a person without medical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated at work and in ongoing medical studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more evidence is forthcoming and invite readers to comment.
To make a diagnosis of "suspected illness" and "confirmed illness", we recommend that new international pioneers be followed and listened to at home.
Our team will also review our guide to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19-related deaths, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths caused by COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of days ever caused by the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the reported number of cases is 114 with 33 recovered who are staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news forum, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were in their 60's, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
He also said that two were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport Obaidul Quader said public transport will be closed for longer than planned, until next Saturday.
The ban on public transportation had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential goods - medical supplies, fuel, and food - is still prohibited.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 disease in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had already recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
This happened on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus-related illness and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries free of the coronavirus.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, with nearly 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infection.
Around the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's curfew until May 1.
Worldwide, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will continue to have a non-working day until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; a vote was passed with 215 votes in favor, 10 against, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last all day; previously, curfews were between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia have lowered the purchase limit for small-scale household paper for each purchase
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australia's supermarket chain Woolworths and Coles reduced its purchase limit for toilet paper to two and one pack for each purchase in the nation's stores, respectively.
ALDI also introduces a one-pack limit, on Monday.
These restrictions are posted as messages at check-out, and on the store's Facebook pages.
Consumers have continued to buy in bulk due to fears of COVID-19 in case they need to quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths again limited the purchase of toilet paper from those brought home to one pack per order.
These changes follow the previous limit of four packs per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that with a four-pack limit imposed, ""many stores are still running out of supplies about an hour after delivery"", and called the demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI, in its Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was ""unexpected"."
"Sales have ""surged"" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesman".
A Costco store in Canberra also reduced the allowable amount to two packs last week.
To address the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and announced an increase in deliveries, Woolworths ordered more stock, while ALDI made the stock of the scheduled Wednesday special available immediately.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on delivery times are making things difficult.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the immediate release of stock, some stores could not continue the Wednesday offer.
In a report for News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a marketing expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up every night.
He noted that small-scale household paper is a heavy product, leading to a low stock value in terms of quantities, and, when used up, leaves a large open space, reinforcing the feeling of being worn out.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion [that] if there were more items on the shelves, if a product like paper rolls and a sanitary pad could be [purchased] and available in abundance, it would probably reduce anxiety, says Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stressed that they work 24/7 to keep the product up, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate agents are giving free paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, where few auctions are held because buyers have a break due to the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, Darwin's daily newspaper, included an eight-page appendix designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 when they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitary napkins, dried foods, laundry soap, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night the British online supermarket Ocado was seen limiting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two for a 12-roll pack.
The World Health Organization has called COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19  a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  a pandemic.
"While the term ""epidemic"" refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not to the extent to which specific examples are dangerous, WHO has shown concern about the need to motivate governments to take action:"
Not all countries can change the course of the epidemic.
When countries investigate, diagnose, treat, isolate, track and respond to human movements, they control their movements, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Executive Director of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming and severe spread and the alarming lack of movement.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is ""unprecedented""".
"He said, in a commentary announced on CNN in February, ""apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its emergence to its global spread""".
"Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying ""we have never before seen a pandemic eradicated by a coronavirus spark""."""
"He continued, ""and we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time""".
The new epidemic situation follows WHO's January decision to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""what remains, will only get worse"".
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and classified as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, 1.61 million accurate cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 confirmed deaths.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The number of extinctions has been estimated at 4% in China, while the global figure ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Problems may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can last from two to fourteen.
There is no known cure or treatment to defeat the virus.
The main treatment is based on symptomatic and supportive care. Suggested precautions include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from others, and being vigilant and isolating yourself from people who may suspect you of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine, curfews, workplace safety measures, and lockdowns.
The epidemic has led to severe economic and social disruption worldwide, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of basic necessities that have been consumed by shopping.
Schools, including universities, are closed nationwide or in 193 countries, affecting precisely 99.4 percent of the world's majority of students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of racial and ethnic discrimination against Chinese, some people of Eastern and North Asian descent and appearance, and others from stories with many examples of the virus.
Reduced transportation and the closure of large factories have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Many of the cases were related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the virus is thought to have originated from animal transmission.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, an emerging virus closely related to the bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The first known person to show symptoms was later found to have started to get sick on 1 December 2019, and that person never had a clear connection to the wet market virus.
In the first batch of examples reported in December 2019, three components were found to be interconnecting in the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, may be the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases are reported declining in China but increasing rapidly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be fewer cases reported, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, minor cases had been reported among adolescents, those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be vaccinated for effective herd immunity to be achieved.
Examples refer to the number of people tested for COVID-19, and their testing to confirm confirmation in accordance with legal process.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries had laws preventing testing for those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and this undocumented transmission was the source of 79% of documented cases of the disease.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy is much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the normal fertility rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most often 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, nearly 80% of the deaths were those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health problems including heart disease and diabetes.The official COVID-19 death toll statistics generally refer to people who died after being tested positive for COVID according to a legal process.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it does not include all deaths without diagnosis - e.g. at home, nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of overdose deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death toll by 4-5 times.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the published death toll] is underestimated"", a statement that is consistent with anecdotal reports of undercounting in the U.S. Such underestimates are common in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On February 28, outside China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary by location and over time, and are influenced by the size of the diagnosis, the state of the health care system, the types of treatment, the time since the outbreak began, and social factors such as age, gender, and overall health.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the estimated death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms on 1 February 2020).Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of tested persons who die from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (tested and untested) who die from the disease.
These statistics are time independent and follow the number of individuals from infection with the sample solution.
A number of scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate of the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high rating of this grade is consistent with results from randomized COVID-19 testing in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the results of CFR-rated testing.
WHO claims that the epidemic is manageable.
The exact severity and duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"If left unchecked, the infectious outbreak naturally subsides and begins to subside when the disease runs out of carriers", said Maciej Boni of Penn State University.
"But it is almost impossible to make a definite prediction at present as to when that will be""."
"The Chinese government's chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said ""it could be as late as June"" if all countries made a move to follow WHO's advn measures to contain the spread of the virus".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine spoke that SARS-CoV-2 ""will go around, strongly for one or two years""".
"According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be necessary ""until a cure is found (by bathing for 18 months or more) """.
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's unlikely that this coronavirusbecause it's so easily transmittedwill disappear forever"" and could also ""become a seasonal disease, coming back every year""".
The return force will depend on the strong herd defence and the degree of adaptability
COVID-19 symptoms may be subtle and people who are infected may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, saliva and phlegm, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list of emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or depression, nausea, difficulty waking, and green face or lips; prompt medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Progression in these can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of those infected may not have symptoms, no medical symptoms but their test results confirm infection, so researchers have advised that those who have had close contact with those confirmed should be closely monitored and tested to ensure that they are not infected.
China's estimate of the symptom-free ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The typical incubation period (the period between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.To illustrate the uncertainty, estimates of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell initially were 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being discussed.
The disease is believed to be spread primarily through close contact and through small droplets that form when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; when close contact is at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 inches).
Studies have found that an uncovered cough can cause droplets to travel from a distance of up to 15 inches (4.5 m) to 28 inches (8.2 m).
Some have suggested that the virus may be transmitted by small, long-lasting droplets in the air, which may be present during speech.
Droplets may remain in the mouths or nostrils of people nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.
Other medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the airway to become inflamed and the resulting airway to become airborne.
It can also spread when someone touches an infected area, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread rapidly, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through oral contact after contact with human feces.The virus is most contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although spread can occur before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People are tested for the virus up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting transmission is possible before the development of major symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases have been confirmed by a laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracing investigations.
Although it is not clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others, says the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Specifically, the virus has been found to be present for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 on stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and steeped for up to four hours in mud.
This, however, varies depending on the temperature and humidity. Pets and other animals have been believed to be positively COVID-19 positive.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British guards recommend that people wash their hands after touching animals, as they do after touching areas that may have been touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three cases of pneumonia linked to a series of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in a manner related to the nature of coronaviruses.Outside the human body, the virus dies by its own skin, as it dissolves its outer defense.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is caused by the origin of the animal-to-animal transmission.
Genetic studies have revealed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the Betacoronavirus strain, both Sarbecovirus (lineage B) subtypes and to the bats.
It is 96% identical in all the genetic levels of other bat samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is a single amino acid difference in certain parts of the genetic sequence between the bacteria from pangolins and those from humans.
All genetic comparisons to date have found that there is approximately 92% genetic overlap between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Viral infection may in some cases be detected by observing symptoms, although certainty eventually comes from modifying the transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected feces or by CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although its precision is lower, as many of its images are grouped with other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used for diagnostic or primary diagnostic purposes for COVID-19""".
WHO has published several RNA test guidelines for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed with breath samples or blood.
Results are usually seen over a period of a few hours to days.
The test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab although a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing a natural swab, which is able to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been shown to be accurate enough to be authorised for universal use.
In the US the natural process test developed by Cellex is authorized for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of the image on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society has put together a worldwide online database of images of verified samples.
Due to the prevalence of other diseases such as adenovirus, photography without PCR confirmation is limited in its accuracy to identify COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although the image has a low degree of specificity in infection, it is fast and highly sensitive, which raises the possibility of consideration as a testing tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to be able to probe the features of viral images with both radiographs and CT.
Prevention measures include strict personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing with a tissue paper and putting the tissue paper directly in the bin.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to wear face coverings in public.
Social distancing measures have also been promoted to prevent transmission.Many governments have placed restrictions or warned against non-essential travel to or from countries affected by the epidemic.
Yet, the virus has reached a point of spreading to communities widely in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers caring for someone who may be infected are encouraged to use established precautions, such as contact monitoring, and eye protection.
The use of location data from cell phones by governments for this purpose has removed concerns about privacy rights, Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been installed or recommended for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log user proximity to other mobile phones.
Users can now receive a message when they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19.There are widespread misconceptions about ways to prevent infection; for example, cleaning the nose and coughing with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no cure for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to create one.
Hand washing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when their hands appear dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, because it blows up its defensive bubble.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume if soap and water are not available at the time.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a few solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chryohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a place such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, restrooms, common areas, public devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients, must be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or tissue when coughing, sneezing, or sneezing, and immediately discard any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since wearing a mask limits the amount and range of breathing droplets that come out when you speak, sneeze, and cough.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their faces, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene. ""Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for someone who may have the disease".
WHO has recommended that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing cloth masks instead of medical ones.China has specifically recommended that members of the public who are not sick use disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact (approximately 1 meter (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have officially banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a restaurant to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked passengers on trains and city buses to wear face masks by April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you go outdoors, while encouraging those who cannot afford to buy a face mask to make their own at home.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social isolation (also known as physical isolation) includes measures to control infection designed to slow the spread of disease by limiting close contact with people.
Measures include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
Individuals can use self-isolation measures by staying at home, limiting visits, avoiding crowded places, greeting without touching, and physically isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now enforcing or encouraging social distancing in those areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was suddenly reduced from 250 people (if there was no local spread of COVID-19) to 50, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, asthma, and weakened immune systems are at risk of severe illness and complications and the CDC has warned them to stay at home as much as possible in public areas with outbreaks. In late March 2020, WHO and other health departments began using the term 'physical isolation' to replace 'social isolation', making it clear that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social, online or face-to-face contact.
"The use of the term ""social isolation"" then leads to the conclusion that people should be fully engaged in social isolation, rather than encouraging them to continue contact with others in different ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health that can be applied during the pandemic".
These include encouragement to have sex only with a roommate, who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Isolation at home is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they may be infected.
Health authorities have issued extensive guidelines for proper quarantine, and many governments have imposed or encouraged quarantine on all those living in affected areas.
More stringent confinement guidelines have been passed by those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission are encouraged to quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling the epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Quarantine is followed in the early stages of the epidemic and the aim is to locate and isolate those infected and to introduce other infection control and treatment programmes to prevent the disease from spreading to other people.
If it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are then moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on health care practices and society.
Combining both the containment and mitigation measures may be pursued simultaneously.
Pressure requires very strong measures to delay the epidemic by reducing the simple birth rate to below 1. Part of managing an outbreak of an infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as breaking the epidemic line.
This reduces the risk of health services being found to be disrupted and allows more time for drugs and cures to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, self-isolation, public measures aimed at physical isolation such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; encouraging the public to accept and participate in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as sanitation.More stringent measures to contain the outbreak were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak was shared, such as complete closure of cities, and enforcement of laws protecting tourism.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced a public watch and imposed quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of those infected.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected with lockdown and imposed higher pay for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and imposed a penalty for the smuggling of medical supplies.A simulation of the situation in Great Britain and the United States shows that mitigation (to slow but not stop the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (to slow the spread of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Basic mitigation policies may reduce the heavy demand for health care by two thirds and death by half, yet the result is hundreds of thousands of deaths and the frustration of health systems.
The pressure may be better but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to circulate in human society (or until a cure is found, if that comes first), as transmission jumps fast when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the epidemic create social and economic costs.
There are no specifically approved drugs for COVID-19, but efforts to develop them are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking prescription medication, drinking fluids, and resting can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, treatment of respiratory, fluid inhalation, and respiratory support may be necessary.
Using steroids may reduce the effects.
Many compounds that have been approved for use in some emerging diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
"WHO also issued that some ""traditional and home remedies"" may provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19".
Raising capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is recommended by WHO as a critical response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and healthcare providers to move resources in different stages, including focusing laboratory activities on COVID-19 testing, cancelling preferential procedures where possible, screening and isolating confirmed COVID-19 patients, and enhancing critical care capacity by recruiting staff and increasing the number of respiratory and beds.
There are differing opinions as to where the first specimen (called the patient egg) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose slightly.
These were closely linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and the theory is that the virus originated from another species of these animals; or, in other words, it has a transmissible origin. A pneumonia strain of an unknown strain was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
"On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""".
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false gossip, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for sounding the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and reported to WHO.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported by Wuhan health authorities to withdraw the investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled at least every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, aided by transportation due to the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a major transportation and railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 cases in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people were already showing symptoms as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy in the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least 200 countries and territories have at least one example.
Due to the epidemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and have proposed border controls.
The national response includes containment measures such as confinement (also known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or lockdowns) and time limits.As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are under lockdown in the Philippines, at least 59 million people are under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are under lockdown in India.
By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggests that the first case was on 17 November.

"The Chinese National Health Commission began by asserting that there was ""no evidence"" of human-to-human transmission".
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a ""people's war"" to stem the spread of the virus".
"In what has been called ""the biggest lockdown in human history"", a sanitation line was announced on 23 January to block entry and exit from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 people".
Using your car was forbidden in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.

The Chinese government encouraged businesses and industries to reopen on 30 March, and provided companies with a large financial incentive.The State Council declared a three-minute fasting day starting at 10 a.m. on April 4, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to show their appreciation for the internet to monitor physical isolation and prevent a re-epidemic of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
State health officials reported a notable spike in confirmed cases on February 20, which is thought to be largely the result of a Daegu gathering of a new religious group known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of being the purveyors of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, among 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or at least 13% reported symptoms.South Korea declared a high-level warning on 23 February 2020.
By 28 February, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 by 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea have been closed after testing confirmed three soldiers with the disease.
South Korea has introduced what is considered the world's largest and most expertly organized population screening program, which isolates anyone infected and tracks and quarantines those who have been in contact with them.
The monitoring methods include compulsory self-reporting of symptoms to foreigners using a mobile phone system, passing-by virus testing when results are available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to allow 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's plan is considered a successful program in controlling the epidemic despite the complete closure of cities.South Korean society was initially divided in opinion when President Moon Jae-in responded to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed letters calling for an investigation into Moon after allegations that the government failed to handle the situation properly during the virus outbreak, and some have signed letters commending him for the measures he has taken.

The Shiite mosques in Qom remained open until 16 March 2020.In February, Iran became the epicenter of the virus outbreak, following China.
Allegations that Iran had reduced the actual number of cases to spread a false image prompted more than a dozen countries to investigate the origin of the disease, finding that the disease had already been reported in Iran on February 28, the day the Iranian government reported only 388 cases, which may indicate a much higher number than reported.
On March 3, the Iranian parliament was suspended after 23 of its 290 members were found to have the virus.

Later, another group of 16 COVID-19 cases were detected in a separate area, reports of which began to emerge on 21 February in Lombardy.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a formal announcement of measures to prevent the spread of the virus, which included the social isolation of more than 50,000 people infected in 11 cities in northern regions of Italy.
"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, ""No one will be allowed to enter or leave these areas with high levels of virus".

A CNN report suggested that the high number of elderly people and a lack of testing methods for those with the virus may be the cause of the rising death toll in Italy.
The response in the UK to the first outbreak was modest compared to other affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government had not made any plans to limit contact levels or to isolate those infected to prevent the spread of the disease.
As a result, the government has been criticized for not taking the issue seriously and for its response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an announcement about unnecessary travel and social contact, urging people to work from home if possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants, and theaters and cinemas.
On March 20, the government announced that recreational facilities such as bars and gyms would be closed immediately, promising to pay workers a wage of up to 80 percent but not more than 2,500 a month to prevent job losses during this period. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced that strict rules would be imposed on social contact, a complete ban on gatherings of more than two people, and a limit on unnecessary movement and outdoor activities.

On January 28, 2020, the U.S. government's leading medical agency, the Center for Disease Control, announced that it had developed a test kit for the virus.
Despite these measures, the United States was slow to implement a virus screening program, which made it difficult to determine the extent of the disease's spread.
The assessment of the spread of the disease was hampered by the lack of effective testing tools as those sent by the government office in February had died, the failure to obtain government approval to use testing tools from private organizations (such as research and educational institutions, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the conditions for testing people until early March (after which a doctor's prescription was required).

On April 3, the U.S. had a total of 884 deaths from the coronavirus in a 24-hour period.
In New York, the number of cases had exceeded 100,000 by April 3. The White House has been criticized for downplaying the virus and for influencing health ministry and scientific reports by directing health officials to cooperate with Vice President Mike Pence in issuing reports to the public about the virus.
The acceptance of the Trump-appointed team to lead in this crisis seems to be biased and supported by his party's supporters.
Some U.S. officials and media have criticized the United States for its overwhelming reliance on trade with China for basic necessities, including medical supplies.
The airway study was used to plan and predict the spread process and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

"WHO noted a difference between the 20022004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of covert action that caused difficulties in prevention and undermined containment efforts, and the current situation where the central government ""regularly provides updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays""".
"On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although this ""is by no means the WHO recommendation"", it is at the same time ""the most important decision to commit to contain the epidemic in its most concentrated area"" and called it ""unprecedented in the history of public health"".On 30 January, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the rise in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC measure since the 2009 swine flu outbreak was first recommended".
"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was due to ""the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems".
"In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros issued that ""there is no reason for measures affecting unnecessary international travel and trade"" and that ""WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement""".
"On 5 February, WHO appealed for $675 million from the international community to support a strategy of response for low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries ""who have no existing means of identifying people infected, or are likely to develop""."
"Tedros went on to recount that he suggested that ""we are only as strong as our weakest"" and urged the international community to ""invest today or pay more tomorrow"". On 11 February, WHO during a press conference stopped COVID-19 as a disease name".
"On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide ""the strength of the entire UN response process""".
"The UN Disaster Response Team was launched as a result, allowing for a United Nations-wide cooperative response, which WHO says will allow it to ""focus on health response while other representatives bring their expertise to the broader social, economic and development response presented by the outbreak""".
"On 14 February, a WHO-led Joint Task Force with China was launched to provide global and WHO experts with a base in China to assist in the response and manage the ""viral epidemic and transmission"" situation by opening workshops hosting workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions and conducting a yard visit program to assess ""the impact of response activities at regional and provincial levels, including urban and rural situations"". On 25 February, WHO stated that ""the world must do more to prepare for the potential coronavirus pandemic, reporting that while it is still very early to call it a pandemic, countries should be ""in the waiting phase"" but not yet in the testing phase".

The group stressed that a lack of energy or health insurance should never serve as an excuse to discriminate against a particular group.
Experts emphasize that everyone has the right to access health care, including the disabled, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, people in prison, and so on, refugees and other unidentified groups in need of government assistance.
National government agencies are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has set up a system to provide timely and comprehensive information on international legal responses worldwide, as well as opinions and advice.
From policies to strengthen global health and economic policy to addressing the effects of lockdowns and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a Country Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and intervene in coordinating global responses to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been heavily criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for their handling of the epidemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level Communist Party of China (CPC) officials were fired over their handling of the lockdown efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the way the political branch is responding to the outbreak in those areas.
Some analysts believe that the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian initially refused to acknowledge the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, preferring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 as originating in the U.S. or Italy.
"The U.S. administration of Donald Trump once called the coronavirus ""the Chinese virus"" and ""the Wuhan virus"" claiming that China's ""stealth policy has fueled a virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which in turn was criticized by some critics as racist ""and interfering with his administration's failure to contain the disease"."
"The Daily Beast obtained information from a U.S. diplomat who detailed a communication strategy apparently coming from the National Security Council, a strategy quoted as ""Everything is about China".
"We are told to try to get the message out by any means possible, including press conferences and TV appearances. ""News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have reported that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda effort to reach out to influence the world".
"EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is a ""spark of local politics combining a struggle for influence with a 'politics of openness'""."
"Borrell also said ""China is pushing the message strongly that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and trustworthy partner""".
China also advocated that the US lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, despite reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on 3 April.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting foreign aid destined for their country.
There have also been reports of masks being recalled in other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators that were being sent to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union for not being united with Italy while it was plagued by the coronavirus.
"Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said ""only China has responded directly".
"This is certainly not a good sign for European unity""
On March 22, after telephone contact with the prime minister of Italy, Russian president Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military medics, special antibacterial vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
"The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted a ""high-level political" source as saying that 80% of Russia's aid was ""little or no help to Italy"""
"The source accused Russia of running a campaign to make itself "politically popular"""
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, have condemned the media reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia once again sent a cargo-only plane to the United States with medical supplies
"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""if we accept help from our US partners, [Putin] is suggesting that US medical device manufacturers will be able to do the same for us if needed"""
"Scheduled NATO ""Defender 2020"" military exercises in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, which are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted at reduced scale".
"The Secretary General of The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 trial: ""Amid a public health crisis, not only the lives of soldiers from the US and other European allies but also the citizens of the countries where they serve are at risk. ""The Iranian government is under great pressure from the virus, with as many as 24 members of parliament infected and as many as 50 current or former politicians".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020, as his country struggles to combat the crisis due to the inability to access global markets caused by US sanctions against Iran.The crisis has led to recommendations for the United States to adopt more socially responsible policies like other wealthy nations, universal health care, childcare, employer-paid family leave and better public health support.
Political analysts expect it to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
"South Korea criticized Japan for ""fake detention efforts"" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be held for two weeks in government-designated detention facilities"
At first, the South Korean public was very divided on the president Moon Jae-in's reaction to the tragedy.
Many Koreans have signed petitions to remove Moon or praising his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to respond by passing disaster laws.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow prime minister Viktor Orban an indefinite mandate, with the power to suspend parliamentary and election proceedings and punish those who allegedly spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of it.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed on shortages of supplies due to increased use of equipment to combat the outbreak, rushed shopping and disruption in manufacturing and transportation.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of legal drugs and medical equipment due to high demand and disruption to retailers.
A few places have seen rushed purchases that have led to a rapid depletion of basic commodities such as food, toilet paper, and water supplies that have caused shortages of basic necessities
The technology industry has been warning about delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to prices rising by up to twenty times the normal purchase price and has caused delays in medical supplies of four to six months
It has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which the WHO warns puts the lives of medical workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has created a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This has led to a shortage of baby bottle food in some supermarkets which the Australian government has closed.Despite the high level of Covid-19 infection in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both areas have not experienced a severe food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the stockpiling and smuggling of essential commodities have been successful and prevented the expected food shortages in Europe and North America
Northern Italy and its abundant agricultural produce did not see a significant decline, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Food shelves were temporarily empty even in the city of Wuhan, and in China, government officials released pork stockpiles to ensure the nutrition of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food service providers to stockpile for emergencies.
The global economic damage was felt in China, according to media reports on 16 March 2020, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures taken to contain the spread of the virus, with retail purchases falling by 20.5%
With China a major economic and technological power, the virus outbreak has been viewed as a threat to global economic stability
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clear picture emerges of the potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts suggested that the economic impact of the pandemic on global economic growth could have exceeded that of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
One suggestion from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis provided a $300 billion impact on suppliers that could last two years.

Tourism is among the industries most affected by travel restrictions, closures of public places and tourist sites as well as government advisories against travel worldwide.
As a result, airlines have canceled flights due to declining demand including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas and the British airline Flybe has gone bankrupt.
The impact on the leisure shipping industry was unprecedented.
Some railway and ferry stations will be closed.
The outbreak coincided with Chunyu, the high tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
Many large-scale events have been canceled by national and regional governments including New Year celebrations and private companies are also closing shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar festivals and tourist sites have also been closed to prevent crowds including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional festivals at the Temples.
In provinces, municipalities, 24 of China's 31 provinces, authorities have extended the New Year holiday to 10 February, telling all workplaces not to open until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has raised the level of infectious virus response to the point where a state of emergency was declared, schools closed until March and New Year's celebrations canceled.
Shopping in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%

This resulted in a 33 to 43 percent drop in the number of people visiting supermarkets in March compared with February.
Mall owners around the world have set new targets, such as water cleaning and installation of thermal scanners. to monitor temperature in consumers and to cancel events. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America believes the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may leave 14 to 22 million people more vulnerable than they would have been without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the estimated 300 million migrant workers are trapped in their homes in the central provinces or trapped in the Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus pandemic may have cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32% according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian wage workers without work. A study by the Angus Rei Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have been affected by unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers in Spain lost their jobs since the country's lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary benefits and 1 million British workers for a universal credit scheme. About half a million companies in Germany have transferred workers to a government-sponsored part-time program called Kurzarbeit.
This German system of reduced hours has been adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and culture industries have been significantly affected by the pandemic disrupting the functioning of organizations and individuals - employed and private - worldwide
Arts and cultural organisations have tried to promote their programmes, often government-sponsored, to open up spaces to the public and keep their staff and the public safe and to support the heroes.
Then in March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, theatres and cultural venues were closed indefinitely, with archery and sporting events cancelled or postponed.
One of the newest and fastest-growing changes is the cancellation of religious, sports, and other social events such as festivals and concerts and technology and fashion conferences.

The health ministry in Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and closed places of worship while in Saudi Arabia foreign believers and local residents were banned from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the greatest disruption to worldwide sports programs since World War II.
Many major tournaments have been postponed or cancelled altogether, including the 2019 to 2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019 to 2020 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019 to 2020 NBA Season and the 2019 to 2020 NHL season.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games ""will be rescheduled for the post-2020 season but not later than summer 2021"".Casinos and other sports venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments postponed or cancelled".
This has led to online gambling, with many gambling sites reporting a sharp increase in signups. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with bands cancelling or cancelling concert tours.
Many plays, such as those on Broadway, have all the shows cancelled.
"Some artists have explored ways to continue recording and sharing their work on the internet instead of performing live as usual, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""events"" for artists to perform, broadcast and publicize their work".
Many memes about the coronavirus have spread online as many turn to jokes and distractions amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID -19, a high level of discrimination, racism and racial bias has been noted against people of Chinese and East Asian origin and against people from certain parts of Europe , the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February, when most cases were within China's borders, noted racial sentiments expressed by various groups around the world that the Chinese people deserved the virus or received what is called a deserved retribution.
Other African countries have seen an increase in hostility toward the Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their geographical origin
There has been Chinese support both on social media and in person for those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the outbreak to other countries, people in Italy, the first European country to have a serious outbreak of Covid-19, may face accusations and racial discrimination.Residents of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have begun signing petitions in conjunction with campaigns to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.

Testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus as well as those that detect antibodies produced as a result of infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR detecting the presence of coronavirus RNA.
This study was specifically designed to test RNA for the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a diagnosis of a recent or ongoing illness.
Antibody detection, serology, can be used for both human disease testing and public health surveillance.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have had the disease in the past, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who had no symptoms at all.
An accurate estimate of the mortality rate and the overall infection rate can be obtained from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing numbers, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable statistics on the rate of spread of the virus in their communities.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are wide variations in the number of tests carried out between countries.
These differences may have a major impact on the reported death rates, which may be exaggerated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, rRt-PCR, this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained from various sources, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are usually seen within two hours to two days.
A so-called RT-PCR test with throat swabs can be relied upon only in the first week of the disease.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continue to spread in the lungs.
For infected individuals who are tested in the second week, some sample material can be removed from the depths of the olfactory canal with a suction catheter or by coughing up material, sputum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR assays were developed at Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, irRT-PCR, forming the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Cogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARSCoV-2 test kit that is clinically viable on 28 January 2020.
"It detects the same ""E gene"" in all beta coronaviruses and the RDRp gene found only in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the companies that received emergency approval from China's National Products Administration to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is distributing the 2019-Novel Coronavirus, 2019-Novel, Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to clinical testing facilities through the International Reagent Resource".
Three genetic tests on older test kits produced ambiguous results due to ineffective reagents and tight testing at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of fewer than 100 successful samples per day throughout February 2020.
Testing using two-part testing was not found to be unreliable until 28 February 2020 and until then provincial and local testing centres were allowed to start testing.
The test method was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. Independent testing centers began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing
Quest Diagnostics has also made COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020
No statistical limitations have been announced, and collection and digestion of specimens should be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, testing for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On 12 March 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19 management.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours, thus allowing one machine to perform 4128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency approval to Abbott Laboratories, USA, to test on the Abbott m2000 standard, the FDA had previously granted similar approvals to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received an EUA through the FDA for a test duration of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and heat cycles, this type can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase its production to 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically attached to a nucleocapsid protein, the N protein, for the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes similar to a flu test.
"A March 2020 literature review concluded that ""chest radiographs are of little help in the early stages and CT scans, computed tomography, may be available before symptoms begin to appear".
Common features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacifities with periheral, asymmetricand posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation increase as the disease changes.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan at the outbreak site suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR but lacks specificity, many of its features being associated with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT not be used to screen or test for COVID-19 for the first time"" As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for the first time"""
Part of the immune response to disease management is the production of antibodies including Igm and Gg.
These can be used to test for the presence of disease from 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, to determine infectivity and community surveillance.Assays can be performed by primary testing centers, CLTs, or by point-of-care testing, PoCT.
The high level of automated systems in many medical laboratories will be able to work with assays but their availability will depend on the speed of their production.
With CLT, only one peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although serial samples can be used for immune response.
With PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by scratching the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a pre-testing step is not required.On 26 March 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 agencies that reported to the agency as necessary and are now able to distribute their own antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test is FDA-approved under the Critical Condition Authorization.In late March 2020, Euroiminium Medical Laboratory and Epitome Diagnostics received approval for its European test kits that can test for IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is a few hundred samples per hour so it is much faster than the conventional PCR assay for Viral RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually tested 14 days after diagnosis. In April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased could be used to any advantage.
"Hong Kong has introduced a system where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a specimen tube"", to spit in, return it and get results after a while.The British NHS has announced that it is launching a home testing programme to eliminate the threat of a patient infecting others when going to the clinic or the need to disinfect the patient's vehicle if it has been used.For suspected patients in COVID-19 testing facilities, the healthcare provider will collect samples using appropriate sanitation".
The drive-through centers have helped South Korea to make the fastest, most focused testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians spoke on 2 March, saying it had the capacity to handle about 12,000 tests a day through the upgrade program and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the examination is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to handle 160,000 tests a week.
Starting on 19 March, a drive-through inspection was offered in many major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests carried out by Germany was unknown, as only accurate results were reported.
"The initial laboratory test showed that from calendar week 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples were ((6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a test method for testing 64 patient samples once, combining samples and further testing only when the combined sample showed confirmation".In Wuhan a 2,000-square-meter emergency laboratory test facility called ""Yan-Huo"" (Chinese text: 火眼, or ""Yam"" in English) was opened by the BGI in February 2020, with the capacity to test more than 50,000 samples".
With the facility now being managed by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasting 5 days, the simulation shows that samples in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the appropriate cost to meet the lockdown would have been doubled if the capacity to contain the test had not been available on time.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by the Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily transmission is 50,000 tests per day.The open source, complex diagrams released by Origami Assays are open to allow testing of up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assays.These sophisticated measurement diagrams can be run in small laboratories without the need for fluid-capturing robots.
Since March, shortages and insufficient reagent quantities have become a minor factor in the majority of tests in the EU and UK as well as the US.
This led some authors to investigate sample preparation procedures involving heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA molecules for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing its population for more Coronavirus per capita than any other country, and was on a good footing in increasing the testing rate to reach a larger proportion of the population.
"This was a combination of containment-driving capacity, and the purchase of a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world's first of this level to be operational outside China.
Different testing methods for different coronavirus genes are being developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose the German method of manufacturing kits for export to poor countries that do not have the resources to manufacture their own.
The German procedure was published on 17 January 2020; the policy developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying testing already available in the U.S. China and the United States faced reliability problems with testing kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to develop and produce enough kits to meet the demand and motivation of health professionals.
In contrast, experts say widespread testing availability in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The capacity to contain tests, especially in private laboratories, was developed over a period of years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for strengthening testing procedures as the best way to slow the introduction of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the extent of the virus spread caused a workload buildup of hundreds of thousands in private U.S. laboratories, and the release of swabs and chemical reagents was pressured.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of its testing kits.
"In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC were found to be ""defective"";"" the government removed legal barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate".
The company explained that the erroneous results may be due to misjudgments of sample collection or proper use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the kits that showed erroneous results, and replace them with special kits supplied to Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China produced erroneous results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be disposed of by placing them in the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the test kits Turkey purchased from China were found to have ""high error rates"" and were not ""used"". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced that they were not usable".
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and followed up with those who had contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the results were also positive.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of a total of 3,400 people, with at least ten days of isolation.
At least half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all samples were sealed.
Since visits are limited, this eliminates new infections altogether.
With the most affected countries actively tracking, inbound travel restricted, testing, and lockdowns, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore proceeded more slowly than in other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and other retail outlets.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holiday break on 23 March.
Several countries have also managed to manage the epidemic with vigorous contact tracing, restricted internal travel, screening, and quarantine, but to a lesser extent in lockdown, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have found that countries that are more sensitive, in comparison with the death rate, have lower mortality rates, which may be due to the fact that they are in a better position to investigate those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to contain testing and have national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send the first five and the last 10 confirmed COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 trusted WHO laboratories to validate testing.
Of the 16 trusted laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column Convincing % of testing is influenced by national testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have more confirmed test percentages than a country that tests all its citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other things being equal.
Handwashing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of rinsing hands to remove dirt, grease, small objects, or unwanted dirt.
Washing hands with soap and soap regularly during those "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral tract.
People can also contract respiratory diseases such as a common cold or flu, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the lining of the mouth).
Five critical times during the day when handwashing with soap is important include: before and after unwashing, after cleaning a baby's nails or changing a baby's nappies, before feeding a baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash hands with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a bathroom or cleaning a child's toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices that are associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical assistance can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of hand hygiene is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or who work in the medical field, but it is an important procedure even in the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases;
and reduce the rate of infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing practices may result in a small improvement in the developmental rate of children under five.
In developing lands, the rate of death among young people from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
A simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by about 50 percent.
Interventions that encourage handwashing with soap can reduce episodes of diarrhea by three times, and this can be compared to providing clean water in economically deprived areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrheal episodes can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as is a common behavioural practice in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading cause of A.R.I., is the leading cause of death in infants under five years of age, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both contribute to the deaths of about 3.5 million infants each year.
According to UNICEF, making it a regular practice to wash hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet could save more lives than any single remedy or medical intervention, cutting the death rate from diarrhea by about half and from respiratory diseases by one half.
Handwashing is usually combined with other waste-disposal interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) systems.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo from being transmitted by direct contact.
The minor risk arising from regular hand washing is skin damage caused by dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand hygiene can result in itching, a skin condition known as hand eczema, or hand dermatitis, which is more common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of infection through the oral system: after using the toilet (urinating, flushing), after washing the baby's gums (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating or before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand hygiene procedures should be followed to prevent transmission of disease include before and after handling a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after handling animal waste or handling animals; and after handling litter.
In many countries, there is a low standard of handwashing with soap.
A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households follow a handwashing routine with soap.A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%, the United States the near-medium rate of 77% and China the lowest rate of 23%.A few practices are now in place to increase acceptance of handwashing with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" initiated by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a statistical action to promote children's health and education.
Disinfection twice a year, along with regular hand washing with soap, daily fluoride brushing, is a pillar of the national system.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is also best done with soap or detergent.
The main function of soap and detergents is to reduce the blocking agents, and to increase the solubility.
Water alone is not enough to cleanse the skin because oils and proteins, which are the building blocks of soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
But cleaning is aided by flowing water to a certain extent.
A soap bubble, because it can be recycled, may retain the remaining bacteria from the previous process.
A small number of studies that looked at transmission from infected to infected mosquitoes concluded that it is impossible as the bacteria are washed away along with the foam.
The CDC also adds that "liquid soap and hand-free control are better".
Antibacterial soaps are widely advertised by members of the health-care community.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of the proposed antiseptics or disinfectants favors natural antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a long list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
Besides the surfactant and protective agent, complex structures may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin care products (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). An extensive study from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that sterile soaps are as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan at eliminating and protecting bacteria from the gut.
Hot water that you can use to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria thrive when the temperature of the chamber is ~37 °C.
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils that clog soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the load of germs on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a substitute for water-free hand hygiene.
In the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Many are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that has been mixed with a moisturizer such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) to make a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to make a liquid, or a foam to make it easier to use and to reduce the alcohol's thirst.
Adding hydrogen peroxide to the liquid enhances the antimicrobial activity even more. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are effective at killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers with 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 logs per drop, equivalent to 35 decibels per drop) of bacteria on the hands within 30 seconds after applying and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 logs per drop) of bacteria on the hands within 1 minute after applying.
Hand sanitizers made with alcohol are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) bacteria, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Adequate hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to soften completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the inside and ends of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand hygiene instead of hand sanitizer, especially when it is obvious that the hands are dirty.
The advantage in using these agents is due to their ease of use and quick ability to kill microorganisms; however, they should be used instead of proper hand sanitizers unless soap and water are not available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the mixture.
The alcohol dehydration process can be slowed or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or emollients to the mixture.
In medical studies, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with emollients made the skin more prone to itching and dryness than soap or detergents with antimicrobial agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
The low incidence of irritant contact dermatitis is attractive compared with handwashing with soap and water.
Regardless of their function, waterless hand sanitizers cannot wash hands from natural materials, but simply kill germs.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and mixtures, and they have historically been more effective than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, additives using benzalkonium chloride have shown a persistent and increased antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease efficacy after repeated application, may be the cause of persistent skin reactions.
Many people in poor communities cannot afford soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that contamination of soil or ash with microorganisms may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also an antibacterial agent because when mixed with water, it forms an alkaline mixture.
WHO recommends ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
Proper hand hygiene recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is encouraged because standing water may be contaminated, and the temperature or coldness of the water does not make a difference.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with a sufficient amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap raises bacteria on the skin, and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands thoroughly when soap is available than when using water alone.
Lie down for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes heat, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and long rubbing removes more bacteria.
Rinse thoroughly under running water.
Washing a basin may get your hands dirty
Dry them with a clean towel or let them dry in the air.
Wet, damp hands absorb dirt easily - easily forgotten areas of the thumb, the groin, the interdigits, and under the nails.
Flexible nails and corroded nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Wet washes are commonly recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Different low-cost systems can be developed to meet hand sanitization when tap water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water by hanging a container or drum with the proper holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries. In situations with limited water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-taps" and other forms of cost-saving.
Tip-tap is a simple technique that uses a drum with a string attached, a foot lever that pours a little water into the hands, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is controversy about the most effective method of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are better for hygiene than the electric air dryers found in laundry facilities.
In 2008, a study led by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a paper towel industry, compared the hygiene standards of paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and the latest air dryers.
After cleaning and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to be on average higher on finger pads by 194% and on the palms of the hands by 254%.
Instant air drying was successful in increasing the total number of bacteria on finger pads by 42% and on the palms of the hands by 15%.
After cleaning and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of viruses decreased on average on the finger pads by 76% and on the palms of the hands by up to 77%.The scientists also took a test that could reveal if there was a possibility of infection from users of the toilet and toilet as a result of each drying procedure.
The air dryer, which blows air out at a rated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), successfully defused the hand and hand with microorganisms and nearly infected other users and the cleaning area up to six feet [2 m] away.
The use of hot air has spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study led by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt tested different hand dryers.
The following change in the number of bacteria after hand drying was observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Handwashing with hand sanitizer is another option when traveling without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was made mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (1846) in preventing disease in the hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide a reminder to hospital workers to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found a decrease in disease rates by its effectiveness.
Medical handwashing is 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to rub or rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on the hands, it is important to clean them thoroughly and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to seal the water (and open any exit doors if possible).
This avoids re-dusting your hands with such items.
The purpose of handwashing in a healthcare setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that neglect of handwashing continues at unacceptable rates in many medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that regular hand hygiene and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a white paper outlining a policy for hand hygiene and hand rubbing in the health care field.
The organization's updated hand hygiene guidelines can be found on its Web site for public comment.
A review that should have been directed by Whitby et al.
Shopping appliances can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration and compliance with the law is required.
The World Health Organization has "five times" to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/blood fluid
before aseptic operation, and
Putting a chemical in the nose ("medicated" or "antibacterial") gives the hand sanitizer a more lethal effect.
Such lethal force may be needed before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms abound. To 'rub' someone's hands for the purpose of surgery, a hand-free tap, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile hand dryers after cleaning, and a sterile toothbrush and other sterile instrument for cleaning under the nails are needed.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires hand and arm washing up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of brushing (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When moving, the water in the arms must be prevented from running back into the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth or surgical cloth is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand hygiene comes from the first 20% of cleaning, and that the additional benefit is much less when hand-washing is increased by more than 35%.
Comparing hand-rubbing with an alcohol-based solution and hand-rubbing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs in reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating workers on hand hygiene, recommending the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to investigate which of these interventions works best in different health-care settings.
In developing lands, handwashing with soap is recognized as an economical, vital tool for achieving good health, even physical nutrition.
Yet, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or hand sanitizers in private homes, schools, and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve global hand-washing practices.
For example, in many rural parts of Africa, hand sanitizers near private or public toilets are scarce, despite cheap ways to build hand sanitizers.
However, low handwashing rates may be more likely to be the cause of entrenched habits than lack of soap or water.
Advertising and advocating for handwashing with soap can influence legal decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a change in the prevailing social mores.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and tracking are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in promoting handwashing in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective.One example of school handwashing advertising is UNICEF's "Three Star Method" which encourages schools to take simple, cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one and eventually to three stars.
Building hand sanitizers can be part of a campaign to reduce infant illness and death.
World Hand Sanitation Day is one example of vigilance campaigns that attempt to achieve a change in habits.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the widespread use of hand sanitization emoji.
A few studies have considered the overall cost of hand sanitization in developing countries and the relationship to the prevention of DALYs.
Yet, one review suggests that advertising handwashing with soap saves far more than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand hygiene for human health  especially for vulnerable people such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis of Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English "father of modern nursing".
At that time many people still believed that diseases were caused by odors called miasmas.
In the 1980's, foodborne outbreaks and medical-related illnesses led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote handwashing more as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against this type of infectious disease.
For example, posters with the words "proper handwashing procedure" are hung near the sink in public toilets and restrooms in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "clean your hands" of something, means to make it clear that you do not want someone to take responsibility for or be involved in something.
It originates in the Bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands in making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a common phrase in some English-speaking societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth first forced herself to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of the supposed filth, which represents a guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after recalling or thinking about wrong actions, are more likely to wash their hands several times more than others, and they are more likely to appreciate the importance of hand sanitizers.
Furthermore, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to share in regretful "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
The religion promotes hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. The symbolic practice of hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing practice that exists in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace controls for the risk of COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace risk controls are the use of occupational safety and health risk management procedures to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the nature of the work, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have a low level of social contact with other workers, for which simple precautions are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, good breathing habits, and maintaining a workplace sanitation and disinfection system.
Moderate-risk occupations include those that require frequent and close contact with people who are unknown or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have the virus due to ongoing community transmission or travel abroad.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as schools, crowded workplaces, and crowded sales areas.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing guards, and having personal protective equipment available in cases where a person is diagnosed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and refrigeration workers who are exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which raises the risk of exposure even higher if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures, or retrieve or handle specimens from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include building controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and appropriate personal protective equipment at work.
the outbreak of*COVID-19 can have severe consequences in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of exposure.
Retailers' habits may change, both in the type of goods demanded, and in the means of procuring these goods (such as shopping during off-peak hours or by delivery or by driving passes).
Finally, shipments from areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive actions.
The programs consider the levels of hazards involved in different workplaces and types of work, including the type of exposure, hazards that arise at home or in social situations, and individual hazards of workers such as advanced age or chronic illness.
They also outline appropriate controls to meet such hazards, and the following plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparation for and response to an infectious disease may depend on national or provincial legislation.
The objectives of response to an outbreak include reducing staff turnover, protecting people at high risk of serious health problems, maintaining business operations, and mitigating the impact on other businesses and suppliers.
The severity of the disease in the business community affects the response measures taken.
Risk control ladders are a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to link risk controls with outcomes.
When the risks of COVID-19 are not eliminated, the most effective controls are building controls, followed by management controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Construction controls involve isolating workers from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and they can be a very cost-effective measure when installed.
Controls to manage changes in labour law or procedures requiring employee or employer action
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than building and management controls, but it can help to avoid some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the worker's risk, worn appropriately as appropriate (e.g., respirators), worn regularly and in the proper manner, checked regularly, stored, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure jobs have less contact with the community and other peers.
Simple prevention measures recommended at all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, good breathing habits including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissue and container materials, preparing for homework or alternate shifts as needed, encouraging workers to avoid using other people's tools and equipment, and continuing to maintain a cleanliness and disinfection process at the workplace.
Quick detection and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, builders, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or symptom-modifying medications, and that rules on sick days be flexible, allow workers to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these rules.
According to OSHA, moderate-exposure occupations include those occupations that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of strangers or suspected COVID-19 patients, who have SARS-CoV-2 virus due to ongoing transmission in the community near the workplace, or because someone has recently returned from a foreign country that is a hotbed for COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers with high exposure to the general public such as schools, crowded workplaces, and high-risk retail environments.Construction of controls for these high-risk groups includes installing low-performance air filters, raising ventilation levels, installing restrictions such as plastic sneezing monitors, and installing a drive-through window for customer service.Management of this high-risk workgroup includes encouraging sick workers to stay at home, installing a virtual communication system that can be used in face-to-face meetings, cleaning contaminated toilets, coordinating critical travel to COVID-19-affected areas, and providing customers with a personal or professional contact plan that includes training on how to use face masks, face protection, face protection, face protection, and other safety measures, including training on COVID-19 safety, personal or workplace safety, and providing workers with access to safety equipment, face protection, face protection, and other safety measures, and training on how to protect themselves from the risks of COVID-19.
Workers in this exposure group rarely need to use respirators.
If someone becomes ill on board, appropriate control measures for staff and other passengers include isolating the sick person from others at a distance of six feet, assigning one crew member to care for the sick person, and providing a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated areas, and additional protective equipment may be needed if the patient has a fever, a persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk management includes postponing travel if sick, isolating and informing the medical center immediately if someone starts to have a fever or other symptoms while on board.
If possible, medical follow-up should take place in a person's isolation cabin.In school and kindergarten areas, the CDC recommends temporary closures for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been inside the school premises regardless of the spread.
If there is mild to moderate infection in the community, isolation strategies may be implemented such as cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings such as environmental education, choir classes or eating out at cafeterias, increasing space between desks, arrival and departure times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office area for children with flu-like symptoms.
When the virus is spreading significantly in the community, despite efforts to distance oneself, extended school closures may be considered. For law enforcement personnel who are engaged in daily activities, the health risk at that time is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement personnel who must contact people who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical personnel, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact when a person is found, workers should clean and disinfect their work belts and clothing before reusing them with a spray or household cleaner, and follow standard procedures for preventing the spread of the virus and disposing of used PPE and storing and washing clothes.
OSHA considers that some medical and refrigeration workers are at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk occupations include medical delivery, first aid, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who have been exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are the greatest risks of exposure if workers perform procedures that create aerosols, or collect or handle samples, from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Procedures that produce aerosols include tubal ligation, cough procedures, bronchoscopies, dental procedures and examinations, or collection of body samples.
High-risk cold-exposure operations include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with known or suspected COVID-19 incidents when they die; these become particularly high risk when they examine cadavers.Additional controls for engineers of these risk groups include quarantine rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when performing aerosol induction procedures.
Special ventilation at high pressure may be appropriate in some medical and refrigeration settings.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 safety guidelines.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that arriving patients be isolated and placed in separate waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from known, or suspected, patients with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filter-respirators or better must be used as part of a comprehensive respirator protection program, which includes physical examination, exercise, and medical examination.
Some types of respirators can be more protective and improve worker comfort.WHO does not recommend covers, because COVID-19 is a disease that is transmitted by inhalation rather than by body fluids.
WHO recommends surgical masks only for personnel filtering at entry points.
For those who collect sniff samples, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol dispensing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, goggles, or face shields, gowns, and gloves.
In the case of aerosol manufacturing, a surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because there is insufficient PPE in the world, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE by telephone patient contact, physical barriers such as window displays, allowing only those directly involved in the treatment to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for a specific job, continuing to use the same respirator without removal while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and controlling the availability of PPE, and prohibiting the use of masks for people without symptoms.

We find ourselves in a remarkable situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of how interconnected the world is and how we are responsible for one another.
We have never faced such challenges, but we know that our response depends on the kind of compassion, cooperation, and community building that is the backbone of this organization.
The cooperation and care we have seen from all our employees through e-mails, phone calls, and conversations is a remarkable proof that we have good people with whom we are fortunate to work.
I am truly happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
It reminded me how logical it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful sign of this important resource to remain online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep sites open or our employees paid or our communities safe.
The world needs information available on Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a powerful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make major changes in the way we work together, starting next week.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss how we would work with our schedule for the coming days and months.
During that discussion, we considered what we felt would be the best response to our situation and the best way to keep the organization moving during this time.
We may expect to be relieved of stress and to support our long-term goal.
If you need to call us again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and contractors:
our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not advertise vacation - if you can work regular overtime, the company can hire you.
However, things are uncertain in the world today, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for food, or seek medical attention, your health is our priority.
It will not keep track of your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
We don't really need to say this, but we will.
You don't have to put in sick days or PTO - you just tell your manager and help your team to rearrange calendars and schedules to ensure that key parts of the job are done.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please notify Bryan within T&C Ops so that T&C can help by supporting and ensuring that your condition is properly managed by the administration).
Workers who work full hours will be paid full wages.
We have already said, and we are doing, that we fulfill our obligations to our contractors and those who work overtime.
Each will be paid according to his normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve stress and to adjust to the environment.
Our efforts can be rewarded in a unique way, especially at times like this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your manager, so that we can learn what to expect and plan accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all departments to review current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our goal.
We will all have much to do, and we will all just focus on the more important projects.
Slowing down now will not hurt us later.
We don't sit around working overtime to keep up with the schedule when the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to finish the job at an unusual time now.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and times where appropriate.
What happened to APP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to our new circumstances and the expected daily work hours, we intend to change the delivery period of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our aim is to suggest an extension of our 2019-2020 schedule that allows more time to create a budget to allow employees to do critical tasks first, take care of themselves, and take care of their loved ones while also helping those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule in the next few weeks.
This extension of the working period greatly reduces the work now scheduled and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and review the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the APP team for leading in this.
Office environment, exposure, and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our SF employees may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of deep concern, we sent a disinfection team to disinfect all areas of the San Francisco office.
Use hospital disinfectant soap to disinfect everything, including the reception area and elevator entrances.
The building implements its maintenance protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel relieved that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees in DC.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to a fully-equipped remote location in accordance with the guidance given by San Francisco.
As some of our NYC employees knew, we had been discussing renting a property in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may take time.
Some of our employees are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote workers know that it can be a big change, and they want to give you some advice:
Reduce the length of the meetings to at least one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how you can divide them over several days.
Clearly explain the subject of the meeting, have an agenda, and send the material in advance.
Do it with video, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to work and communicate live.
Have someone take the lead in organizing all the meetings, someone look at the questions in the discussions and follow up on the list of speakers, and someone help to take notes (or take notes together).
Email technical support if you need a suitable headset.
Spend your welfare money on chewing gum.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss assignments with colleagues
The HR Operations team seeks guidance from online seminars on effective work practices to support the increase in workloads across the Company.
Last week we asked all donors to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as editathons, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We will let them know that we understand that our request to cancel and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their agreed-upon royalty payments and that no one will be fined for delay or change of such terms.
This coming week we will follow up with another guide to Wikimania and other regional and regional community conferences.
The general public sentiment around the world seems to be depressed about the disruption but relieved by the clarification and opportunities to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and so on.
In time, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a community space to view contributions and follow our discussions with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related news
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share some updates, answer your questions, and spend some time communicating.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email, and all other important COVID-19 related information, on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We also work to maintain regular contact with workers living in countries currently most affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the route of a major project, a college challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We are here to help support and communicate when needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be viewed as a resignation from our work and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition that in this time, our work and responsibilities will likely need to be balanced as never before.
These are steps we believe are necessary to support each other to keep the work going, to provide our team with the support it needs, and to provide the world with a service it relies on.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
In the meantime, it is time to support one another and to create a space for valuable activity that may exist in the weeks and months ahead.
We need all of you to make that happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you are fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that resides on the outer (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (((1-7) making it a promising drug for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-stranded type I membrane protein, whose domain is activated by enzymes that are exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by an enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually into the urine.
ACE2 is present in many tissues: ACE2 is bound to the cell membrane of primarily type II alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE balance.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and then divides it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also secrete several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the movement of the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point to certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the association of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV2 in the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the migration of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes between cells.
This entry process also requires activation of the S protein by the serine protease TMPRSS2, an inhibitor currently under investigation as a potential treatment for the disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight the virus.
However, many leading organizations and working groups have advocated continuing with the standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A planned review and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% greater reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls"""
"Furthermore, ""the risk of pneumonia has been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart disease".
"The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease in the number of patients dying from pneumonia, although the effects were less severe than the damage that can be caused by pneumonia".
Human gene ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for severe lung injury, and it appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics for oxygen depletion in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Half of rhACE2 in humans takes 10 hours to activate and begins to activate 30 minutes after the 24-hour period.
Some studies suggest that rhACE2 may be an appropriate treatment for those who cannot take common renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which the precursor angiotensin II is elevated.
"The b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help you get numbers about the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, such as a process to identify people (""contacts"") who may have been in contact with an infected person".
Several programs have been developed or even considered, with governmental support in some areas.
Framework for building touch-based search apps have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems based on tracking the location of app users.
Other techniques that do not require confidential information include the use of Bluetooth signals to locate the user on other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would develop a way to support such Bluetooth apps directly on Android and iOS OSes.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
In China, it is used in more than 200 cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The app was developed by local IT professionals, released as an open vaccine and will be provided by the government.In North Macedonia, ""StopKorona!"", a Bluetooth-based app was released to track exposure to people who may have the virus and provide a quick response to health authorities".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government said the tracking app was in the advanced stages of development, and would be available for release in a few weeks. A similar app is being prepared in Ireland, and France (""StopCovid"")".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to launch a screening app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they stay indoors.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has listed several potential problems with app systems, including misleading alerts and the possibility of not receiving an alert if the app's capabilities are limited to a small number of people.
"To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has placed limits on the types of organizations that can install coronavirus apps on its App Store, saying only those that are ""legal"" or trusted".
Google and Amazon have established similar limits.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the problems of crowd tracking using coronavirus apps, especially about the fact that the tracking system developed to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be broken once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement that placed limits on this type of stalking.
These organizations have set nine criteria for government projects:
"the search must be ""lawful, necessary and appropriate"";"
the extension of the surveillance and search period shall be subject to sunset conditions;
data use will have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity will need to be protected and shown to be protected based on evidence;
digital testing will have to avoid reducing the harmfulness of discrimination and downplaying the value of things;
any sharing of data with others will be legally defined;
there will be a vigilance against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
"effective participation by all ""stakeholders"" will be required, including public health professionals and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also issued checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple system aims to fix the problem of constant tracking by disabling the tracking function from the device's OS when it is no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location-tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and avoid being tracked.
In Israel, network-based tracking was authorized.
Network-based solutions that have access to unfiltered location data can have serious privacy problems.
However, not all systems with large servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been developed using large servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track a person.
Instead of using a designated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card purchase data, and combines this to send notifications via text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to alert people who may have the virus, the government also made local information available to the public, which is allowed because of many changes in privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
Countries including Germany are considering using both large and private systems to protect privacy.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protected tracking is a well-designed technique, with extensive research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than 12 expert groups were looking for privacy-aware solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a networking effort that contains both large and diverse protocols, and is not a single protocol.Various protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, FKA Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, the physical person data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or data as a shortcut to tracking the spread of COVID-19.
"Based on research from the white paper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic"" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company first developed at the MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and law enforcement, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was formed by groups united by what were common principles and widely differing protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing for the global usability of tracking and alerting apps, a key factor in widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it was launching an invitation for the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a tracking system, and claimed that it would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published technical features of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three phases:
release of tools to allow governments to create legal privacy-protecting coronavirus tracking apps
installing this feature directly on the iOS and Android systemsGoogle and Apple to fix startup problems and continuous monitoring by first sending the system with OS updates, and then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the reuse of an approved drug to treat another disease or health condition that is different from the one for which it was designed.
This is the kind of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug-positive proteins, each with multiple molecular assembly sites.
Analysis of these combination sites led to a realistic project to develop an antiviral against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important targeted proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are proteases such as papain, RNA-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, and others researched several potential drugs and then developed and analyzed their structural similarity with similar high-level authorized drugs to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 drug in this preclinical study that could be used as a research drug.
Chloroquine is a drug for treating malaria that is also used for certain immune system disorders.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being investigated as part of the Combined Clinical Trials.
New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State's testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA's medical research process and is only authorized under the EUA as an investigational treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but who cannot accept treatment in medical research.
"The CDC said ""the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine in prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus"" is not appropriate".
"Doctors said they used medicine when ""there was no other option""".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major research is underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting research on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for disease prevention.
"Chinese medical research in Wuhan and Shenzhen says favipiravir appears to be ""really effective""".
35 patients in Shenzhen were found to have the disease in a 4-day period, while the duration of the illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence available to support the drug is limited and not yet effective.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan and stockpile it, and use the military to ship the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has introduced himself to Trump's council about buying a drug. The drug may not work completely in severe cases where the virus has replicated.
It may not be safe to use in pregnant women or when trying to conceive.
"One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ""no benefit was found""".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a fluid that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are critics in the scientific community for directing efforts to reuse drugs specifically designed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the Joint Global Study.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a drug for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg diseases. Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against philo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona-virus.
One problem with antibiotics is the development of a mutation therapy that can lead to more serious, infectious disease.
Preliminary research suggests that remdesivir may have a high genetic inhibitor in the drug's effectiveness. Several clinical studies are ongoing, including two conducted at Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate disease and one for people with severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C injections for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two counterfeit drugs (in China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (in Italy).
The State of New York began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used in the treatment of patients, and it even led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
A multi-center study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in the prevention and treatment of disease was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists have focused on reusing antibiotics developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with schedule 7 of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with schedule 7 of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been found to be reusable in treating COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): It is approved in China.
Also in the Italian and Chinese studies. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no goal has completed medical research, there are many ongoing efforts to develop such a goal.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I of the safety study in April.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread worldwide in 2020, leading to a massive fundraising and research effort to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use genes to develop manufactured vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
Since April, the key elements of CEPI's vaccine development work are accelerated, rolled out, manufactured, and accessible to the world.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms had been researched and developed by early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform functions that evolved in Phase I safety research include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (initiator of Phase I and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (initiator of Phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, while 78 have been confirmed as viral projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 have been announced, but very little public information is available (possibly being planned or developed).
Phase II studies evaluate pre-use and antiviral safety, usually unplanned, controlled by placebo, and are in multiple sites, while more accurate, effective doses are being considered.
Phase III studies usually involve additional participants, including a control group, and the conduct of a vaccine trial to prevent disease, while monitoring for serious outcomes at the appropriate dose.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 had not been tested on humans (which were in ""preclinical"" studies)".
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the use of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins for therapeutic purposes.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of vaccine development, with a view to starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.

setting and setting a goal.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical trials and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Health Ministry of India announced that it was working on 11 social isolation units, and that even if it were fast it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it had developed coronavirus-like molecules under a small grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
A vaccine candidate is being researched by the laboratory, and human trials are scheduled for July or August 2020.
"Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had given CureVac ""'huge sums of money' to get a Covid-19 vaccine"", and the German government objected".
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA vaccine.
The mRNA vaccine BNT162, is currently undergoing pre-clinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a biotechnology company announced that it would receive results of pre-clinical trials in April 2020 and its final goal could be to start human trials in the autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a joint research project to develop a COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, putting CEPI's total investment in developing a COVID-19 vaccine at US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners who are investors in developing a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing with six different vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they had developed an RNA vaccine for COVID-19 self-diagnosis.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of its availability in China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million to fund 96 research projects on COVID-19 treatments, including several vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as projects being carried out at the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Medicine.
"At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national ""vaccine bank"" of several new vaccines to be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, noting that ""MNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 S1 independently produced strong antibacterial effects in [mice] that were observed 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine""".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine that could be a nasal spray.
Using medicinal viruses, DNA will be made to replicate within the human virus to produce harmless molecules like the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities merged to acquire IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud computing components from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have biological effects, also called implicit effects.
That means it can have more effects than the disease they prevent.
One randomized study in Australia sought to enroll 4,170 health-care workers.
The vaccines developed may not be safe or effective.
The first study to evaluate vaccine efficacy using animal models of COVID-19, such as mouse with ACE2 implanted, other laboratory animals, and human mimics, indicates the need for a level 3 vaccine effort in managing the virus, and international cooperation to ensure safe and universal procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animal models other than humans.
As of 2020, no cure or vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of vaccines and new drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS became epidemic, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments for the MERS-CoV virus.
As of March 2020, there has been one MERS vaccine (DNA) that has completed phase I of clinical trials in humans, and three more are under investigation, and all are viral-vectored, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S) vaccines.
Social media posts promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents cited in various social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
The b'Coronavirus 2019 virus (COVID-19) is an infectious virus caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and diarrhea.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in symptoms of disease, others result in widespread pneumonia and multiple organ death.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 have recovered, and the virus is mainly transmitted by contact, usually through tiny droplets that come out when a person coughs, sneezes, or talks.
Although these droplets are released when you breathe, they usually fall to the ground or on objects rather than become bacteria over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching infected areas and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on objects for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although it can spread before symptoms appear and in later stages of the virus.The most common diagnostic method is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with a swab of the scrotum.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the general public to wear masks vary, with some authorities saying no, others saying no, and others mandating their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Transmission of the virus has been detected in many countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected may not have symptoms of the disease or may have flu-like symptoms such as fever, fever, fatigue, and vomiting.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and green face and lips; prompt medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, wheezing, or sore throat may be seen.
Signs of infection in the mouth-to-hip tract such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been noted in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially caused only chest tightness and a rapid heartbeat.
In others, the disease may progress to pneumonia, paralysis, and death.
This is also called the onset of symptoms.
The onset of symptoms of COVID-19 usually lasts five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all those infected with the virus develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic individuals in transmitting the disease to others is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of people infected without symptoms is currently unknown and is still being investigated, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected have been asymptomatic while hospitalized.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily statistics on 1 April; of the 166 infected on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.
Both the lice and the saliva can contain a virus.
Talking out loud brings out more droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering can lead to bedbugs that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by inhalation and air collectors in the hallways outside people's rooms have taken positive RNA virus samples.
Certain medical procedures such as tubal ligation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the production of particles to be released into the air and result in respiratory transmission.
Although there is concern that it may spread through feces, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; although transmission may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
Although it is not entirely clear how easily a virus spreads, one person typically infects two or three people, says the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Specifically, it was found that the virus survives for one day on cardboard, about three days on plastic (polypropylene) and metal (AISI 304), and about four hours on 99 percent soot.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap can also be effective if used properly; soap products reduce the protective oil membrane of bacteria, kill them, and remove them from the skin and other areas.
Some soaps, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are not effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken two days after the first hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a high virus count, and the sixth patient showed a high virus count on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which first appeared in three people with pneumonia and has been linked to a number of severe respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus originate from coronaviruses.
When outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which explodes its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organs to COVID-19 because the virus enters the stem cells via an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in abundance in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the main cell".
Severe heart damage was found in 12% of hospitalized people with the virus in Wuhan, China, and is more common in serious cases.
High levels of cardiovascular disease symptoms, causing inflammation of the system and immune system disease during the course of the disease, but a severe heart attack may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
The incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus and may be related to a poor prognosis.Identification of COVID-19 deaths showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocytic inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism of ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the detection of inflamed IL-6-secreting monocytes and the causes of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsies.
The WHO has published several protocols for testing the virus.
The most common test is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on breath samples taken with a crab swab; however, a nasal swab or a sputum sample may also be used.
Results are usually seen within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken within two weeks and the results are of little immediate importance.
Chinese scientists have isolated a part of the coronavirus and published the sequence of its genes so that laboratories around the world can develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to identify the virus and disease.
As of 4 April 2020, a genetic test (which can detect active viruses and whether a person has previously been infected with the virus) was developed, but has not been widely used.
Chinese results show that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first clinical trial on 21 March 2020 which was implemented later that month.Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting the virus based on treatment and risk factors for disease control.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities that spread peripherally, asymmetrically and posteriorly are common in bacterial infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (thickening of the lobular septum with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main causes identified in the study are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lungs and pulmonary edema
Four types of complications of the pneumonia virus can be identified:
common pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
treated pneumonia: a combination of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, practicing oral hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not present.
Washing hands thoroughly after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks when in public, in part to reduce the transmission of the virus from people without symptoms of the virus. Social distancing measures are designed to reduce contact between infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large gatherings.
Social distancing guidelines also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, the best way to control COVID-19 is to try to reduce the number of people infected, called ""flattening the line""".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands appear dirty, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing, and sneezing.
It also recommends using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In areas where hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO recommends two methods of producing them locally.
In these methods, the antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol; ""it is not a disinfectant in hand sanitizers""".
Glycerol is added to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygenation, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a normal face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being debated.
Hygiene, living, and eating healthily have been promoted to prevent infection.
Supportive medicine can help those with mild symptoms of newly infected virus.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment options from various agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no cure for COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in medical settings where procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation, are performed.
For physicians caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends confinement in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard measures, preventing contact and smelling of the virus.The CDC defines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Essential items: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air such as dust but protection against an agent of the body is not guaranteed in their use.
If masks are not available, the CDC suggests using face shields or, if no other option is available, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other measures, but some do.
A form of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory distress is still being studied by people in hospitals, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two lead to the same benefit in seriously ill patients is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique reduces the spread of inhaled particles compared to high flow nasal cannula.
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds, reducing the number of people being treated and leading to a failure to cope with the sudden increase in the number of people with severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were in the intensive care unit, 2.3% needed ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in the ICU.
Ventilators are becoming more sophisticated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with pressure-controlled modes and high PEEP are needed to increase oxygenation while reducing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Clinical trials began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the answer.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, several of the investigational drugs are already approved for other uses or have already progressed in trials.
Antibiotics can be tried on people with a more serious infection.
WHO encourages volunteers to participate in research into the efficacy and safety of potential therapeutic agents. The FDA has temporarily approved convalescent plasma as an investigational treatment in cases of serious illness.
It has not been subjected to the medical research needed to prove that it is safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to manage the virus outbreak.
Users are asked to enter a name and ID number.
The app can detect "close encounters" by using tracking data that may indicate a risk of infection.
All users can check the status of three other users.
If a potentially dangerous situation is detected, the app not only encourages social isolation but also alerts health authorities.A large amount of data analysis using mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and invented information are being used to track down infected people and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
This is done to isolate them from the community and to protect those who may have come into contact with infected residents.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared telephone location data with the German government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia developed facial recognition technology to detect violators of social distancing rules.
"Italy's provincial health official Giulio Gallera said he was told by mobile phone operators that ""40 percent of the population continues to move around""".
The German government held a 48-hour computer hack contest over a weekend with 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a national announcement of solutions to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
People may face the stress of isolation, restricted travel, adverse medical effects, or fear of infection itself.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Continued social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, depression and economic collapse are storms that affect people's minds and well-being""".
The virus may have mild effects with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Common cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with a severe or severe infection may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for the COVID-19 viruses based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are scarce.
For those severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing damage to the respiratory tract, septic shock or multiple organ deaths.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were found in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while kidney failure was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the initial case study, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, for a total of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of the lung samples of cadavers showed diffuse alveolar damage and cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung scan showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was noted in elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had preexisting conditions.
The death rates from the virus vary because of such regional differences, but also because of the complexity of the methods used.
The rarity of minor incidents can cause the death rate to be higher than expected.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previous infections may mean that the death rate is now lower.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to receive critical care or die compared to nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung function in some people who have recovered from the flu, and lung masks indicate a possible injury.
This can also lead to post-acute care complications after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous virus could contribute to effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from influenza.
Immunity from the virus appears possible, based on other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive coronavirus test later.
These cases are thought to be a re-infection, not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and to have originated in animals, then to have entered humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the virus outbreak was almost entirely controlled by its transmission from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, indicated that the first date of outbreak of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO literature reported that the first symptoms of the disease appeared on 8 December 2019.
Several methods of counting deaths are widely used.
These numbers vary from region to region and over time and depend on the level of diagnosis, the quality of the medical system, the treatment options, the time from the first outbreak and population factors such as age, gender and health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency virus codes, U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus deaths and U07.2 for COVID-19 virus deaths identified by medical and epidemiological analysis other than laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death-to-viral ratio worldwide is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of identified cases that die from the virus, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (identified and unidentified) people who die from the virus.
These statistics are not time-based and follow the number of individuals from infection to resolution of the incident.
Although not all infected individuals develop disease genes, the presence of disease genes can provide information about how many people are infected.
In the most populous region of Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small community of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the virus was spread by Carnival gatherings, and it entered the youth, causing low death rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially recognized as having the virus.
In addition, the German health-care system is not yet very well-funded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent may have the disease, according to a study by blood export companies.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the death rate vary between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is at age 50, and the gap between men and women closes only at 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for these differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender differences in HIV infection, a lower incidence of smoking among women, and men who develop other medical conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may contribute to the higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected with the virus are men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that epidemics such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at greater risk of exposure to measles.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be ""COVID-19""".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus, D stands for disease, and 19 stands for the year the first outbreak was observed: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid naming a specific geographic area (such as China), species or population group, in accordance with the recommendations of different countries in naming practices aimed at preventing discrimination.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO also uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus that causes COVID-19"" in public discourse".
"Both disease and virus are often referred to as ""coronavirus"""."
"During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, WHO suggested 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as the names to be used for the virus and disease in line with 2015 guidelines against using locations in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of a shortage of materials in manufacturing factories, some digital device manufacturers print medical supplies such as swabs and parts for ventilators.
For example, when a hospital in Italy urgently needed a ventilator valve, and a supplier could not supply it on time, a local company used its own equipment and printed 100 of the needed valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, speculative, false and misleading stories emerged about the origin, spread, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread on the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of infection in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved cure or vaccine for the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government agencies, school groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization launched a ""JOINT Study"" to test the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral drugs that have high potential for efficacy".
No vaccine exists, but various agencies are working to develop vaccines.
Previous SARS-CoV activity is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being studied.
First, researchers plan to develop a vaccine against the virus.
The purpose of using a virus like this, either inactivated or dead, is to establish an immune response against the new COVID-19 virus.
The second, subunit vaccines, aims to create a target that makes the immune system respond to specific aspects of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of target formation).
Vaccines being studied in any of these routes will need to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the pathogen that causes the disease.Gene-based development of the disease has been suggested as a challenge to the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this has not been confirmed.
There are over 300 clinical trials ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven studies examined already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Recycled antiviral drugs account for the bulk of research in China, and nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries will submit a report by the end of April.
A clinical review of the COVID-19 vaccine and potential therapeutics was initiated in April 2020. Several available antiviral drugs are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir mixed with interferon beta.
There was substantial evidence of remdesivir's efficacy, in March 2020.
There have been improvements in the treatment of patients as evidenced by the adequate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was tested in China in February 2020, with unapproved results.
However, it is proposed that the results of the study be evaluated.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that amount is too high and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19.China's 7th schedule guidelines included interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19.
Unapproved data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been suggested in ongoing vivo studies after demonstrating weak inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.The study suggests that an initial increase in protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for SARS-CoV-2 infection through interaction with ACE2 inhibitor.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has major limitations that prevent the medical community from finding these treatments without further research.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has an unknown role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a problem in the later stages of the most severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been added to the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
A randomized phase 2 study was conducted at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to prevent the occurrence of these, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on past research in the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by a different agent, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and potent antibodies produced by the immune systems of COVID-19 recovering patients to people who need them is being investigated as a minimally protective vaccine option.
This technique was tested in SARS and the results are unknown.
Viral neutralization is a commonly used technique where mild gene therapy can create protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms, such as cell-based cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Alternative gene therapies, for example, using homologous genes, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, which contains a fluid component of blood from recovered patients and contains disease-related pathogens, can be increased to be used more quickly.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, later became infected and died of COVID-19 after helping raise awareness about the virus outbreak.
