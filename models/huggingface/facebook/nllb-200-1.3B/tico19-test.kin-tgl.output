The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reports country-by-country COVID-19 statistics from only reliable sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health agencies and WHO, which are updated daily at 8:00.
The data was used to assess the status of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK, and to compare it to Italy.
To reflect the current state of COVID-19 infections, we have collected the 14 day COVID-19 infection data, thus focusing on the COVID-19 transmission trend in each EU/EEA Member State and UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the number of cases reported by each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.

Total in the EU/EEA and UK, the COVID-19 cases started rising around 21 February and then rose sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional note).
This was mainly due to the sharp rise in the number of cases reported in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases (Additional note).
Figure 2 shows the estimated number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and UK and in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March 8:00, the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases equal to or less than Italy's in the previous 3 weeks.
The results indicate that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will soon increase in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the overall COVID-19 infection statistics shows that the epidemic is spreading at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries have different testing standards, health practices are changing, infection definitions may vary from country to country and different protocols exist for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including testing for those who have not yet been tested.



Study 2010/11 showed that emergency rooms and NICs are available in a wide range of formats in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.

The sixth update of the ECDC's COVID-19 rapid assessment, shows examples of patients exceeding capacity, along with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country of COVID-19 hospitalized patients and 90% of those exceeding emergency room beds.

Italyand the situation in other countriessuggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed over 3,000 and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, thus creating a catastrophe for humanity.
Like the other similar virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by microbes and has similar symptoms and symptoms.
COVID-19 is less aggressive and less lethal than SARS, although it is more rapidly transmitted and more common in older adults than in younger people and in men than women.

We focus on basic outcomes such as the disease's identity, cause, virus, how it is diagnosed, how it is treated, how it spreads and how to prevent it.

The virus has many similarities to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease of origin is now called the COVID-19 disease.
The outbreak started in Wuhan, China, and spread to the rest of the country and about 50 other countries worldwide.

WHO warns that COVID-19 is general enemy #1 and that it can have a bigger impact than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 articles have been published on COVID-19 including details on the virus that causes it, its pathogen, its origin, its diagnosis and its treatment since the first report was published on 7 January 2020 describing the viral characteristics that had been detected in various patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research that has been done on this new and highly researched topic.

The current COVID-19 is thus the third confirmed outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Figure Figure 1.1, cases of unknown-cause influenza were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 which was also reported to the National Health Commission of China.
The CoV status document was released seven days later.

The virus is more common in males (0.31/100,000) than in females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread especially in Hubei and surrounding areas.
On average, from COVID-19 detection to detection, it takes about 5 (2-9) days.
It took an average of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) to show symptoms.
The first case was estimated to have died 9.5 (4,8-13) years after the first case.
The baseline susceptibility (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the median R0 was 2.23-4.82.
Case numbers surged before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass travel ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed infection rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main issues with COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe asthma.
CoVs are a subset of large, membrane-bound viruses that contain single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four types, alpha, beta, gamma and delta. In this category, the alpha and beta CoVs are the most infectious viruses.
C-S-blocking glycoprotein binds to ACE2 and DPP4 in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the sequences are correlated.
The viral RNA genome is transcribed into the cell; once the viral genome is transcribed, the genomic RNA along with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms a nucleotide complex that binds to the plasma membrane to form the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 was first identified on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with a 99.98% genetic match in 10 genetic tests taken at the outbreak site, at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 has more similar genes to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.

The first human ACE2 was identified in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to human ACE2 receptor much less strongly than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 infects patients less strongly than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be a new short protein produced by the orf3b protein and a newly discovered protein produced by the orf8 protein.
The protein orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may be involved in the pathogenicity of the virus and in inhibiting IFNβ expression; however, the protein orf8 does not have known morphology or status.

They found that the complex, which has both open and closed structures, binds as a double helix and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which are a marker for the expression and infection of the CoV virus.
B0AT1 is a potential candidate for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs were identified by comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 strain as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like strain CoVs named bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.

Ji and colleagues suggested that snakes may have been the first to infect humans with the virus, which was caused by a mutation in the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, said that mammals, long-mouthed, star-eating mammals that are widely used by Chinese medical professionals, may have been the first to contract SARS-CoV-2 due to the 99% similarity in gene structure found in the mammals' CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

The majority of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive outside for 48 hours in a warm environment and up to 5 days in a sub-20 °C environment with a temperature between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 is shown to be highly resistant to sun exposure and temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing detergents, perastic acid, choroform, and other oil solvents, but not chlorinated, which can effectively kill the virus.
The virus is not known to cause any illness.

T cells include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that play an important role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to create antibodies that can fight the virus, which in turn kills the infected cells.
T-cell helpers produce cytokines that help in inflammation to help protect cells.

Immunity in fluids containing antibodies such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in fighting viral infection.
The virus is transmitted by the human genome.

SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in early cases, is more common in older people with other conditions and in pregnant women.
The virus is most commonly found in people who are highly infected or have a weak immune system.
SARS-CoV-2's average lifespan before symptoms are manifested is between 1 and 14 days, usually between 3 and 7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.

The most recent study, as mentioned above, showed the time taken for symptoms to appear to be 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a total of 8,866 patients.
It is very important for health authorities to set the appropriate quarantine period based on the exact time it takes for symptoms to become more apparent, thus preventing infected but asymptomatic individuals from infecting others.
Traditionally, people who have been exposed to the virus or have been infected are required to quarantine for 14 days.

Therapy is often the first major symptom of COVID-19, which may be either unrelated to other symptoms or accompanied by other symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, multiple colds, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and vomiting.
Some patients have difficulty breathing or low blood oxygen a week after the onset of the disease.

The patient-group study conducted in late December 2019 showed a 98% symptom consistency for fever, 76% for whooping cough, 55% for oxygen problems and 3% for whooping cough; 8% for patients who requested respiratory aids.
Similar conclusions were made in two recent studies of family and asymptomatic cases.

80% of those who requested respirators were more likely to have COVID-19 and the death rate from MERS is higher than from COVID-19.

In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), whooping cough (29%-75%), oxygen problems (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the most severe symptoms with patients requesting respiratory aids reaching about 14%-20%.



The previous study showed that the baseline infection rate (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 was high at 6.47, the 95% infection rate (CI) was 5,71-7,23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
SARS-CoV-2 vs MERS-CoV vs SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 are found in Table Table 1.1.
The virus is also known as SARS-CoV-2 and is also known as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
The virus is also known as SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore more potent against SARS-CoV-2 than against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

For example, Drops from Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been shown to be potentially useful in treating COVID-19.
TCM was used in 87% of local patients, such as Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), and in Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with a very low recovery rate (13%).


They found that the time needed to regain normal body temperature, develop symptoms and be admitted to hospital was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Significantly, the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).

It is also advisable to demonstrate the efficacy of these medicines and to explain the benefits of TCM alone or in combination with other medicines if possible.

This may be because 17 years after SARS broke out and no one else has ever been infected.

The MERS vaccine has been developed using deactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, hyperparticles, viral-like particles and proteins that are self-replicating and some of these vaccines have been tested in animals.

The virus is also known as the coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun to reveal its potential in thousands of cases.

Age: Age is a critical factor in the diagnosis of SARS and is also relevant for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was most prevalent in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% being over 50 years in the 8,866 patient study as described above.
Patients who requested urgent care were more likely to have other conditions and conditions and were significantly older than those who did not request it (average age 66 to 51 years), meaning age is a factor in the prevalence of COVID-19 infections.
Gender: Men were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
Constipation: COVID-19 patients requiring urgent care often have severe and inflammatory heart failure.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.Constipation is a complication of a heart attack.
Psychiatric cardiac arrestwas also a major cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 was also shown to be able to attack ACE2 mutated antiretroviral strains, causing dark circles in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that the age of the person with the disease is strongly correlated and can affect the outcome.
Laboratory findings: The level of red blood cell proteins (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of tumor or tissue lesions and has been shown to be one of the potential factors in the treatment of disease, drug reception and recovery.
The relationship between CRP and ageing and COVID-19 immunity has also been demonstrated.

These lesions are highly expressed in various tissues, especially in the heart and in the dark, and are released when the body's organs are damaged.

Use of anti-inflammatory drugs: As mentioned above, anti-inflammatory drugs are immunosuppressive drugs that are commonly used as adjuvant medicines in the treatment of infectious diseases in order to reduce the irritation of the immune system.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Therefore, when needed, COVID-19 patients should take low doses of anti-inflammatory medication and for a short period of time.
Depression:As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients experienced extreme stress due to prolonged isolation and severe depression and the loss of close relatives of those who had been infected.

According to the patient studies done so far, COVID-19 appears to have different characteristics from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 is also known to cause respiratory infections in the respiratory tract, and to cause mild or no symptoms in the early days of infection, as with other commonly occurring influenza-causing CoVs.

The virus is transmitted by the SARS-CoV virus, which is transmitted by the SARS-CoV virus.
The COVID-19 pandemic is therefore more severe and more difficult to control than SARS.

The most interesting estimate is that the pandemic will end in March, and the recovery period will be between 3 and 4 months.

Paul Hunter and colleagues found that COVID-19, which appears to be more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A Canadian team announced that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in chest and throat samples of recovered patients 2 weeks after discharge, suggesting that the new virus may be returning as a normal flu.



️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
COVID-19 and SARS and MERS are compared in the following (Figure (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted by touching the infected object.
The virus has also been detected in the urine, suggesting that there may be a new mode of transmission of oral contact.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of patients were likely to have contracted hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with a history of other infections and 40 physicians.

The first precaution that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of medical masks and N95 masks (class # 1860s) helps to prevent the spread of the virus.
Medical masks help to prevent contaminated body fluids from being passed through the air or through contact with objects.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As there are areas that can pass through five medical masks in parallel, doctors who frequently see patients should wear N95 masks (class # 1860s) instead of medical masks.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Doctors must also wear face shields or refractive lenses when caring for patients.
For people in general who live in areas that are affected or susceptible to the virus, it is absolutely essential that everyone wash their hands frequently with disinfectant, try to isolate themselves and stay home and avoid contact with people who may be infected.

The message has significantly eased public awareness, especially as the country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and the chances of preventing the outbreak in Wuhan are soaring.
China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can learn from this big lesson and make big changes in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more discerning in issuing public notices as the public is taking every word into account and then changing their behaviour and decisions; (2) more attentive to the unique information provided by hospitals and making appropriate decisions rather than waiting for reports from doctors or officials in a formal manner; (3) more action to prevent the entire epidemic from starting rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more frequent organisation of specialised workshops to help the public become more aware of the epidemic and try and improve the response to it in various situations.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus started in late December 2019.

COVID-19 is more prevalent in older adults than in younger adults and affects men more than women, and the age and mortality rates are also higher in older adults than in younger adults.
SARS is more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when they have no symptoms and SARS patients are more likely to spread the virus when they are sick, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA test may not be detectable in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be re-infected.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.

How does the virus evolve as it spreads from person to person?
Will it be a global pandemic, a SARS pandemic, or a flu pandemic?

The outbreak of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East influenza (MERS) have changed the paradigm of how HCoVs can be devastating and life threatening.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in mid-late 2019 has made CoVs a media sensation again and has surprised us with its highly infectious but less pathogenic nature compared to its SARS-CoV counterpart.
The HCoV is a zoonotic disease and therefore identifying the zoological origin of HCoVs can be helpful.
The HCoVs are mostly derived from bacteria that are not pathogenic to humans.
The virus is also known to be a virus of the human genome.

The study of animal interactions with CoVs may also be useful in determining how CoVs infect humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is important that we compare different HCoVs focusing on how the virus mutates and how the genome is expressed.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is being studied in this area.

Coronaviridae is a group of viruses that are highly pathogenic and highly receptive to RNA.
CoVs, also known as CoVs, are large, 26-32 kilobytes in size RNA viruses that are crown-like in electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unbroken genomes that are structurally identical.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large, closely related proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b), which form the pp1a and pp1ab proteins of varying function.
The proteins with opposite motifs are then modified to form 16 homologous proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs of uniformly arranged proteins, including the head (S), tail (E), tail (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The virus is a member of the family of viruses known as the viruses family.

The HCoVs are a family of viruses that are transmitted by the human genome.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the deadliest outbreaks in recent history, affecting 8,000 people and killing about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East influenza (MERS) epidemic has spread to the Arabian Peninsula and occasionally to other parts of the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the cause of the current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) which as of 2 March 2020 has killed 3,120 people and infected over 91,000.

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The virus is also known to be a cause of infection.
The coronavirus is a virus that causes the death of millions of people.
The HCoVs are also known to be highly pathogenic.
SARS-CoV-2 is a common strain of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four locally isolated HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 on the other hand, exhibits the most common symptoms during infection with HCoVs that are localized, such as having a specific, mild or no symptoms.

The HCoVs are also known to be highly pathogenic to humans.
The virus is also known as SARS-CoV-2 and is a member of the SARS-CoV family.
The virus is also known as SARS-CoV-2 and is also known as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in viral tests.
The study should determine whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and oral fluid is as significant as SARS-CoV in at least some areas.
It is also important to consider in particular whether SARS-CoV-2 is as susceptible to a variety of conditions as is the case for HCoVs that are susceptible to a variety of conditions depending on their location.
SARS-CoV-2 is also known to be a virus, and is also known to be a virus of the human genome.
The HCoVs are a subtype of the HCoVs, and all four have mild adaptations to humans.

SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the HCoV virus four in outpatient transmission.
The virus is highly contagious, at least for now.
The virus is also known as the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt well to humans and move among humans without leaving a predator.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The HCoVs are most likely to be transmitted from animals where they are closely related to a common ancestor at the molecular level.
The virus is normally adapted to the animal and does not cause disease in the animal.
The HCoVs are also known to be highly pathogenic and highly toxic to humans.
The HCoVs are the most commonly encountered viruses in the world.

The predator is a potential human vector and a highly susceptible animal that can rapidly multiply the virus and transmit it to humans by increasing the rate of human infection.
The HCoV may be non-infectious if it has not been able to mutate in its host.
The HCoVs, on the other hand, can adapt to and remain in the host for a long time.
In this case, the animal grows into a naturally polymorphic animal.
Sars was first identified in the wild in the wild hunting.
Subsequent blood tests showed that commercial animals had a higher immune response to SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The first SARS-CoV-like viruses were identified in chickens and dogs in the pet trade.

The human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 is taken from the testes of the human genome using ACE2 to enter the body.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Although the two viruses are closely related, it is generally thought that WIV1 is not the causative agent of SARS-CoV and that the bacteria are not the primary hosts of SARS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV virus is classified as a subtype of the CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 viruses in bats.
The virus is also known as the MERS-CoV.
RNA polymerase protein in MERS-CoV is very similar to its beta-CoV pathogen found in Europe and Africa.
The MERS-CoV virus is not present in wild turkeys.

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, which are known to be viruses that infect humans.
In contrast, where alpha-CoVs are the HCoV-229E gene group, macaques and camels may have evolved the virus and transmitted it to humans, similarly to MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is a good example of virus transmission between species from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolution of the MERS-CoV strain in bats was known when it was first identified and has been confirmed by subsequent studies.

Longevity, homogeneity, close proximity and strong flight are the factors that make the octopus a great 'virus transmitter'.
The MERS-CoV virus was first isolated in camels several years ago.
He has adapted these camels from being a predator to a safe and natural host for viruses.
The MERS-CoV virus is a mild pathogen and evolves slowly in these animals.
The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and humans are not susceptible to MERS-CoV as its transmission is slow.

Secondly, the large RNA genome in CoVs uses alternate transcription in the transgenome and modifies the base; thus, increasing the chance of mutation in the host, which is beneficial in the development of new CoVs when appropriate.
This is supported by the structure of the protein-producing RNA and its function in the 3rd phase of the genome.
Third, CoVs also often mutate into other RNAs via genome modification.
The virus is a virus that causes the death of the virus.
RNAs that are very similar and have additional genomes can change the base to produce new CoVs.
The virus is also known to be a pathogen, and is also known to be a pathogen.

The RBD of the S-protein of the CoV virus is generally associated with the receptor and is selected for its resistance to the intron antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is at the 318th to 510th position of the S1 amino acids, making it bind to human ACE2 and the primary entry point for the virus.
SARS-CoV RBDs can detect ACE2 receptor viruses in a variety of animals, including chickenpox, chickpeas, mice, and chickpeas, which allows the animals to transmit the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase binding to the S protein and the ACE2 human receptor.

It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 is receptor-like for the same receptor as SARS-CoV.
30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein suggests that the association of the S protein to ACE2 in humans may have been altered.
In fact, cryo-EM studies indicate a 10 - 20 factor strong association of human ACE2 with the S protein of SARS-CoV.

Secondly, if parasites transmit the virus directly to humans, then the way humans interact with parasites should be documented.
Third, if a third mammal behaves like a true predator, how it interacts with different species of animals such as humans, reptiles and mammals should be understood.

In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Since its release, it has attracted a lot of attention.

For example, the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, published seven volumes including some significantly revised chapters.
Our guideline then adopted the idea of Zhou and others, who developed a simple system for scoring based on clinical experience.

We support and thank them for their hard work.

As stated in the seventh publication (3 March 2020) confirmation of suspected cases must match one of the following two diagnostic criteria for a complete diagnosis, or must meet three criteria if the epidemiological history is unclear:
History of outbreak: (1) Traveling to or living in Wuhan and its vicinity, or elsewhere with COVID-19 infection within the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) Contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with nucleic acid test); (3) Contact with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its vicinity, or elsewhere with COVID-19 infection within the last 14 days before symptoms began; (4) Contact with prevalent infections within a specific area (more than 2 fever or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks, such as at home, at school, in the office, etc.).
Symptoms of disease: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) with symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, no increase or decrease in baseline.

On Monday, ALDI also announced that one pack should not be exceeded.

It was alleged that consumers were buying these toilet paper in bulk due to COVID-19 fears when it was necessary to quarantine.
Woolworths also reduced the number of toilet paper items in household packaging to one pack per order on Wednesday.
The subsequent changes will require no more than one pack of four toilet paper to be installed by Woolworths and Coles stores on 4 and 5 March.

Canberra's Costco also reduced the number to two packets of toilet paper last week.
To further reduce the shortage of toilet paper, Coles ordered larger packages from retailers and increased the frequency of ordering, and Woolworths ordered more toilet paper, while ALDI stockpiled the merchandise for the Wednesday promotion which was sold out early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, said that retailers could increase supply, but the regulations for delivery trucks set by the local council made it difficult.



He also claimed that clean paper is a packaged commodity, which makes it scarce in stores, and that when it is sold out, it leaves a lot of space on shelves, which makes it more likely that the product is gone.
Coles and Woolworths thinks that having more products on the shelves liketoilet paper and pesticides available in bulk would reduce the fear of people.

WHO yatangaza COVID-19 kuwapigwa
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the current COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to be a pandemic.

"Total countries can change the direction of the pandemic.
Countries are identifying, testing, treating, quarantining, isolating, and promoting prevention", says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
"We are deeply concerned about the rapid spread and spread of the pandemic and the lack of action being taken to control it.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director General of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this epidemic "has never happened".
Apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has exceeded its exposure and grown into a global pandemic, he said in a statement released by CNN in February.
We never saw an outbreak caused by coronavirus
Actually, we haven't seen an epidemic that can be effectively fought", he continues.
The pandemic follows the WHO's January decision to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of global concern.
It is clear that the pandemic is making things worse, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director General of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
Associated Press reported on Thursday that at least 126,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide, with over 4,600 people having died.
2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the current outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the highly pathogenic influenza virus (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, an outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China; on 30 January 2020, it was declared a public health emergency of global concern, and on 11 March 2020, it was declared an epidemic.

About 364,000 people were cured.
The death rate is 4% in China, while globally it is between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.8% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the pandemic is "a major public health problem" and that "there is no cure for the disease".
The pandemic has disrupted economic and social activities, postponing or halting sports, religious, political and cultural activities and creating a global supply shortage caused by mass consumerism due to the fear of pandemic.
Schools and universities closed at both national and regional levels in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's students.Schools and universities closed at both national and regional levels in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's students.
The virus has also spread online, with reports of violence or discrimination against foreigners, especially Chinese, East and Southeast Asians, and others from the virus-dominated areas.

The virus that caused the pandemic known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus similar to the coronavirus in bats, rodents and SARS-CoV. The first known case of the virus was reported on December 1, 2019, and the patient had no contact with the zoo.
The first cases were reported in December 2019, with two-thirds of them having contact with the source.
On 3 March 2020, unconfirmed reports by the South China Morning Post reported that the case was identified on 17 November 2019, with a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, possibly the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections were down in China but increasing sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new infections outside China exceeding new infections in China for the first time.
It is possible that there may be many unreported cases; in particular, those with mild symptoms.

The number of cases is the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and the results have been confirmed according to government protocols.


The statistics released on 30 March showed that the number of cases in Italy was higher than the reported.
The number of new infections (R0) of COVID-19 would range from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure could be 5.7.
The majority of COVID-19 patients are recovering.
For non-infectious patients, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, but the most common is 14 days.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher than reported, as it does not include untested deaths, e.g. deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.

We know that the reported death toll is not consistent with the actual death toll, and this is consistent with reports that the United States is not responding to the pandemic. This response is often during pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed case of the pandemic was reported on January 9, 2020.



The figures vary by region and time, and are based on measurements, medical practices, treatment, post-epidemic time and demographic factors such as age, gender and overall health. The average death rate among infections is the number of deaths minus the number of infections over a period of time.

The statistics are not randomized and track specific individuals from infection to recovery or death.

The Oxford University Centre for Symptomatic Medicine estimates the overall prevalence of the disease to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above figures are in line with the results of the first COVID-19 test of vaccinated people in Germany and the study figures showing the mortality rate based on the test results.
WHO says the pandemic is preventable.

Without control, pathogens often persist and begin to decline when disease is lacking in contagious populations, says Maciej Boni of Penn State University.

"The pandemic may be over by June" when all countries comply with WHO guidelines to curb the spread of the pandemic, said Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government's chief medical adviser.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2  will be migratory, possibly for one or two years.

I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, because it is so contagious, will be completely eradicated andit could become a seasonal disease, and then recur every year, said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The return of this highly contagious virus will be driven by the human body's immune system and the mutation of the virus.
COVID-19 symptoms may be unique and infected individuals may not show symptoms.
The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and coughing (68%).

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies symptoms including difficulty breathing, chest pain, sudden dizziness, difficulty waking, sore eyes or lips, and advises patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms do not resolve. If the condition progresses, it can lead to dizziness, severe respiratory problems, bleeding, internal bleeding, and death.

China reports a low asymptomatic rate of up to 44%.
The average time to symptoms (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; usually a few days. A dubious example is the number of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell from 30% to 15%.
Some of the information on how the disease is transmitted is not well understood.
It is thought that most infections are spread by close contact with the fluids that come from coughing, sneezing or being within 1 to 2 meters of another person.
Studies have shown that coughing without a mask can cause the fluid to move from 4.5 to 8.2 meters [4.5 to 8.2 ft].
Others suggest that the virus may be transmitted by long-term respiratory fluids, which may be released when a person speaks. Respiratory fluids can also be released when a person breathes out when speaking, whereas the virus is transmitted primarily through the air.
The fluid may fall into the mouth or nose of people who are in close proximity or inhaled into the lungs.
Some procedures such as pulmonary resuscitation and CPR can cause the respiratory fluid to enter the air and the disease to spread through the air.
It can also spread by touching the infected area such as the skin and touching the face, nose or mouth.

China has denied that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from infected saliva and via the infected mouth.The virus is most transmissible within the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can spread before symptoms appear and during severe illness.


The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily a disease can be transmitted, with one infected person infecting two or three others. The virus can persist for hours or days in a particular location.
Certainly, the virus can last for up to three days on plastic material (porporopyrene) and 304 days on stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four days on copper metal.

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the SARS-CoV virus. It is not present in humans, but is killed by household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the SARS-CoV virus.
Supposedly, it is from animals.
The coronavirus is classified as a Betacoronavirus, a member of the family of Sarcocoronavirus (family B) and both originated from bats.
96% of the genome is similar to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) tests.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in genome structure between the virus from the mammals and the virus from the humans.

As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology states:CT should not be used for screening or as a primary method of testing for COVID-19.
WHO has published a number of protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses the real-time rRT-PCR laboratory method.
The test can be performed on samples taken from the respiratory tract or blood.

The test is usually performed using a nasal scanner although a nasal scanner can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing methods to collect blood samples that also detect antibodies.

In the United States, the Cellex blood test is approved as a medical treatment but is only used by licensed laboratories.
T-screen is used to test people who show symptoms of either GGO or fluid in the lungs.
The Italian Society of Radiation Therapy is developing an international database of radiation test results from confirmed cases.

Taping masker
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
Stephen Griffin, virologist at the University of Leeds, says,Wearing a mask reduces the tendency of people to touch their face, which is the most common source of infection when hands are not cleaned properly. Masks are also used by caregivers who may be infected.
WHO initializes wearing masks only when they are at high risk of infection, such as in the care of someone with COVID-19, and believes that wearing masks prevents people from touching their faces.

Belgium withdrew 100,000 useless masks suspected to be from China, but actually from Colombia.

The World Health Organization praised the efforts of Chinese authorities in controlling and preventing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization said there was a difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy and thus hampered the prevention and containment efforts, and the current outbreak where the government "has been providing constant information to ensure that people do not panic ahead of the New Year holidays".

The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, said that PHEIC is a risk factor for global spread, particularly in poor and middle-income countries without strong health systems.


Tedros also announced that "we all share the same strength as we share the same weakness" and urged nations to "invest now or pay more later". On February 11, in a press conference, WHO confirmed COVID-19 as the name of the disease.

On February 25, WHO announced that "the world should do more to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic", although it was still early in the process of identifying the virus as a pandemic, "starting the pandemic".

Mike Ryan, WHO's Deputy Director for Emergency Programs, warned: "This is a real signal to every country in the world: Wake up.
The virus is coming and you need to be prepared", he emphasizes that firm measures to deal with it can help avoid "the dangers it poses".
Ryan went on to say that the information available has never led public health authorities to declare it a global pandemic, saying that declaring it would mean that "we actually believe that everyone on the planet will be exposed to the virus".

The Director-General said that WHO is "deeply concerned about the rapid spread and the lack of action". WHO has been severely criticized for the apparent lack of effective measures to contain the outbreak, including the declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.



The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be a reason to discriminate against a particular group.
The experts emphasized that everyone has a right to health, including people with disabilities, people from underserved groups, the elderly, homeless, homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people in detention, as well as refugees and other special groups in need of government assistance.

The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which occurs during the last week of Lent, has been suspended.
Many dioceses have required older Christians to stay home rather than attend church on Sundays; some congregations have broadcast meetings over the radio, Internet, or television while others have arranged for meetings to be streamed from their cars.
While the Catholic Church closed its dioceses and chapels and the large St. Peter's Square to pilgrims, other churches have also suspended meetings and reduced the number of gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, and the like.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the suspension of Friday prayers in affected areas and the closure of shrines later, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and local residents from access to shrines in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the global sports calendar since the end of World War II.
20 UEFA Champions League 201920, 2020 European Championship, 2019 US Handball Championship, and 2019 NHL.
The pandemic also delayed the 2020 Summer Olympics which were scheduled to begin in late July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee announced that the Games would be "postponed to no later than 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021". Gambling venues and other gaming venues around the world were closed and card games such as poker were postponed and cancelled.
This has led to a shift in online gambling, with many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in subscribers. Entertainment has also been affected, with many bands cancelling or postponing their concert tours.
Theatres such as Broadway have closed all the shows.
Some artists have sought to maintain their online production and sharing as an alternative to traditional live performances, online concerts, or online "parties" where artists are invited to take part, and thus to promote and promote their work.

Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with nasal samples is the only reliable method only in the first week of infection.
The virus can then be eliminated in the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For those tested positive within the second week, it is recommended that they undergo further testing such as a test of the testes.
One of the latest PCR tests was tested at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using rapid reaction-to-reaction (rRT-PCR) with 250,000 kits donated by the World Health Organization.

In March 2020, research papers concluded that "at first the chest x-ray is not very useful for screening, and the results of computed tomography (CT) may be present even before the symptoms start".
The characteristics of CT scanning include the ability to view all sides of the lungs, providing precise views of the lateral, medial and posterior parts.
The spread of the lower lung, the acute congestion of some parts of the lungs, increases with the progression of the epidemic.

As of March 2020, the US National Academy of Radiation Medicine has ordered that "The Wuhan test is no longer used for testing for CoronavirusCOVID-19". As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that PCR be used for testing first.

This could help in detecting infection in humans as early as day 7 or after the initial symptoms, in assessing immunity and in conducting surveillance in the population. Analysis of samples can be done in a conventional laboratory (CLT) or other dedicated testing facility (PoCT).
The mass spectrometry in many medical laboratories will be used for analysis, but the availability of results will depend on the speed of the process.
In conventional laboratories, a single sample of collected blood is usually used, although successive samples may be used to monitor immunity.
In other cases, a single sample of normal blood is obtained with a perforation.
Unlike PCR, a pre-exposure assay is not required before testing.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for use with emergency authorization.
The ability to detect infection can reach hundreds of tests in hours which is much faster than the standard PCR test for viral RNA.

Hong Kong has introduced a system whereby anyone suspected of infection can stay home, with the emergency department providing a "targeted kit", removing and returning the test results later.The UK National Health Service (NHS) has announced plans to introduce home testing for suspected infections, which will eliminate the risk of the patient spreading the virus to others while in hospital, or requiring the patient to be vaccinated in the car.In taking the COVID-19 test, the doctor will professionally adhere to all instructions.

The cost is covered by the health insurance if the exam is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total testing capacity of 160,000 people per week.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a new study on the effects of the coronavirus on the health of the population.
The World Health Organization has approved a German design for a kit to be sent to poor countries that cannot afford to buy their own.
On 17 January 2020, the Germans announced their system, the system developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was no longer available until 28 January, causing delays in testing in the US. China and the US had concerns about the quality of the available testing equipment, and these countries along with Australia were unable to satisfy the market for the equipment they had and to comply with the advice given by medical experts.


On March 16, the World Health Organization called on countries to increase the number of tests and related programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for diagnostic devices due to the spread of the virus, which has led to a significant shortage of laboratories in the United States, has created a serious problem in the supply of equipment and medicines needed to treat the pandemic.
In March 2020 China announced that there were concerns regarding the quality of its testing equipment.

The Institute explained that incorrect results can be due to improper sampling or improper use of equipment.
The Spanish Ministry said that they will remove the false-results kits from the market and replace them with Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the Czech products purchased from China gave false-results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million items from China that were found to be of poor quality.
Prime Minister Matovič wanted to dump them in the Danube. Turkish Health Minister Ateş Kara said that the test kits purchased from China are of poor quality and should not be used. UK purchased from China, 3.5 million test kits but recently in April 2020 announced that they are not usable.

Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holidays on 23 March.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS is rising.
The statistics show that countries with more tests in relation to the death rate have lower death rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to identify those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO is recommending that countries that do not have the testing capability and laboratory capacity to test COVID-19 send their samples of the first five positive cases and the first ten positive cases of COVID-19 to 16 WHO model laboratories for validation.
Of the 16 model laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Infected as % of tested" may change depending on the national testing policy.

It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The process of disinfection is enhanced by adding soap or cleaning products to the water.
The main benefit of soaps and cleansers is to reduce anti-wrinkle and increase the effectiveness of the cleaning.
Water alone does not cleanse the skin properly because oils and fats, like those in soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
To clean, means to use enough water.

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not reduce microbial content on hands.
Oxygenated hand sanitizer or anti-infection hand sanitizer is a waterless hand sanitizer.

The majority is made from isopropyl or ethanol alcohols, which are either carbomer-based in oils or added to solvents such as keratin to make them more perfumable or foamy in order to ease the process and reduce the alcohol's adverse effects.
The addition of free hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial resistance. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are more effective at killing bacteria.
Alcohol-containing hand sanitizers kill viruses, multiple drug resistant viruses (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, mumps, flu, and hepatitis) and also the hepatitis virus.Alcohol-containing hand sanitizers kill viruses, multiple drug resistant viruses (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, mumps, influenza, and hepatitis) and also the hepatitis virus.

The continued use of this method is based on ease of use and quick killing of pathogens; however, this method should not replace the standard hand washing method unless soap and water are available.
The use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless the product is softened or softened.
The dryness of the skin caused by alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by glycogen or other skin softeners.
In medical studies, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are more resistant to skin irritation than soaps or disinfectants.
Rare are the rashes, rashes, or allergies caused by alcohol in hand sanitizer.
The lower risk of skin damage makes this method more popular than hand washing with soap and water.

The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is largely dependent on the ingredients, and was previously less effective than alcohol and other alcohol-based detergents.
Recently, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have a persistent post-use antimicrobial effect, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to produce a gradual decrease in yield after repeated use, possibly due to its gradual impact on the skin.

The use of ashes or soil is a more efficient alternative to water, but it is also less efficient than using soap.
One concern is that soil or soil is made up of microorganisms that can contaminate and thus increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, dust kills germs because it forms acid when it comes in contact with water.
WHO recommends using sand or dust when soap is not available.
The appropriate handwashing practices recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Throughflow water should be used as the water in the bottle can be contaminated, and the water temperature does not change much.
Wash your hands thoroughly with plenty of soap, and wash the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your palms.
Soap cleans the skin of germs, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more safely with soap than with water alone.
️Secure your hands for at least 20 seconds.

Alternative methods can be used to facilitate hand washing where the use of soap or rubber is not available, such as spraying with a hanging jar (sandbox) or a metal with a pre-drilled hole or using ash when necessary in developing countries. When there is a water shortage (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are alternative methods such as hand washing and other inexpensive methods.

Promotion and promotion of hand washing with soap can make a difference in action, raise awareness of hand washing and lead to long-term societal change.
To do this effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
An assessment of 70 studies found community-based approaches to be effective in increasing handwashing practices in LMICs, whereas social media advertising is not.One example is the promotion of handwashing practices in schools as a "Three-Star Approach" by UNICEF by encouraging schools to use simple, affordable methods to promote handwashing by students using soap, and other hygienic materials.

The importance of handwashing in human health; in particular, for vulnerable people such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of handwashing: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of the modern nursing profession".

The 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to a greater understanding of the importance of hand washing with soap in preventing the transmission of these infectious diseases.
For example, large signs with "best way to wash hands" are hung next to hand washing trays in public toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.

The phrase "Pontius Pilate washed his hands" comes from the biblical Book of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but the phrase remains in common use in English-speaking countries.

It has been found that people, after remembering or thinking about doing inappropriate actions, try to wash their hands more often and value hand washing equipment more.

According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a low risk occupation is a workplace where employees are in close contact with other employees, where basic infection prevention measures are mandated, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home when sick, respiratory health prevention guidelines and regular hygiene and disinfection of the workplace.

OSHA recommends that healthcare and recreation workers who have been in contact with a person with or suspected of having COVID-19 are at increased risk of infection, which increases the risk when these personnel perform respiratory procedures, take or test samples of a person with or suspected of having COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic can have a huge impact on the workplace.

Trade patterns can change, whether in terms of how goods are delivered and how to buy those goods (such as buying goods at cheaper hours or servicing or delivery by car).
Finally, the shipment of goods from areas affected by the COVID-19 outbreak can be curtailed. Prevention and response planning can be used as a preventive measure.

Treatment with targeted devices is to protect workers from work-related risks regardless of employee behaviour and may be more effective in implementing these.
Management measuresare changes to work rules or procedures that require implementation by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than the previous two approaches, but can help prevent contamination.
All PPE types should be selected based on the risks the worker has, appropriate to the job (e.g. respirators), regularly and properly worn, regularly checked, handled properly and replaced as needed and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the US OSHA, low risk work is a work that is highly stressful for the general public or for coworkers.

CDC of the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, fever symptoms and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretic or other symptomatic medications and simplify procedures for requesting sick leave, allowing employees to stay home with a sick family member and informing employees of these measures.
OSHA defines a low-risk occupation as one that involves frequent contact or close contact within 1.8 m with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through interpersonal transmission in a business setting or through recent travel to a COVID-19 infection site.

OSHA recommends that some health and recreation workers are at high or very high levels of risk of infection.


Oxygenation includes injection, coagulation, respiratory injection, some dental procedures and examination or internal testing.
The greater risk of infection in the restroom is associated with the organism preparation staff of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; they are at higher risk when performing lethal screening tests. And the control of infection using specialized equipment includes risk groups including quarantine rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including ventilation.
A special ventilator may be appropriate for some of the nursing and recreational staff.

WHO initializes hospitalization in isolation in case of suspected COVID-19 infection. And with the exception of protective clothing, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for those who work within 2 meters of those who are known or suspected to be sick, infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who are in the process of ventilating patients.
In the US, NIOSH-approved N95 or higher respirators must be used in accordance with a strict, written respirator safety protocol including appropriate wear assessment, wear training and clinical testing.
Other types of respirators can protect the wearer better and make the worker feel more comfortable.WHO does not recommend that workers wear masks because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a disease transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only medical masks for hospitality workers. WHO recommends only medical masks for hospitality workers.
WHO recommends respiratory technicians, caregivers, or those who carry COVID-19 patients without supplemental ventilation, to wear a medical mask, a mask, a jacket, and gloves.

It's not mentioned, but we're going to emphasize it.
You don't have to ask for sick leave or paid leave, you should inform your manager and he will help your team to revise the schedule and schedule so that the basic work can continue.

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein that forms enzymes that bind to the outer membrane (cell wall) of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 modulates the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount ofangiotensin-II and increasing Ang (((1-7) making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a gateway to the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-con 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme that is localized to the endothelial surface and other tissues.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal portion of peptidase M2 and the C-terminal portion of collectrin, which is a renal metabolite.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I protein complex, whose active enzyme subunit is localized to the surface of lung cells and other cells.
ACE2 is released from the cell membrane through a sheddase enzyme, and the resulting protein enters the gastrointestinal tract and then out of the intestine.
ACE2 is found in many tissues: ACE2 binds to cell walls, primarily type II lung tissues, small intestine cells, blood vessel cells and blood cells, and to small nerve cells in many tissues.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The first task of ACE2 is to set the correct ACE.
ACE is a transcription of angiotensin I where angiotensin II is a transcription of the blood pressure.
ACE2 also synthesizes carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine in angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses in angiotensin with large blood vessels (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 is also a potent transporter of the SLC6A19 active amino acid and is involved in Hartnup syndrome.
As a transcriptional protein, ACE2 acts as a key entry point for the cell cycle that cuts through certain coronaviruses, namely HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).

The protein is also involved in the regulation of TMPRSS2 and is being studied as a potential treatment. This led to the hypothesis that reducing ACE2 levels in the cell could help fight the disease.

A comprehensive review and analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% lower risk of influenza infection compared to control subjects".
"The risk of measles infection was reduced in high-risk patients treated with ACE inhibitors, particularly in patients with heart disease, and in those with heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease in deaths from measles, although the outcome is not significantly greater than the risk of overall measles infection.
ACE2 (rhACE2) is being promoted as the newest treatment for pulmonary hypertension, and appears to improve pulmonary circulation and increase oxygen supply to areas affected by pulmonary bacterial secretion.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and its onset is 30 minutes later than the time when the effects of the reaction begin to be seen (when) in 24 hours.
The use of rhACE2 has been studied in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
COVID-19 is a mobile application designed to help identify people who have been in contact with someone in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example in the process of identifying people ("numbers") who may have been in contact with an infected person.


Caution about breaches of personal data has been raised, particularly in relation to systems based on location detection for app users.
Another highly invasive alternative is using Bluetooth to log in and identify other mobile phones using a neighboring app.

Australia and New Zealand are considering mobile apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether and Russia's BlueTrace. Russia is planning to launch a virtual lockdown app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, which will ensure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security management at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of practical problems that mobile app systems cause, including the fact that they signal that someone is sick and alive and that they do not actually do what they are designed to do if the use of these apps is limited to a small number of people.

When these fluids are released during inhalation, they usually fall onto the ground or onto an object rather than infecting a person at a distance.

The virus can survive outside for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can also be contagious before symptoms appear and before infection has spread.The most reliable method of detection is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) performed using nasal samples.
It is important that a person who is suspected of being infected and his caregivers wear masks.


Infection amongst the same population has been detected in all six WHO regions.

It is uncommon to experience respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, sneezing or sore throat.
Symptoms of vaginal discharge such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are commonly seen on the upper arm.
The Chinese patients first reported symptoms of chest tightness and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may become so severe that the person becomes short of breath, many organs stop working, and even die.
This is called the manifestation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 6 days but can range from 2 to 14 days.
97.5%

The number of people who do not have symptoms is still unknown but is being studied, based on data from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that says 20% of all infected people are discharged without symptoms.
China's National Health Commission on April 1 began to include these cases in its daily case count; of 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Thousers can carry large amounts of virus.
Talk a lot makes more fluids than talk a lot.


Therapies such as catheterization and respiratory augmentation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions which can lead to infection.

The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although the ease of transmission of the virus is not yet known, it can be transmitted by one person to two to three people. The virus can survive outdoors for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus lasted one day on board, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and solid metal ((AISI 304), and four hours on 99% malleable metal.
This can however change due to cold and even heat.
Savon and insecticides, when used properly, can kill the virus;soap damages the anti-virus protein, inhibiting its activity and even removing it from the body or tissue where the virus is present.
Other uses include benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a pesticide), but it is not very effective. In a Hong Kong study, a sample of saliva was taken for two days after admission to hospital.
Five of the six patients, the first test showed high viral levels, and the sixth showed high viral levels in the second day's tests.

A test of blood may be performed, but requires two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals and results are of little immediate value.
China has been able to isolate the coronavirus cells and release the lab results to the world so that it can freely produce PCR cells that can be used to test the virus infection.


The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved testing facilities on 21 March 2020 which should be operational by the end of the month. The testing guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined a method for testing infection based on clinical evidence and the impact of the pandemic.
Infection is usually initiated by the secretion of viral cells, which accumulate, separate from the host and then spread to the rest of the body.
As the virus progresses, it penetrates the respiratory tract, creating a pathway (clogging the respiratory tract by blocking the airways) and binding together.

One study in China showed that 5% were taken to the emergency room, 2.3% needed oxygenation and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of COVID-19 patients are hospitalized with ICU care.
The use of ventilators continues to be a challenge due to the increasingly challenging air pollution issues caused by COVID-19.
The need for more PEEPs to help patients ventilate is high in order to reduce injuries and respiratory blockages.
The PEEP methodology is not available for older devices.
The study of a vaccine for the treatment of the epidemic started in January 2020, and several clinical trials have been started.
Remdesivir is the promising drug.

Antiviral drugs may be tested on people who are sick.

As of March 2020, it was not known whether infection caused people who recovered from the pandemic to have a higher long-term immunity.
It appears that the immunity is similar, based on the characteristics of other coronaviruses, but there have been cases of COVID-19 re-infection after reported recovery from the coronavirus.

The disease is thought to be noninfectious and to have originated in animals, where it can be transmitted by organisms.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the disease was transmitted from person to person.
The study of 41 COVID-19 patients, published in the Lancet in January 2020, revealed symptoms of the disease that began to appear on 1 December 2019.
WHO has officially announced the onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
