Welsh MPs are concerned about the similarity to the Mapeths.
Some members of the assembly were overwhelmed by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this could make them the object of ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means fool and pwp means poop.
Plaid MP said the group as a whole was "more satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change but noted that there was little difference between the terms MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee currently working on the draft law on introducing the name change stated: The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on the proposals which resulted in strong support for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it came to the title of Members of the Assembly, the committee preferred the title Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly are reportedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach a consensus could be a headache for Speaker Elina Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the Assembly functions, including rules on disqualification of Assembly members and a plan for the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have one last chance to vote on their names when they debate the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor is a peculiarity of its territory and has consistently opposed its claims to membership in the EU and NATO pact.
Macedonian President Giorgi Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider the name change simply the price they must pay for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
The bells on St. Martin's have gone off as the churches in Harlem struggle to survive.
"The older people I spoke to said there used to be bars and churches on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's neither one.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are different today", he said.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that people go to regularly.
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the property sales won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later, they'll be right back where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who won't help preserve the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and that's why the closing of these churches will be accelerated because the people who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist community moved in in the 1930s.
The black community that worshiped nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black community led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishes made a plan for its restoration, they ordered the organs.
The Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ the "Bells of the Poor".
An expert who played the organ in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these are the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organs at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church couldn't find a replacement for him.
What's been going on at St. Martin's Church over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought in by church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The diocesan administration  the administrative body of the diocese, composed of church leaders  wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would  seek to pass on the costs  to the diocesan administration, although the diocesan administration was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobster in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. outside Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday when he heard a boy crying for help and then he and the group rowed to him and helped him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but then realized he was screaming "It bit me!"
She stung me!
His entire collarbone was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'The shark is in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital where his condition is listed as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined not to be a threatened species.
Giles also added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's Beach in Ecinitas for a period of 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the beauty market in the UK.
Sainsbury's becomes a rival to the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains to department store-style cosmetics departments staffed by professional assistants.
As part of a major breakthrough into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which is on the rise as sales in the fashion and home appliances markets decline, larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
Cosmetic investment is coming as supermarkets find ways to reuse shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will double its cosmetics range by offering more than 3,000 products, including products from brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing product range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space in departments similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its boutique makeup line by making most products vegan-friendly  something increasingly sought after by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance store Fragrance Shop will test outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to daily purchases of smaller quantities of food from local stores mean that supermarkets must make extra efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores in a supermarket push to hit back at the big discount chains Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos department stores in hundreds of its stores, and it's also introduced Habitat departments since buying both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted food sales and sourcing profitability.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to modernize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments ended in disgrace.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenue in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skincare products to its range in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty departments to provide a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and our attractive surroundings and convenient location mean that we are now an indispensable destination for the beauty market that sets new standards for the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal
The star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home appliances and accessories, Truly.
This couple's company has been compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of This Morning (37) announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons star Dan Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her lucrative new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when the television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5m, meant she no longer had time to devote to their home appliances brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Company and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune which was estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday resorts.
A source said Holly has put Truly at the top of her list of priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan to keep her profitable for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has taken everyone involved by surprise.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, there's a warehouse full of products ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home appliances, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as a director of the company.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We would not comment on his business dealings".
Tough words, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he might receive from the media for comments that could be characterized as "unpresidential" and for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump so relentlessly?
Trump said in his witty voice to the news reader.
I didn't give in at all.
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step forward toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see an "adequate response" from the US to North Korea's initial steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to mend relations with Kim had yielded positive results - a halt to missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to negotiating with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island killing hundreds
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pala, they're still not sure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Palu to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, it's unfortunate how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often seen in other parts of the coast.
There was no tsunami warning on the island of Palu, although a tsunami warning was in effect, so that also contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, travel between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to provide relief to earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's ageing infrastructure and spared no money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funds has hit Mr. Joko's administration as it awaits new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced by street fighting between Christian and Muslim groups, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See, Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge has scored a deep equaliser against Chelsea Football Club.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from relegation to the Premier League with an 89th-minute goal Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri some 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left side, and then he kicked it to the outside rack.
The ball was flying high above the penalty area, veering towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually, it fell over Cape Arrizabalg who was jumping and fell into the net.
"It was all about positioning, receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far forward as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
He saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think too much, I just hit the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue forward then gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his heel before running from midfield into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic touched it quickly and returned the ball to the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defence and finished close to the tripod, putting his left foot into the net past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will take on Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play Videotone in the Europa League at three o'clock on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which raised waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling for anyone who saw or heard anything in the area to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with the car's dash cameras, to contact us as they may have information that may be relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found inside the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was left without a line when he found out what happened.
Residents have now been told they will have to wait hours before they are allowed back inside.
They heard a cop tell a man that the whole area was a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of a crime in tears.
She kept saying, "This is so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was right next door.
Most of the officers were inside the police cordon guarding the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, dial 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers hotline at 0800 555 111 citing case 247 as of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest monument amid the controversy over the revision of history.
Removing it would represent poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England by Taliban-style puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would also become a target.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted the Iconfighting during the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft is proof of nineteenth-century opinion and part of the historiography of a character many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than today, to be the protector of Parliament from outside pressures, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and remembrance.
The pig killer inflicted fatal injuries on a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
A man, known only as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pig market in Liupanshui city in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs with the vaccine in a pigsty on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with a cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, a cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with blood all over his mouth.
Forensics confirmed that a 550-pound pig inflicted fatal injuries on the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and dismembered", said a cousin who identified himself as Wu, reports Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market owners are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 on their Massachusetts farm, strangling a man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had hugged a Welsh farmer by his tractor until his wife scared her away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a choking agent.
They're just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't mean you any harm.
You just have to respect them enough, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread downpours to the southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding from downpours across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosina's Category 1 hurricane winds reached 85 miles per hour as of 5:00 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap is forming in the Pacific Ocean and moving toward the east and west coasts of the United States as Tropical Storm Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture along with the coming rift will create widespread downpours in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in flooding, landslides and possible desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will result in rainfall that will locally reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible as a result of a sudden deterioration in weather conditions and the typical scattered tropical rainfall.
Hiking in the desert would be extremely reckless with the danger of tropical rains.
Heavy rain in the canyons could result in wild rivers and locally strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming trough will bring localized downpours to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall of over a half-inch is possible, which could cause landslides and slippery avalanches.
This will be the first rains of the wet season in the region.
A mild, scattered tropical downpour will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The spikes will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, there could be large temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics still remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a great example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States on a Sunday.
The temperature difference in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will again try to accumulate and expand.
Early October will be warm in most of the central and eastern United States with temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast warns of a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's thrilling testimony before the Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, political unrest continues, with broadcasters suspending regular broadcasts due to Friday's latest plot: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake with the FBI for a week-long investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that drunk Kavanaugh touched and tried to undress at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably watched by over 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company counted viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the people who follow the transfer from the office.
To make it more interesting, it's an audience similar to watching a football game or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose editors backed Kavanaugh's nomination, led the network with an average audience of 5.69 million during the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, they said from Nielsen.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured footage of protesters shouting at him after he tried to get into the elevator to attend a judicial committee hearing.
He stood staring down for several minutes as they insulted him, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power whereas so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he had more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and television networks were live-streaming hours later as the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to put Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he'd only do so if the FBI investigates the charges against the nominee next week, as the Democratic minority is calling for.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the daily, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and EU take tariffs from each other was "totally absurd".
Police have arrested Dyton Simpson, a suspect in the death of an LSU football player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson and police said that Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, his lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department said credit goes to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the local residents who helped with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the county's law enforcement agency for its efforts to address greed and the pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what we're always worried about", Wade said.
The volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City.
Ash from the erupting Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been tracking multiple tremors and thunderstorms.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police special forces as thousands joined counter-demonstrations marking the anniversary of the polarizing Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists, held back by a special police unit, threw eggs and paint powder at them, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, clashes broke out with police who used batons to quell the fight.
Independence supporters chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" for hours and clashed with unionists who shouted "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region that has voted for independence a year after an October 1 referendum declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low as opponents of secession boycotted the referendum in droves.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to stop demonstrations and give support to the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
Last year was one of our best.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they were allowed to vote, but now we're in a pinch, he said.
Despite winning a crucial but narrow victory in local elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep pace as some of their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded a demonstration in support of police by phone, said politicians on both sides were fueling the conflict.
"It's getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since late last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European Parliament elections.
'Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and the repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities', he said.
Londonderry: male persons arrested after crashing into a house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after they drove into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday around 7.30pm British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings stated that the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at some point the car was shot with a sawed-off shotgun.
Mantle's goal brought Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Mantle's first goal ensured a win for Livingston
The upgraded Livingston has surprised the Rangers and recorded just the second loss to Steven Gerrard in the Ibrox club's 18 games.
Dolly Mengele's goal was crucial, as Gary Holt's club were tied with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have not recorded a single home win in the Premier League this season and will play first-placed Hearts who are eight points behind next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid from Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended his league winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt hasn't experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against guests who lacked sharpness.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored because their direct play was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made it through, but his shot went past the goal, then Alan Lithgrow's shot went past the goal after he slipped to receive a ball that Craig Halkett headed into the goal.
The hosts were responsible for letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for the visitors from free throws.
And that's how the key goal was scored.
A free kick was scored against the Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Mango, who received the ball and hit from the middle of the penalty area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but the home defense remained impenetrable and goalie Liam Kelly had little trouble.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalie Alan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow kicked too wide from another free kick for Livingston.
Crosses kept coming into Livingston's penalty area and were constantly defended, while two penalties that were sought  one after a foul against substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for hand play  were not awarded.
The phenomenal play of Livingston's analysis
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont is in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a score by Livingston.
All but one were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on the ascending path.
Their style of play and players have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the big credit goes to Holt who has been giving the team energy since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, leading a superbly organized defense, while Meng was all match-time giving Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall peace.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard from time to time, they haven't reached that level.
Missing the final kicks... they only got through the home line once... and this is kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29) was marked by smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They split on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city with the largest number of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security measures as the reason to block 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  many of them Kurds  were also vocal, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The double protests reflect a split in opinion about a guest whom some German Turks hail as a hero, while others resent him for being an autocrat.
A cyclist has been killed in a collision with a car.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a major road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car pulled over and an ambulance team intervened, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.
The collision happened several months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, which is about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
London police said they were working on identifying the victim and informing the family.
Streets are closed, buses diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riot
Six correctional officers were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, on Sunday around 0930 British time and are still ongoing.
A special task force of Tornado officers has been called in to quell a riot involving eight inmates in one wing of the prison.
Officers suffered minor facial injuries and were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "We have deployed specially trained prison staff to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been given medical attention for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may be given longer prison sentences.
Long Lartin Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was announced that the warden had been admitted to hospital for treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, a special task force was called to the prison for a serious riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City.
It's rare for tropical depressions to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's most likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa with its remaining energy moves through the desert southwest, carrying with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will signal rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts from the National Hurricane Center are predicting 2 to 4 inches of rain, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rim, Arizona, up to 6 inches.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated areas.
In areas where there is no threat of flooding, the rain from Rosa could be a blessing as the area is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be useful as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Drought Control, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First on its way, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still expected to reach hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and cause it to begin to limp.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The downpours in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a major risk of flooding.
Total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and possibly as much as 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remnants is heavy downpours in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the American Southwest Desert, "the National Hurricane Center said.
These showers are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and landslides in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Four people arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4am British time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials are asking anyone with any footage of the event to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the wrath and the wrath" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's cruel and unprecedented tactics", Trump said at a rally in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "endured the wrath and the wrath" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying claims by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted them decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished record in public service", he told a supporter group in West Virginia.
The president made a point of indirectly touching on Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican midterm elections.
Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
"Even though I'm not running personally, I'm actually running", he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates.
Trump claims the Democrats are trying to "provide resistance and disruption".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number is still rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them washed up on beaches by huge waves as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the shore at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they died", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, in a speech in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it carried cars, boulders, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled across the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area home to 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It's possible that the geographical position of the city, which sits on the edge of a long, narrow bay, increased the tsunami's strength, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, in Donggala province, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications were completely cut off with no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though officials said the waves arrived in time for the warning.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on an upper floor panickingly warning people on the street below of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, hampering rescue efforts by authorities.
The military has begun sending humanitarian aid planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for humanitarian flights only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
Although World Vision staff had safely arrived from Donggala in Palu, where staff were housed in tents erected in the office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief groups began taking the first steps in disaster relief, there was a complaint that foreign highly skilled aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign resources, supplies and people is only possible if the crash site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we'll be open to international assistance, but that status hasn't been declared yet.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami hits on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously rescued and that their harrowing story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has been training two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior member of the paragliding team I carry my emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread to paragliding circles, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who were attending a beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray clutch instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
On Friday morning, according to a Newport Police report, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran after Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to a statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "He will be known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used the name for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to promote his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande who canceled her show for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti", West said earlier this year while discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It's from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye, which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, Jay-Z, also used the comma-free and capital letters version.
AMLO in Mexico vowed not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would never use the military to subdue the Mexican people.
The military opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to provide support to young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities pushed young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in the field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government issued announcements on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: to be the number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in AI will happen in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an artificial intelligence system that proved superior to America's highest-ranking Othello player, and later was CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged earlier US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when they plan on holding the next competitions where future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to go to great lengths to get government grants, Lee said.
"China doesn't take away our academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired some brilliant individuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the United States consolidate its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese State Council released its plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense formed the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Selection Board.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature that has been trying to form a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence for months has done nothing.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the identity of its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could jeopardize the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Giorgi Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has raised the question of whether the minimum 50 percent turnout needed to make the referendum valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of membership of the NATO alliance and the EU with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will be guided by the outcome of the vote and that the result will be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when a total of 66 percent of voters turned out.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe", said Djoses Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko vote in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that could pave the way for them to join the NATO alliance and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of tents that were hung by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not at the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor but proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote 'Yes' because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the ballot.
He said the result would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll released on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum  which is below the required turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would vote "yes".
For a referendum to be successful, it requires a turnout of 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to a pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Look, Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the whole of Brighton's defence and scores.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have rid themselves of Brighton's defence in a 2-0 Manchester City win against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three of Brighton's defensive players before he found himself in the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by three green jerseys.
He pushed around one of the defensive players and was faster than a few others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he added to the left side, finding Sterling.
The England striker used his first kick from the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right-handed kicker overpowered Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero had some foot problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Skywalkers the starting lead in the Premier League's turmoil.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's side of the field.
He's a beautiful addition to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Snee touched a few times before he sent Sterling to the goal.
The sky blue forward put the ball in the net before it slipped off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a no-competition game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated in the divisional round, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to take a position Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in the playoffs.
The Rockies have a direct lead with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win their first league title.
"We're not playing for nothing, "even though we can go out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will probably be at the highest level of any team this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under those conditions?
The Nationals still have to announce their starting lineup for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who's about to start his 34th game, was training Thursday and will pitch Sunday when he usually rests.
The Washington righty is 18-7 this season with a 2.53 earned run average, 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president briefly addressed the election of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republicans coming out in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important decision of our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones. Even though I didn't run, I'm actually a candidate because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump went on, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, this is happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power using all sorts of means, you see, malicious, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to get power and control, power and control is what they want, and we're not gonna give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to resist and disrupt.
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, evil and dishonest.
He named Democratic Senator and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, a name that prompted a loud public outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting. That was really bad body language.
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
She's intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, I wasn't at all surprised.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome, all because we've expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly for her strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censors for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The announcement from the Nottingham East Labour Party branch meeting on Friday read: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years I spent as a local Labour MP, Friday night meetings were mostly just like this.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not that and the promise of kinder, gentler policies has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it ever was.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started not long after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who I believed shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a 180-degree turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with, whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak publicly  and it doesn't matter what I say  it's accompanied by a flurry of insults on social media, calls to be removed from the party, condemnations of the centre-left politics and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a barrage of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but don't back down.
One of the things that disappointed me most about this political age is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different views and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of selection the party narrows.
I've had a lot of advice, and for the last two years, they've been telling me to lower my head, be less vocal, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a pupil 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government that literally brought down my primary school classroom, I have sought to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that, as the country is racing towards Brexit that will jeopardise our homes, our jobs and our public services, I do not understand why anyone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that threats of expulsion from the party or political trickery will not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat skewed the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr took a well-deserved win in this exciting match of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the home team won thanks to superior defense and more chances, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr, congratulations, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Naderson's 14th-minute shot that converted Frazier Climo gave Ayra the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unassisted shot.
Climo's penalty increased Ayr's lead before, just before halftime, he scored a solo try which turned into a 17-5 halftime score for Ayr.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt to convert Baggot cut the lead to five points.
Then came a long break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was carried on a stretcher, and Ayr then increased the lead with a try from Stafford McDowall, who converted Climo.
Ayra's vice-captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again used the numerical lead with an unassisted attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts also fought back when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a foul over Clim without a ball.
Climo turned, as he had done almost since the start of the series, after Kyle Rowe picked up a punch from David Armstrong in the penalty area and sent off a winger from Gregor Henry for the hosts' fifth try.

The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series for which he writes the script and stars alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper hinted that Kiernan wants to get involved in the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling the naval base at La Paz.
The flags are waving on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: "We have a right to the sea".
Getting the sea back is our duty.
Across mainland Bolivia, there is still a strong memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century war for natural resources as well as a longing to once again flood the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has taken the lead, in a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia and argue that  after decades of convulsive negotiations  Chile must agree to negotiations to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous descent, facing a controversial re-election bid next year, also has a big stake in the verdict due on Monday.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory and has said it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the verdict comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have held it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian authorities", Zarate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has killed the rest of Chile's goodwill, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement for mutual satisfaction", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  is using the issue of going to sea as a political stick.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to move on from the past.
North Korea says they won't disarm until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his people will not disarm unless they trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made during the Singapore summit between the conflicting leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of reopening deadlocked nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's just a dream come true that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not prepared to agree to a declaration until Pyongyang makes significant progress toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness in renouncing its nuclear arsenal, which it likely sees as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show presents the latest line of giant hats that you'll soon see on the nearby shopping street
If you're looking to expand your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, you've come to the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of wacky giant hats on the runways of their 2019 spring and summer shows, eclipsing everything else at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have been showcasing their impressive creations on the runways.
Valentine's most prominent piece was an over-emphasized hat with a wide feathered rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons with ornamental stones, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but their purpose is not to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving kit with a blowtorch and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you're one of those people who's following the attention-grabbing trend, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that giant hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The giant hats came after "La Bombe", a two-foot-long-brimmed straw hat that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that designed this very impractical hat that flooded social media has sent another big creation onto the runway -- a straw beach bag that's almost as big as the model that wore it.
The orange-purple raffia bag with lace and white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the big hats and beach bags to hit stores in time for next summer, as the designer has made such a huge impression it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized fashion accessories".
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a record of outstanding academic achievement, which continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding test scores, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, careers of their choice and a place in the society of world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and preferred elective subject for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it pleases his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build good relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Judging by the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A's on their high school final exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored A's in Mandarin on their high school final exam, while 72 percent of German language learners, 69 percent of French language learners and 63 percent of Spanish language learners also scored A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electives, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) in the independent school curriculum, and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers gave for difficulty filling jobs were lack of foreign language skills.
So knowledge of foreign languages is becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With a growing number of potential jobs requiring knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career you choose, knowing a second language will have a real advantage in the future because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks multiple languages ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 Britons in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a second language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in foreign language learning is so important for kids today.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to the language they teach.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more relevant to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a few languages to choose from in independent schools, with specialist language teachers.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
In this day and age, there is no denying that in a global business environment, language is crucial to the future of a country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
You gotta do it right.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still unclear how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games during the Lakers' preseason.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of pre-election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies scheduled for next week including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote is pending to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When's the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven o'clock tonight Eastern time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court, which have been fraught with sexual harassment allegations, and an expected Senate vote has been delayed by a week until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the overriding goal of this rally is to help the Republicans get a better result in the November election.
So President Trump's campaign said the rallies this week are being held to give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, declining to be identified.
Scheduled for Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to a report by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, who is not doing well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to try to boost his polling", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swing swing is a completely made-up concept in sports, but one that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got the momentum right now?
"They're up six points, now four, so you can say the momentum is on our side", Jordan Spieth said as he left.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points up, with 12 to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there are plenty of things that give them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points out of a possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from first to last and leads by example.
The cheers grew louder throughout his round, until he finally played the key shot to tie the game in the fourth when he and Thomas trailed two to two.
His final shot to win the 15-hole match was met with a similar cheer, one that reflected a belief that there was hope for the American team.
"You just have to give your best and take care of your sword", Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but irresistible European pair has won all four matches and is playing without a single error.
The Mollywoods were the only pair to miss the bogey on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes of Friday morning.
The game they've shown so far and the way they've exchanged energy with the noisy crowd have cemented them as the main favourites for Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari to take away a potential European victory as the sun sets over the grounds of Le Golf National.
It's best to be both on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about a European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat out Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't even get out of until the end.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-quarter game is so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and the ways in which strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a big lead going into the final day, but this four-way session also showed that the U.S. team has a fighting spirit that some have questioned, especially on the American mainland.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enter the final Ryder Cup with a significant lead after Saturday's four-ball and four-ball game gave them a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, took the lead with two victories over the dissatisfied Tiger Woods, increasing their record at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's Europeans, in a bid to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in the morning four-ball game and won the series 3-1.
The United States provided the strongest opposition in the four-man tournament, winning two matches, but could not close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs to win eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four matches.
After overtaking Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they put together a great run to overcome a tired Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more convincing 5-4 lead.
Woods, who had two shutouts on Saturday, had his moments of brilliance, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games in a four-ball, four-quarter, seven-game streak.
Juston Rose, who was resting during the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henry Stenson in the four-ball tournament and suffered a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepke  the world number one and number three.
Europe was not going as planned on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point field goal for the Americans on Saturday.
They narrowly beat Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2-1 in a four-ball game, only to later come back and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit before a single game, even though Furyk's defending champion side has a draw enough to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, it seems they cannot counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says there's talk of unilateral disarmament if there's no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there has been no appropriate response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no question of us disarming first unilaterally".
While Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for gradual steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not dismiss unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had done previously.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the incumbent US president and the North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also defied calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is not giving up on 'denuclearization first' and is increasing the pressure level with sanctions to force its way through, even opposing 'declaring an end to the war,'" Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader had talked about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If we had negotiated this denuclearization issue with South Korea, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end".
However, the tone of Rio's speech was drastically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's ground-based missile attack on the US was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile-suicide" on a suicide mission.
At this year's United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea implements denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying: "If it takes, let it take two years, three years or five months. It doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they've taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and uncompromisingly enforced until complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours for making "gangster" demands.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He stated that Kim told him that "appropriate measures" were required to meet the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to get students to sleep more in an effort to root out the increasingly popular macho culture of "all-night caffeinated learning".
One academic noted that students at the world's top university are often ignorant of basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course he believes is the only one of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course came from a talk he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was - which surprised me - he told The Telegraph.
This year's course, which is being offered for the first time, provides students with a basic understanding of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and athletic performance and improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was noticed that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a room in a dorm, and students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routines.
In the second part, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know  just as you have a right to know what the health effects of your decision to smoke are", said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "sleepless nights" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep, and quality sleep, should be the secret weapon of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Even overweight, he said, is a problem because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his lectures during his freshman year at Harvard last year.
He says this course has opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate for its maintenance on a campus-wide basis.
He hopes the next step is to require all postgraduates to complete a similar program of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting their alarm at bedtime and wake up time and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, thus leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: Meng's goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressing home loss when Dolly Meng sent a punch by Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were keen to take their first home win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat as manager in 18 games, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premier League leaders Hearts.
Mengi scored seven minutes into halftime, and the uninspired Rangers lineup never even came close to a tie.
While the Rangers have now dropped to sixth, Livingston has moved up to third and they are only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after linebacker Calum Spence had to be helped when he was hit from the side with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes in a team that beat Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt has committed to the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained team has pushed the opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
They came close to scoring just two minutes after Meng sent Scott Pittman into the empty space with his first goal, but the midfielder missed a big shot and kicked the goal.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free kick then found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to kick past the goal, near the tripod.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their play in the final third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have gotten a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers had just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly defended Lassane Coulibaly's header without much difficulty and tamed a shot from Ovie Ejarri.
While Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true balance of power during the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if for nothing else, then for the effort put in.
The Rangers again couldn't handle Jacobs' deep free throw.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerrard responded to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent in place of Coulibaly and that substitution paid off almost immediately when the winger hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to get the guests to play exactly as they pleased, with Lithgow and Halkett's long balls.
Holt's side had a chance to increase their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor held on tight and defended Jacobs' attack, before Lithgow headed the ball away from the corner.
Rangers' backup Glenn Middleton, late in the game, asked for another penalty when he got stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson again failed to respond.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a station from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882 on this day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually become the device known as the Geiger counter.
As well as being one of the main pillars of science, the Geiger counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Coronation Bell, starring the seemingly incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that?
It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms through your ears, thanks to the radioactivity in minerals.
Yeah, that's a lot of crap.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot malignant cells and then kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the therapy.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from patients and replacing them in the lab
They can see a protein that's common in many types of cancer, and then they inject themselves again.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient, processing them in the lab so they can see the HER2 protein, and then injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute of Malignant Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several cancers" including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them to target malignant cells has been effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a fierce speech of support for Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a boastful performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, and that evening wearing a "Make America Great" hat, he insulted Democrats and again spoke of his support for Trump.
I've talked to white people so many times who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
If I cared about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, a recording of West's speech was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to embarrass West by posting the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of the hat.
I was teased behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head".
They were teasing me!
And then they say I'm a loser, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that he's going to take off Superman's cloak because that means you can't order me around.
Try love.
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and SNL's crew members were visibly humiliated, Variety reported, with one person who was present saying, "The whole studio went completely silent".
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing "I Love It" disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not standing up to the bullies".
But host Karen Hunt tweeted that West was simply who he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to the symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after a person was stabbed in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in the Ballyhackamore neighborhood, police said.
The accused are expected to appear in Belfast Misdemeanour Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington has condemned the toxic macho culture
Keith Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-wielding mastermind in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor lashed out at the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles mean that boys very often feel they need to be rude to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Leslie Rose, 31, admitted that he has a "strong need" to address this problem.
"I'm personally quite troubled right now by the question of what we did wrong with the portrayal of masculinity", he said.
What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of a toxic macho culture by portraying characters who pose as males.
He said, "What is birth and what is the matter of upbringing?"
What is it that we are taught on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young men.
He also admitted in an interview that he would not agree to any previews or sequels for Game of Thrones after it ended the following summer, saying that he was "done with the battlefields and the horses".
Keith is set to star in Sam Shepard's play True West in November, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he feels meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that's ever happened to Game of Thrones.
"In this series I met my wife, so you could say she gave me a future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love partner of Keith's character Jon Snow in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's parents' estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases among citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sexual contact, which is a change from the previous situation.
In the past, HIV usually spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a burning issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative attitudes in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Transmission is also often caused by inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied claims that any of her staff members have leaked information on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters has denied allegations that any of her staff members posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles claims that these claims are being made by experts and the ultra-right wing website.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The information released allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came just after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and posted information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and inaccurate claims is not responsible in any way for disclosing this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement prompted an online condemnation, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial breathes out anger", wrote Fleischer.
This leads me to conclude that she lacks the temperament required for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He can't be insolent.
He can't question the prosecution's motives.
They have to be calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters's reaction to criticism of Democratic Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
"Big deal if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "the relevant authorities and judicial authorities to these false allegations".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and held accountable for all their actions which are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Johnny English back in action. A soft spy parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It has become a tradition to look for a Brexit subtext in every new British-themed film, which can be applied to this sequel to the satirical action comedy franchise about Johnny English, which began back in 2003 with the release of Johnny English and returned to the screens in 2011 with the sequel Johnny English: Born Again.
Will the ironic self-portrait of how obviously useless we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, the staring, incompetent rubber-faced Johnny English has been given another chance to screw up something, with his name more than anything revealing that it is a general comic creation designed for territories with a cinema audience whose native language is not English.
It's, of course, about a silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to the highest glamour, wears a little Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a crumb of the guy who played just one note in the theme tune to the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It was also originally based on the traveller and international man wrapped in a veil of secrecy that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest venture are good.
I loved when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval knightly armor and when the rotor blades briefly rustled on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way superfluous, especially now that serious film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible confidently add comic elements.
I realize this is a children's humor, not an adult one, and to me Johnny English's wacky adventures aren't as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent-film-style Mr. Bean gags.
Now it's a very topical issue that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, much to the horror of the acting agent - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for the prime minister, a pompous and dispirited character already experiencing a complete collapse due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this Theresa May-inspired character, but the script is rather meager.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised and she will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the goofy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but unofficially gives lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting geeks when English runs a spy academy in the style of the movie School of Rock.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for emergency instruction and to be reunited with his former immensely patient partner Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role as Vicki Pepperdine is little used.
So Batman and Robin for screwing up things are back in the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and the fortune of the beautiful, fatal wife Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of comic adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a stylish French restaurant, create chaos in secret by boarding the Walt's luxury yacht, and English sets off a veritable anarchy by trying to get inside the Walt's house using virtual reality headphones.
Obviously, a lot of effort was put into that last sequence, but as cute and cheerful as it was, the whole movie felt like it was made for kids.
It's a pretty mediocre quality.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry devise a role for Rowan Atkinson that really shows his talent?
The Labour Party denies it's making a plan for the British people to work four days a week and get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan where the British work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on time saved by the AI revolution to workers by giving them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend but still get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic programme and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year".
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy in general.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a policy of the party and the party is not considering it".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour Party conference last week to lay out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has said he is determined to take power from the hands of the impersonal directors and profiteers of the utility companies.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recoup their entire investment because Labour could impose "deductions" based on perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds that would allocate 10 percent of the value of private sector companies to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy speak on 60 Minutes about whether an FBI investigation might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's investigation could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more forthcoming than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think, of course", said Kennedy.
Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came in, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unambiguous.
However, Senator Graham's voice seems to be cemented.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is formed and a strong indictment would be necessary", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied it vigorously", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And anyone she names can't confirm that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of performing stars, and an equally impressive goal: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the vast Central Park lawn to not only enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's true purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Project Against Poverty, an international group that advocates for ending poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, and any other meaningful way to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a citizen of the world project with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince people to do something, or just another form of so-called "clicktivism" where people believe they've done something that will change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Citizens of the World initiative claims to have recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters advocating for a range of different causes.
They say these actions have led world leaders to announce promises and policies worth more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group listed 390 pledges and disclosures arising from their actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already directly impacted 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are Power of Food, a partnership of UK investors and developers who have pledged to help children grow to their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historic footnote", Power Food Ambassador Tracey Ullman told live concert-goers in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced it would fund the Power of Food project, whose interventions will touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their site, which was, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The world citizen replies, "It's going to be a long and hard journey, and sometimes we'll fall and slip.
But like all the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States Navy could block Russia from exporting energy.
Washington can use its navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian involvement in Syria  namely, being there at the invitation of the legitimate government  provides an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe and Central Southern Europe", he is alleged to have said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States has the ability to work with our Navy to ensure that the sea corridors remain open or block them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace the fuel", he said, saying that Russia has only one asset, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia as a far more favorable option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump would make Berlin a "hostage" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion and designed to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's sharp opposition to this project are purely economic in nature and that it represents an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers", Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Confederation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, Massachusetts state senator said.
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the next midterm elections.
During a meeting at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to a source at The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren called President Donald Trump out during a meeting at City Hall, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was called in because of criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, polling results released Thursday showed that a majority of the electorate who voted for Warren do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who are "likely" to vote in Massachusetts said a senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed that there is more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of voters supporting the potential candidacy and 48 percent against the candidacy.
Other high-profile Democratic names being discussed in terms of their potential 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, as reported by The Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about PTSD from Track Palin at a rally in support of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence following an incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he comes back, I can relate to what's happening to other families who are suffering from PTSD and the vulnerability that our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a rally in support of President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "hot topic" and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, added that the Jones are coming back a little different, coming back stronger, coming back wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other service members have given to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - assault on a female person, obstruction of domestic violence reporting and possession of a firearm while under the influence of opiates, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenging the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a review of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a court-friendly report Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal police has not been released.
She said she was abused by her partner and violent members of his gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in a Texas holding cell.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, face a growing problem of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and that the Chamber in doing so violates that principle", the friendly report states.
Lawyers further argue that police who prevent immigrants from entering the country are harming the U.S. economy and are likely to turn them into entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
State Attorney Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available only to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear because of their membership in a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion", Sessions said in a June 11 statement on politics.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the death toll doubles in search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, the ambulance is bringing bodies in.
The government lacks clean water".
Residents are returning to their destroyed homes, searching through flooded things trying to salvage anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals devastated by the 7.5-magnitude quake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, are being housed outside the Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to the continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he recounts how he felt a powerful earthquake rattle his hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the walls", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
The US ambassador accuses China of "violence through propaganda ads".
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid addition of the Chinese newspaper China Daily to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marks, US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
And while it's common for foreign governments to issue ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war where they are raising tariffs on each other's imports.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war have targeted exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime mayor of Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary published in the Des Moines Register Sunday edition, "is now doubling down on this violence by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America's precious tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the kiosk located here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's troubled economic path, keeping in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are discouraging women from voting ahead of the midterm elections with Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn.
Analysts have warned that many of the most prominent Republicans who defend and support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, will experience backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue are very intense and most Republicans have already shown that they want to cast their vote.
There's no going back on these things", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in a magazine article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute request for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, in a statement to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to push ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous", said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided suburban women voters and younger voters between 18 and 29 who, while they don't like the president, don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the alleged sexual assault charge against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts were of the opinion that there could be backlash if Republicans persisted with the nomination.
"This has become a major mess for the Big Old Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic-led group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
Yet, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided as to who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, slightly leaning towards Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought the same about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who brought the charge, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while attending parties during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt's intent was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of them are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about a personal online data store is that it's completely up to the user who can access what types of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, a number of staffed development engineers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology engineers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to implement a complete overhaul where all their business models are completely destroyed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission".
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide a commercial powerhouse and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new Web built on Solid".
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victory Cross awarded to a priest in World War I
A celebration in honour of the only Church of England priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won the honour on September 29th, 1918 for the attack on the towns of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had won Britain's highest military honour.
At a parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal through very thick fog and under heavy battlefield and machine gun fire".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with "greatest heroism" led the platoon forward before he single-handedly charged into the Polish cannon and cut down three of the troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never reach, but also something that challenges obedience".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "honored to be part of the parade" adding that "the bravery of a true hero shows the support that many will give".
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 get Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that, you stay up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches, only to end up missing the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main roster and was shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was interrupted by Peppa Pig.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning just to fight.
One fan on Twitter described the cartoon interruption as a kind of sick joke".
"It's a government regulation that says at 6 a.m. that content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a kids show", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig", yeah.
Bellator president Scott Coker said he'll work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I talk about rehearsals, I think we can probably work it out", Coker said.
Well, the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to get anything done until Sunday when it's already Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the break came, there was a lot of correspondence and everyone was hostile.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a matter for the government.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're gonna reduce the number of fights from six to five, like we usually do, we tried to give our fans more, but we went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality.
Olympic cyclist Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said it wasn't until high school that he realized that not everyone was like me".
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the program, Kirsty Young, was away for several months due to illness.
Appearing as a backstabber on the first Laverne show, Daley said that growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, those feelings of worthlessness and feeling different were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was somebody", he said, so people wouldn't be disappointed when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequence and because he wanted to give others hope".
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, and said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much when you're so young" - he made his first Olympic appearance when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find someone his age who has had similar ups and downs.
The pair were cast as the parents of Robert Ray's boy Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie".
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to swim in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
This served as inspiration for his choice of first song - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated with him as he prepared for the Olympics and which still makes him cringe.

Mickelson out of form on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back in shape before this is a sad turning point.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial for a record 12th time, was sent off on the bench by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's game with four balls and a game to spare.
Instead of being the center of the action, as was often the case for the U.S., the five-time major winner spent the day cheering and improving range in the game, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding course of Le Golf National, where long, uneven terrain regularly punishes stray shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson is in Game 9 on Sunday against British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who, on the team of rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are 12 games out of the game with four points to spare, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow", Furyk said.
He believes in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's the way it went, and we thought that's the way it was supposed to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team", he explained.
I think it was fun for the younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving away a lot more than just a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage on the final day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his first appearance in a match played in the city of Valderrama in 1997, when the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a narrow 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won", said Bjorn, imagined after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history and everyone on this team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going all the way tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you score points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's what the focus remains.
I'm talking all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's across the road on the other side - the greatest players in the world".
Enthusiastic about his players' performance in a tough golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this get me down.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow is the singles match, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you're testing your own ultimate abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you have to give the players. Give it your best shot tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too".
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better singles than they did doubles, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Suryk himself was on both ends of these big turns on the final day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser after Europe performed the "miracle" in Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, cheered his players on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you should be looking to get great results right at the start like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When he starts with a pass like that, he puts a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We've formed our lineup accordingly and we've got the guys ready so we're gonna try to do some magic tomorrow, you know.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half.
"I went with this group of guys in this outfit because I think they can cover the whole thing", Bjorn said of singles player selection.
New German warship on standby again
The German Navy's new frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but will not arrive for at least another year due to system failures and extraordinary costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery jeopardised the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to deploy for up to two years without returning to home ports.
Yet, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were supposed to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the ship unusable if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half the number of people who operated the old Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it turned out that the ship was significantly overweight which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne ship is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, also becomes problematic.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the navy was in fact "running out of ships that could be deployed".
The official said that this problem has grown over time because the old ships have been scrapped and no replacement ships have been procured.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
A new study conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape in search of food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide for future conservation activities.
The study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bat and the soprano pipistrelle, and the brown long-eared bat and the daubenton bat at Inverwe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at the NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which negatively affect their spawning and habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct checks, inspections of the nest, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave's estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a large bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the good habitats.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and at other estates will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of checking for bats on the property, since accidental destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and young, likely leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to get involved and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the populations of most of our species evolve".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has characterized the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram Live video, hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports as fake news.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today, it's fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal. I know.
They want to get famous by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they called "unacceptable reporting on privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "non-material damage in an amount commensurate with the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on one knee after the alleged incident and told her that he was a 99% good guy who was let down by the 1%
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital photographed her injuries, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she's now seeking a mistrial because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" what Toyota UK told the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its Burnston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays if Brexit goes no deal could cause job losses.
The Burnston plant that makes the Toyotin Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production stop at our factory,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnston.
Other UK manufacturers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about how cross-border trade would work if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates on the "just in time" principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border which could lead to delays and parts shortages, according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those border checks".
"We need to have an agreement.We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a highly successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness in the market and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnston for 24 years and is president of the Unite union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when jobs like this go down, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We must put forward a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the fight continues over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the case of Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby jeopardize Mr. Mueller's independence, has been a topic of discussion in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also discussed wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has dismissed these rumors.
But last Monday, he was in the White House, in the middle of rumors that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that featured Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied, "The date for that has not yet been set, it could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week given all the other things that are happening regarding the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press to always be informed.
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not given a brief press conference at the White House since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders responded that the fewer short speeches were not due to a dislike of "theatrical behavior" by TV journalists, although she said, "I'll agree with the fact that they're exaggerating".
Then she said that there would be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president has more question and answer sessions than any president before him", she said without citing evidence.
Short speeches will still be held, Sanders said, but while the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that as much as we can, and you've seen us do that for the last couple of weeks, and these talks with the president of the United States will replace brief press appearances".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences when visiting officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, by behaving in front of a gathering of reporters in a wild and sometimes bizarre manner.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland about fears about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimburse the costs of resolving the status applications of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued over the summer, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a very, very turbulent time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much wish you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defensive lineman Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after injuring his head in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee State's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the field line and just crashed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he "has no details on the type/scale of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before being ejected from the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when buying property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under new Conservative plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
Higher taxes will be charged to those who don't pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved in trying to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and focus on those who earn more.
Higher taxes will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay UK taxes, with the additional money reinforcing the Government's intention to fight sleeping outdoors.
The additional fee, which is in addition to the existing tax, including multiple tiers, introduced two years ago on other real estate and purchase for rent, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to increase revenue to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to become homeowners.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help more young people get to their first homes.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land they don't use at the first opportunity, and asked Mrs May to give up the affordable housing quota as soon as possible to end Britain's "shame" housing policy.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and a halt to unprovoked evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my term as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that the lives of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life in it.
Still, it cannot be right that non-UK individuals, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses as easily as British property owners.
The dream of homeownership has become too far away for many people, and the inhuman sleeping outdoors remains very real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to be the manager of the Scottish national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of bringing the North East club back to life, who are currently in third place in the Premier League, three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was on the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always brought me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I was successful in running the club".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel uneasy about coming after such big names at such a big club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of my success at this point will be 'will I manage to get this club back into the Premier League?'
Judging by the structure and capabilities of this club, he definitely belongs in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only consider myself successful if I can get the club back to where it belongs.
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the Hartz coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and pulled St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled taking over the Alloa Club.
I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than acting.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living and I enjoyed some solid success.
But acting can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just responds.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a drink is Saturday at 5:30, research shows.
The summer heat wave has boosted traffic at Britain's pubs struggling to survive, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars group saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, but restaurant traffic fell by 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said: "The persistent sunny weather and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern to the previous June, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase and restaurants saw an even bigger drop.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant traffic in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinking performed by far the best with higher growth compared to comparable results in the previous period than was the decline in restaurant traffic.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Pubs and bars saw a 6.6% increase in beverage sales in a month, with food sales down 3%.
Paul Newman, of the entertainment and hospitality analytics agency RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The Commission established that the Union industry was in a difficult situation in the period considered.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% annual drop in sales will be particularly painful with price pressures already present.
The long hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for food-focused diners, and the weather will tell if the milder temperatures we had in August will provide some much-needed relief.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slower growth in the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry-wide sales tracking service for the UK pubs and restaurants sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is an accepted industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents and teachers, research reveals
A survey of over 20,000 high school students found a rise in fake Instagram pages.
That news has raised fears of releasing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a master order showing their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a surge in fake Instagram accounts, which refer to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has fueled fears of releasing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean primary account that they showed their parents, but they also had private accounts.
One mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenager calling out to others, "rape me".
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, while half admitted to having private accounts.
HMC president Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create a space on the internet where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athlete in the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at that body's annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated female athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her rich experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys the great respect of the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her membership of the committee", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the sportsman and I hope I can really contribute to sport in Scotland".
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals, including victories in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, has been left immobilized after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover and how long.
It was a tough job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An advertisement for a traitor comparing mothers to cows has been shared online
The company that makes the trailers has shared the opinions on the Internet with an ad comparing the milkmaids to the cows of the mules.
To mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent milk pump", consumer technology firm Elvie has released an ad inspired by a fun music video that shows the freedom a new pump provides to mothers who give milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn amongst hay and cows to a song that says, "Yes, I'm a man but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wimp, it's my breasts".
Here's the chorus: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, husband myself".
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has elicited mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the dairy industry's exploits.
Using a cow to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to conceive and give birth like us to produce milk, but they take their babies away a few days after they're born, someone wrote.
The Elvie release pump discreetly fits into the breastplate.
Another commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use it to advertise a traitor for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "Advertising without meaning".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "crazy".
I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I was still breastfeeding.
Betrayal made me feel like a cow.
The commercials are a little silly, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product, someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a ridiculous ad aimed at moms who give milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows".
This is not an ad that praises or brags about the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they've all been dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of the ad is based on the fact that many mothers who give milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, with no wires or tubes, and fits into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while they're giving milk.
Ana Ballarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between a suckler and a cow, we wanted to focus on the delivery of milk and all the challenges that come with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on a runway designed by Martha Jakubowska using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being smuggled into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to find a guardian for the children.
Traditionally, most caregivers have been undocumented migrants themselves who fear risk their ability to stay in the country by coming forward to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective guardians and other adult members of their household would be required to take fingerprints and share that data with immigration.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress last week that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior convictions.
Nearly 80% of people who are either guardians or members of the guardians' household are illegal in this country, and a good portion of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we're going to continue the search for these individuals, Mr. Albenze said.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules that require some children to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, shelter workers say.
Many will answer by video call instead of in person to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those found not to meet the criteria will be deported quickly.
The longer children are locked up, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, shelter workers and reports coming in from the system in recent months point out.
Lawyers say that such risks are heightened in larger facilities like the one in the city of Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook signs that a child is in trouble.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause the trauma that many children already struggle with.
Syria demands the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be dealt with accordingly".
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said in the hearing.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over, where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the global fight" until we eliminate all Syrian terrorists, including terrorist groups and "any foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, tasked primarily with training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that there are good conditions for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be wiped out.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the body's work should be limited to "considering the articles of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of outside interference.
Why Trump will be elected to a second term
By that logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal ended his term earlier.
That would undoubtedly represent the most dramatic end to a presidential term in history.
So far, there's no sign of the audience's fatigue.
Since 2014, the hit-date ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers on prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's the fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama "Selected Survivors", about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of Only the Funny Parts: And a Few Cruel Truths About Getting Involved in the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington can decide the future of abortion laws like Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and what the state of the global economy will be.
Being excluded is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you've gone a little further than the general information when you realize that you've spent six hours watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used deep background sources for his book Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 mussel-skin jacket and the implications of the pictorial descriptions, this, anatomy, of Mr. Trump given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what it does to make it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "The Secret Room", commenting on the cast rotation and the day-to-day intrigues of Trump's show (criticism of the NFL, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of about 80 degrees, but he was locked in and watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future on the Supreme Court was uncertain.
I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people would say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

A huge influx of foreign money in the most uncertain midterm race for the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to a redistribution of congressional districts that has resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
The recent redrawing of the district boundaries in the Pittsburgh suburbs has led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took over the second district after a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against the other incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th District has triggered a campaign finance battle between the major party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a widely-watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then pulling out.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions are only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include both cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be hard on this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a follow-up to a similar summit last year that represented a step forward in efforts to stem the influx of migrants into the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended any consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the administration's importance to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
The history
Next up could be a report by special investigator Robert Mueller on possible Trump obstruction of justice, which is now substantiated in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reported to have focused his investigation on uncovering a possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia's attack on the election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to re-enter the voters' courtroom, and perhaps the jury.
There's a lot of silence, though, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump, or those in Europe like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only for the West to oppose him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history turns around such tipping points, and the relentless march of democracy speeds up or slows down.
Americans are now facing more of these tipping points.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a perilous position since this paper last year reported that he had proposed a secret video of the president and speculated that he was unfit to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times's statement is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the recently commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is upheld despite compelling sexual assault and perjury charges?
And on top of all that, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we won't fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I am ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candle on that table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing the Rapids from Vienna
Rangers are hosting the Rapido from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrance out of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he is confident the Rangers can use that as a springboard.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could do something and we walked away with a point.
We might have been able to take them all the way, but all in all, the draw is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second and we were better.
We're back for another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough match because they had a good performance in the last game, although, with the support of the crowd, we can certainly push and get a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened with my injuries and changing the club itself, but now we're happy with what we have.
The team is in good shape and the guys are really enjoying it; we're training well.
I hope we can now move on, put the past season behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep worrying about saving for retirement
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they'd discussed it with their children.
"People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get it, as such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own savings - provided you have enough money.
Get your legal documents in order: prevent legal battles at the root.
Make a medical decision authorization so that you have an authorized person of trust to oversee the medical care you receive and ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Consider also concluding a power of attorney agreement for financial matters.
That means choosing a person you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and to take care of paying your bills if you become powerless.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a medical emergency and needs to be rushed to the hospital.
Could you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Put the details in a written plan so you're prepared.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are", Martin asked.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it out.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were cut off, emergency officials were unable to get any information from Donggala Province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The county, which is administratively a lower-tier province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that washed up on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hits the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police Agency.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention unit and has been placed on $500 bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday where, when asked about his guilt, he declared that he was "certainly not guilty", the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting and possession of a firearm while intoxicated related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake that triggered the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a complete outage of power and communication, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located just off the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullah Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare death sentence for a federal crime not carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, knocking out pedestrians and cyclists in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to the death penalty request, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these items are punishable by death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and foresight", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucca, the request for sentencing said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last had a case that threatened the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty in New York was carried out in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment says.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting life in prison without the possibility of parole for pleading guilty, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saip's defense has previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the displeasure" of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have been "out of it" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faced in trying to unite her deeply divided ranks was highlighted by Conservatives who support staying in the EU and who joined a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks from both supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she continue with her attempts to strike a deal with Brussels despite negative reactions, and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the rally that going to Solihull meant he wanted to throw out the Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers".
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false".
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins, who was also at the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening.
In a stern message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers are able to keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage told the gathering that politicians must be made to "feel dissatisfied" if they are to defy the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people and our political elite", he said.
They're trying to fake Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that you're not going to get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the discontent.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" banners after forming a group this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for unimpeded border state, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
It's all a complete sham.
A good Brexit is not possible, he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a participatory meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Republican House Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using a participatory meeting format since Trump took office.
One of the people in attendance asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren countered that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the helm".
Arrested after LSU's Sims was shot.
Baton Rouge, LA police announced the arrest of a suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyton Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. at a press conference.
A video of the shooting was released Friday, asking for help in locating the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, which resulted in his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his order ensures him a win over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the team order would play a big part in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position for the first two laps and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first, leaving Hamilton behind to engage the traffic at the start, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the wheel-by-wheel action which reluctantly forced the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior at the risk of falling behind after a double-step move in the third corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race relying on his tyres to get to the fast finish and overtook Kimi Räikkönen in fourth place.
He finally got into the ring on lap 44, but failed to pick up the pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did a really remarkable job of getting a one-two finish in formation", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil, vicious and deceitful".
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and vicious and lying", he said.
When you look at the posts and the information that's been leaked, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release any information to the public?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public-- "but what?"
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't let it go public.
Well, hold on a second.
Did we let... No, we didn't, he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - yet Feinstein denied that the information had leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't release her story to the public.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, as she asked".
But her denial did not meet with the approval of the president, who commented at a rally on Saturday night: "To tell you the truth, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president insinuated that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power at any cost.
You see the malice, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, the media is reporting the president.
The elite league: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5 and 3.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Premier League on Friday with a 5-3 win in a rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants are up by two goals from Patrick Dwayer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to a tie before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard had tied for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lunwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Premier League season for Adam Keeff's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won their last three games.
Dwayer opened the scoring in the fourth minute, 3:35, with an assist from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the early rush, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game at 15:16.
Dwyer had secured the Giants' lead by the first period with the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a draw in the match play with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles jointly helped Nielsen to lead Dundee to the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored his fifth goal mid-final to secure his team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoided an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller declared a hero after he died ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area, with many trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu Airport that was swaying violently.
He stayed behind to ensure the safe takeoff of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was parked on the runway at the time.
When he realized the control tower was collapsing, he jumped off.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palo.
"Our hearts are breaking for this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the state disaster relief agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising as numerous bodies remain under the rubble, and many are inaccessible", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing bodies in every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working very hard to provide help to the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there".
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work around the clock to carry out all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN is reporting.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea reports that a person is missing after the plane crashed into a lagoon.
The airline whose plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one person is missing after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that they were unable to track the passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane went into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six more passengers were hospitalized Saturday and all are in stable condition.
It's still unclear what caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events was.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses think the plane went off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes stated that the plane was very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to make it to the emergency exit through waist-deep water in the sinking plane.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on repairs to the harbor also helped rescue the passengers in an inflatable boat that carried them to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none involving Air New Guinea.
The analyst is reconstructing the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday wrapped up a retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He testified before a jury that he used cell phone data to piece together a picture of the movements of defendant Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location data from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the records showed his phone was in the same location as Chambers's at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by the prosecution if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford stated that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers approximately two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted her texts, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He erased her from his life", said Halle.
The defense should begin its final statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expects a jury trial to follow later in the day.

Hip-hop wants to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when it dealt with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and bring back hip-hop's popularity.
Artists like the Fugees and Common are regaining popularity in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, calling the lawsuit "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016 to find that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"Not another black woman", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was not doing her job well and was expecting a Filipina instead, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got a day's pay and an Uber sent home.
Maurice is now suing the couple seeking severance pay, as well as a settlement of $350 a day for six months, the amount she was originally engaged to live with her family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, you see, you can't do these things", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to cancel Maurice's engagement because they were afraid that after they offended her, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, "said Post's husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you have offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, you know what?
Calling the lawsuit "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only been given two months of maternity leave and was in "a very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
That's not very nice, "the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public court was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not identify with the talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success.
Saying that her father, who, before being inspired to write a children's book by a teddy bear, worked for the BBC as a cameraman, would still be positive if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with both happiness and sadness following his death last year.
She also added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a way that kind of way.
Although he was a figment of his imagination, he always credited all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice after landing, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say he was in poor health, and that they didn't expect him to survive", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did that, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication her doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and stopped flowing through her bloodstream.
She died just moments before that and it all went out.
I could only sit and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep my cool.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I lowered my head, and tears flowed incessantly down my face.
It's hard to explain, but over the summer I was overwhelmed with compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Grief-stricken women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide want to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on Welsh Bridge are putting up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious laugh.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile would light up any room.
However, before his death, he left the job because he was in a "very dark phase".
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences".
Mrs. Davis designed these cards "so people know that there is someone you can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't just sit there and be quiet. Talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was moody, depressed or anything", she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at the bottom of his Christmas tree - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they have to get over it: "It leaves a huge void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we will keep going and fight.

With the FBI investigation now underway, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
"I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was asking for - a limited-duration and scope investigation - maybe it would bring us together to some extent", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break up" over irreconcilable partisan views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is caused by a choice of moment.
The congressional elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans do poorly, as expected, their bid to elect their man to the nation's highest court will be seriously undermined.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
It's going to be voted on in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast his vote to confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is declining under Kim.
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said 1,127 defectors were recorded last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the two decisive factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of the North Korean refugees will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean nationals have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often sends them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have noticeably improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stalled denuclearization talks.
This follows a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where a broad consensus was reached to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress so far on US sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is out of the question for us to unilaterally disarm first", RI said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman would be called 'hysterical' if she ever behaved like that", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford during a time when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and snapping when he spoke about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and orchestrated attacks on his personality" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself by his statements and the way he's been going against the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi backed down.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but not even the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's eventual convictions against the Affordable Care Act or in the case of Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to be put on trial and expected to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A justified rage, a rage that's been building up for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without paying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, what do you mean?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a CEO somewhere, and who said that she cries when she's angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then I'd just keep going.
And I thought it was great.
Tears are a permissible way to vent anger in part because they're basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my earlier job, in a mostly male office, is that one day, as I was crying out of indescribable rage, an older woman - a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"I never let them see me cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When in 1987 Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"That wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
With the campaign already behind schedule, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger at chauvinism -- that she had a cramp in her throat.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her.
"You'd think the Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my memorial?
"She cried?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The first cannons of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is not over yet, the rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest blow came this week with new tariffs hitting $200 billion worth of items, taxing virtually half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated with the same measure each time, the latest imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate with the U.S., and the world's second-largest economy doesn't seem to be going to a standstill anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means meeting the demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Yet experts say that if Beijing plays its next move well, US intervention in the trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for the onset of a collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers had believed", said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose Asia focus is at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is "ready for the return of refugees", says the foreign minister.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Now all the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling throughout the tournament, threw the opening shot into the water on the 16th hole, par 3, giving the fight to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in every round, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in this format in 1997.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Denmark's Throbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
The top-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter, for whom this may be his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia has become the all-time leading European tournament winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
"The team is important here and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, emotionally after the European victory.
He hands the relay to his compatriot John Rame who defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling to find its way to the hole all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing top-notch golf all tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There were moments this morning when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to have been their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're out of the woods.
